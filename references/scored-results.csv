While there, he heard rumors about the ""gold Bible"" and Joseph Smith's visions. Before he ever met Joseph Smith, Oliver became convinced the story was true and received revelation that he needed to assist Joseph (Doctrine and Covenants 6:14–24).1, 1:335; Richard Lloyd Anderson, ""Cowdery, Oliver,"" in Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History, ed.

Of Oliver's ability to stir the hearts of men to greater good Wilford Woodruff wrote, ""I have seen Oliver Cowdery when it seemed as though the earth trembled under his feet. I never heard a man bear a stronger testimony than he did when under the influence of the Spirit.""2 No wonder on December 5, 1834 Oliver was ordained an assistant to the Prophet Joseph. On that occasion Joseph said, ""I lay my hands upon thee and ordain thee an assistant-president to the High and Holy Priesthood, in the Church of the Latter-day Saints.""3 On April 3, 1836 Oliver was with Joseph as priesthood keys were received from ancient prophets Elijah, Elias, and Moses in the Kirtland Temple.

Although Oliver stands alone as the contemporary who received many glorious manifestations with the Prophet Joseph Smith, nine formal charges were drawn against him on April 7, 1838 before the Far West high council, including the charge that he urged vexatious law suits be brought against the Saints and the charge that he sought to destroy the character of the Prophet Joseph. Oliver refused to attend the high council meeting when the charges were discussed. ""*Give me my freedom or take my life!*"" he wrote. ""I shall no longer be bound by the chains of hell. I shall speak out when I see a move to deceive the ignorant.""4 After deliberating on the charges against Oliver, the Far West high council excommunicated him on April 12, 1838.

Although Oliver had lost fellowship with the Saints, Joseph Smith continued to reach out to him and encouraged the Quorum of the Twelve to do the same: ""Write to Oliver Cowdery and ask him if he has not eaten husks long enough? If he is not almost ready to return, be clothed with robes of righteousness, and go up to Jerusalem?""5 For years, Oliver rejected their entreaties.",3,

The young teacher prayed and received answers that Joseph Smith mentioned in a revelation (D&C 6:14-24). The Prophet's first history states the ""Lord appeared unto&#133;Oliver Cowdery and shewed unto him the plates in a vision and&#133;what the Lord was about to do through me, his unworthy servant. Therefore he was desirous to come and write for me to translate"" (*PJS* 1:10).

From April 7 through the end of June 1829, when they finished the translation, Joseph dictated while Oliver wrote, with ""utmost gratitude"" for the privilege (*Messenger and Advocate* 1:14). Oliver penned a letter then, expressing deep love for Christ, a lifetime theme. He later told how he and Joseph interrupted their work as they were translating the record of the Savior's post-resurrection American ministry, and how, as they prayed about baptism, they heard the ""voice of the Redeemer"" and were ministered to by John the Baptist, who gave them authority to baptize (JS-H 1:71,note).

In 1835 Oliver helped Joseph Smith correct and publish the revelations for the Doctrine and Covenants. Section 27 lists the major priesthood messengers of the restoration: John the Baptist, whom ""I have sent unto you, my servants, Joseph Smith, Jr., and Oliver Cowdery, to ordain you unto this first priesthood"" (D&C 27:8); and ""Peter, James, and John, whom I have sent unto you, by whom I have ordained you and confirmed you to be apostles and especial witnesses of my name, and bear the keys of your ministry"" (D&C 27:12).",2,

Would you like to have emblazoned on your soul an undeniable witness that the Savior descended beneath your sins and that there is no sin, no mortal plight outside the merciful reach of His Atonement—that for each of your struggles He has a remedy of superior healing power? Then read the Book of Mormon. It will teach you and testify to you that Christ's Atonement is infinite because it circumscribes and encompasses and transcends every finite frailty known to man.

No wonder the Book of Mormon proclaims with boldness, ""And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ"" (2 Nephi 33:10).

As Latter-day Saints gather and sing hymns of praise to the name of the Lord, they experience greater spiritual unity with one another and with the Lord.

Have you ever wondered why there are so many Christian churches in the world today when they obtain their doctrines from essentially the same Bible? It is because they interpret the Bible differently. If they interpreted it the same, they would be the same church. This is not a condition the Lord desires, for the Apostle Paul declared that there is ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism"" (Ephesians 4:5). To help bring this oneness about, the Lord established a divine law of witnesses. Paul taught, ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Corinthians 13:1).

The Bible is one witness of Jesus Christ; the Book of Mormon is another. Why is this second witness so crucial? The following illustration may help: How many straight lines can you draw through a single point on a piece of paper? The answer is infinite. For a moment, suppose that single point represents the Bible and that hundreds of those straight lines drawn through that point represent different interpretations of the Bible and that each of those interpretations represents a different church.

What happens, however, if on that piece of paper there is a second point representing the Book of Mormon?

To members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Book of Mormon forms the doctrinal foundation of the Church and speaks the word of God to all the world.

The Book of Mormon both confirms and supplements the Bible: ""Behold, this [the Book of Mormon] is written for the intent that ye may believe that [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe [the Book of Mormon] also"" (Morm. 7:9). The Bible is primarily a record of God's dealings with the forebears and descendants of Jacob or Israel in the ancient Near East. Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of God's dealings principally with another group of Israelites he brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem about 600 B.C. (see Lehi). They anticipated the birth and coming of Jesus Christ and believed in his Atonement and gospel. Their complex, lengthy records were abridged by a prophet named Mormon, inscribed on plates of gold, and buried by his son, Moroni 2, after internecine wars destroyed all of the believers in Christ in the New World except Moroni (A.D. 385).",3,

Three mutually supportive avenues are most often followed. First, the book serves as a source of guidance and doctrine, yielding lessons and wisdom applicable to contemporary life. This approach is recommended in the writings of Nephi, who wrote that he ""did liken the scriptures unto [his people], that it might be for [their] profit and learning"" (1 Ne. 19:23). Latter-day Saints find its pages rich with ennobling narratives, clear doctrines, eternal truths, memorable sayings, and principles. Knowing the conditions of the latter days, the ancient prophets periodically address the individual reader directly. Latter-day Saints emphasize the need to read the Book of Mormon prayerfully, with faith in God, to benefit personally from its teachings and to come unto Christ.

A second approach to the Book of Mormon, adding historical dimension to the first approach, is to study the book as an ancient text. The reader who accepts the Book of Mormon as an ancient Hebrew lineage history written by prophets in the New World will find the book consistent with that description and setting. The book is a repository of ancient cultures that are as far removed from modern readers as are those of the Old and New Testaments. Continuing research has found Hebrew poetic forms, rhetorical patterns, and idioms, together with many Mesoamerican symbols, traditions, and artifacts, to be implicit in the book or consistent with it.",3,

First in importance is the volume's affirmation that the Christian religion is grounded upon both the Old and New Testaments. The book affirms what recent biblical scholarship is now making plain: the continuity of the theology, ethics, and spirituality that the two Testaments proclaimed. In the Book of Mormon, Jesus is the Lord who gave the law to Moses, and the risen Christ is identical to the prophet Isaiah's messiah. He delivers exactly the same message of redemption, faith, and a new life of righteousness through the Holy Spirit that the New Testament attributes to him.

Second, the Book of Mormon reinforces the unifying vision of biblical religion, grounding it in the conviction of a common humanity that the stories of creation declared, God's promise to Abraham implied, and Jesus affirmed. Puritan millenarianism may have inspired an ethnocentric view of Anglo-Saxon destiny, but the image of the future in the Book of Mormon is a wholly opposite one. It envisions a worldwide conversion of believers and their final gathering into the kingdom of God. This begins where John Wesley's ""world parish"" leaves off.

Third, the biblical bond linking holiness to hope for salvation, both individual and social, also finds confirmation in the Book of Mormon. Certainly, Methodists had no corner on that linkage, for Baptist preachers, Charles G. Finney's Congregationalists, Alexander Campbell's Disciples of Christ, and Unitarians like William E. Channing affirmed it. Ancient Nephites heeded the word of their prophets and looked forward to the second coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of Righteousness. When he appeared to their descendants in the New World, Jesus repeated even more understandably the words of the Sermon on the Mount that he had proclaimed in the Old.",3,

He taught that the Book of Mormon ""proves that the Bible is true"" and that ""the two prove each other true.""17."") Brigham was so certain that sincere believers in the Bible would believe in the Book of Mormon, that he taught, ""we do not ask you to believe"" the Book of Mormon. ""What we do ask is that you will believe what is recorded in the Holy Bible …. Do this in all honesty and sincerity, then you will know that the Book of Mormon is true.""18. See also Journal of Discourses 1:38 (1854)."")

Several of Brigham Young's doctrinal teachings were also derived from the Book of Mormon as well.19 For example, Brigham taught, ""When God speaks to the people, he does it in a manner to suit their circumstances and capacities,"" a doctrine first explained by Nephi (2 Nephi 31:3).20. See also Doctrine and Covenants 1:24. For more on this idea, see Book of Mormon Central, ""Why Does the Lord Speak to Men 'According the Their Language' (2 Nephi 31:3),"" KnoWhy 258 (January 6, 2017)."")

Nephi prophesied that many ""plain and precious"" truths and covenants would be taken from the gospel and the Bible after the deaths of the apostles (1 Ne. 13:26-27). Many questions that have arisen from the Bible are answered for Latter-day Saints by the Book of Mormon, such as the mode of and reasons for baptism (2 Ne. 31; 3 Ne. 11:23-26); the proper way to administer the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper (Moro. 4-5); the nature of the Resurrection (Alma 40); the effects of the Fall of Adam, and the reasons for evil and suffering in the world (2 Ne. 2). The Book of Mormon reinforces the LDS doctrine that the gospel of Jesus Christ existed before the Creation and has been revealed to prophets and believers throughout time.

Also sacred to Latter-day Saints is the Book of Mormon as a tutor in discerning the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Many Latter-day Saints, including those born into LDS families, trace their conversion to Jesus Christ and their commitment toward the Church to prayerful study of the Book of Mormon, and through it they learn to recognize the Holy Spirit. Thus, the book becomes a continuing symbol of personal revelation and of God's love for and attention to the needs of each person. It also declares that all mankind will be judged by its precepts and commandments (Mosiah 3:24; Moro. 10:27; see Judgment). It is evidence that God remembers every creature he has created (Mosiah 27:30) and every covenant he has made (1 Ne. 19:15; 3 Ne. 16:11).

Sensing the impending destruction of his people, Mormon records that he concealed the plates of Nephi 1 and all the other records entrusted to him in a hill called Cumorah to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Lamanites (see Book of Mormon Plates and Records). He delivered his own abridgment of these records, called the plates of Mormon, and the small plates of Nephi, which he placed with them, to his son Moroni 2 (W of M 1:5; Morm. 6:6), who continued writing on them before burying them in an unmentioned site more than thirty-six years later (Moro. 10:1-2).

The Book of Mormon mentions a number of separate records that would have been part of Mormon's final record repository in the hill Cumorah. Though the contents of these can be known to us only to the extent that they are summarized or mentioned in the Book of Mormon, Latter-day Saints expect them someday to become available.

Widtsoe of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles recognized this when he wrote in 1950 that ""the hill from which the Book of Mormon plates were obtained is definitely known. In the days of the Prophet this hill was known among the people as Cumorah. This is a fixed point in Book of Mormon later history. There is a controversy, however, about the Hill Cumorah–––not about the location where the Book of Mormon plates were found, but whether it is the hill under that name near which Nephite events took place.""22 Elder Widstoe further explained that, ""As far as can be learned, Joseph Smith, translator of the book, did not say where, on the American continent, Book of Mormon activities occurred.""23

Much more important than precisely where the Book of Mormon hill Cumorah may be located is what transpired at a ""hill of considerable size"" near the town of Manchester, New York in the early morning hours of September 22, 1827 (Joseph Smith–––History 1:51–59). President Thomas S. Monson testified of ""the momentous events that unfolded"" on that occasion:

A plowboy prophet took a horse and wagon and, in the dark of night, rode to this hill, where he received an ancient record from the angel Moroni. In a remarkably short time, this untutored young man translated a record detailing 1,000 years of history and then prepared the Book of Mormon for public distribution. . . . The visitor often comes [to the Hill Cumorah] with an attitude of curiosity. He or she departs with a soul touched by the Spirit of the Lord. . . . I bear an apostolic witness that Jesus is the Savior of the world and that He and His Father appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith to usher in this dispensation of the fulness of times.24",3,

It was the *printer*, E.B. Grandin, who standardized the name as ""Camorah,"" not Joseph. In fact, Joseph was the one who had the name changed in subsequent editions to ""Cumorah,"" and even Oliver Cowdery admits the previous spelling was a mistake:

> *By turning to the 529th and 530th pages of the book of Mormon you will read Mormon's account of the last great struggle of his people, as they were encamped round this hill Cumorah. (**It is printed Camorah, which is an error**.)*

At the link above, FAIR also explains this change in the spelling makes the name more consistent with other Book of Mormon names, like ""Tean*cum*,"" ""*Cum*enihah,"" ""*Cum*eni,"" ""Mo*cum*,"" ""Morian*cum*er,"" and ""Riplian*cum*.""",0,

Moroni states in the book of Ether that the Jaredites gathered for battle near ""the hill Ramah,"" the same hill where his father, Mormon, hid up ""the records unto the Lord, which were sacred"" (Ether 15:11). It was near the first landing site of the people of Mulek (Alma 22:30), just north of the land Bountiful and a narrow neck of land (Alma 22:32).

The more common reference to Cumorah among Latter-day Saints is to the hill near present-day Palmyra and Manchester, New York, where the plates from which the Prophet Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon were found. During the night of September 21, 1823, Moroni 2 appeared to Joseph Smith as an angel sent from God to show him where these plates were deposited (JS-H 1:29-47).

In 1928 the Church purchased the western New York hill and in 1935 erected a monument recognizing the visit of the angel Moroni (see Angel Moroni Statue). A visitors center was later built at the base of the hill. Each summer since 1937, the Church has staged the Cumorah Pageant at this site. Entitled *America's Witness for Christ,* it depicts important events from Book of Mormon history. This annual pageant has reinforced the common assumption that Moroni buried the plates of Mormon in the same hill where his father had buried the other plates, thus equating this New York hill with the Book of Mormon Cumorah. Because the New York site does not readily fit the Book of Mormon description of Book of Mormon geography, some Latter-day Saints have looked for other possible explanations and locations, including Mesoamerica. Although some have identified possible sites that may seem to fit better (Palmer), there are no conclusive connections between the Book of Mormon text and any specific site that has been suggested.",3,

The process usually involves preliminary research, long periods of creating and revising multiple drafts, and collaborative editing. The Book of Mormon, however, was produced in a very different manner. Various witnesses claimed that its 269,510 words,1 originally printed onto 588 pages,2 were revealed to Joseph Smith through divinely prepared translation instruments by the gift and power of God.3 According to those present, the young 23-year-old prophet dictated the words of the Book of Mormon day after day, for hours on end, in the presence of multiple scribes and witnesses, without any outlines, preliminary drafts, working notes, reference materials, or substantive revisions.4

Creating a final draft of any lengthy document under these circumstances would be remarkable. Yet the production of the Book of Mormon is truly astounding when one takes into account the rapid pace of its translation. Based on a variety of source documents, it can now be firmly established that the English text of the Book of Mormon (as it was published in 1830) was essentially translated between April 7 and June 30, 1829.

This appeal to all people must involve many languages and the work of skilled translators. The King James Version of the Bible, for example, was produced by 50 English scholars who accomplished their work in seven years, translating at the rate of *one* page per day.39 Expert translators today do well if they can also translate scripture at the rate of one page per day.

In contrast, Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon at the rate of about *10* pages per day, completing the task in about 85 days (Many of us feel good if we can read the book in that time.)

Such a pace is even more remarkable considering the circumstances under which the Prophet labored. In that same period, while enduring constant distractions and incessant hostility, Joseph Smith moved more than 100 miles from Harmony, Pennsylvania, to Fayette, New York.41 He applied for a copyright.42 He received revelations comprising 12 sections of the Doctrine and Covenants.43 Heavenly beings restored the holy priesthood. Yet he completed the translation in less than three months.

The First Presidency provided opportunity for the Twelve Apostles to see portions of the original manuscript and the printer's manuscript of the Book of Mormon.

If Joseph Smith had hastily created the Book of Mormon on the fly or perhaps attempted to recall his prior plans for its contents from memory, then one might expect the book's plots, settings, and characters to be fairly simple and for any unnecessary or extraneous data to be limited.26 Instead, the text immediately throws readers into a believable ancient world, featuring over 337 proper names,27 a detailed and consistent internal geography,28 three calendar systems,29 a developed system of weights and measures,30 multiple migrations,31 complex narratives,32 cohesive doctrines,33 dozens of editorial promises,34 various underlying source texts,35 realistic battles,36 hundreds of poetic structures,37 pervasive intertextual relationships,38 multiple literary genres,39 scores of internally fulfilled prophecies,40 and other surprisingly sophisticated or unexpectedly consistent features.41

In other words, the Book of Mormon exhibits the variety and complexity that one might expect from a truly ancient compilation of records spanning approximately a thousand years of history. It looks nothing like what a young, marginally educated42 frontier farmer with no prior literary experience43 could be expected to produce in the span of about 60 working days, especially if he were deprived of notes, outlines, references materials, and the ability to make revisions. When these and other significant factors pertaining to the production of the Book of Mormon are duly considered,44 the breakneck speed of its translation is nothing short of astonishing.45",1,

On its face, the timeframe between April 7 and June 30 allows 85 possible days for the translation, but we know that on many of these days the translators were also engaged in other activities: doing farm chores, entertaining visitors, making trips to Colesville, receiving priesthood authority and additional revelations, baptizing Samuel and Hyrum Smith, moving from Harmony to Fayette, acquiring the Book of Mormon's copyright, and so forth.16

Book of Mormon scholar John W. Welch has suggested that with these known disruptions and time constraints accounted for, ""not many more than the equivalent of about 60 actual working days would have been available in April, May, and June 1829.""17 Terryl Givens has described this rate of translation as ""truly prodigious,""18 and Welch concluded that by ""any standard"" the pace was ""blistering.""19",2,

But, even still, there was one obstacle in the way of the translation. Translating the Book of Mormon into another language usually takes years to complete, even when someone is able to dedicate themselves to the task full-time.17 Because of the difficult economic circumstances facing Ukraine at the time, Zoya was not able to quit her full-time job as a teacher in order to dedicate herself to translating the Book of Mormon.18

According to President Biddulph, nobody was quite sure how she could possibly translate the Book of Mormon in a timely manner while working full-time, but she accepted the assignment anyway, knowing God would help her. And help her He did! Zoya completed the initial manuscript of the Ukrainian translation of the Book of Mormon in nineteen months, despite working full-time as an English teacher and serving as the district Young Women's president in Kiev.19

President Biddulph stated that Zoya told him of ""sacred experiences that came to her during the process of translation late into the night. She experienced the power of revelation and the gift of tongues in which words came to her in a spiritual stream, beyond her previous understanding and ability.""20 Because of this experience, ""her testimony of the Book of Mormon as a holy scripture of God has become profoundly strong.""21",1,

The Book of Mormon is presently in print in over eighty languages and is now being translated or prepared for publication in many, many more. Consider the Church's current process of translating the Book of Mormon from English into another language. The Church contracts capable, experienced member translators who are fluent in English as well as their native tongue who possess integrity and high moral character so that the spirit of inspiration will guide their work. Just as in Joseph Smith's day, the ability to translate holy writ today is a spiritual gift from God.

Unlike Joseph's day, however, many of our modern translators utilize computers and word processors, lexicons and encyclopedias to help and guide them in their sacred assignment. The modern work is extensive, and each step must be critically analyzed by Church translation experts. Yet, even with the most competent member translators and advanced technology available, the entire process, from beginning to publication, requires approximately four years.

Now contrast the translation of the Book of Mormon by young Joseph Smith. Joseph was raised on a farm in upstate New York and was only twenty-four years of age at the time he completed his translation of this sacred record from reformed Egyptian to English.",1,

Book of Mormon Translations

After the Prophet Joseph Smith's original translation of the Book of Mormon from the gold plates into English in 1829 and the return of those plates to the angel Moroni, no translations from English into other languages appeared until the 1850s. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Church produced translations of the Book of Mormon irregularly, often in groups of languages, and at widely separated intervals. However, in the 1970s and later, translations from the English text of the Book of Mormon became systematic and frequent.

Making the Book of Mormon and other Standard Works available in many languages is foreshadowed by the divine injunction ""that every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language"" (D&C 90:11). As missions were opened on the continent of Europe in 1850 and 1851, Church leaders in many of the newly opened missions mounted simultaneous translation efforts. The Danish edition (1851), produced by Erastus Snow for the Scandinavian Mission from a Danish translation by Peter Olsen Hansen, was the first printed (see SCANDINAVIA, THE CHURCH IN). At the same time, John TAYLOR supervised translations into French by Curtis E. Bolton and German by George P. Dykes, while Lorenzo SNOW was working on the Italian edition and John Davis on a Welsh one. All of these appeared in 1852, and culminated with George Q. Cannon's translation of the Book of Mormon into Hawaiian in 1855. No further translations we republished for twenty years.",1,

Joseph once commented that the book was ""translated into our own language"" (*TPJS*, p. 17; cf. D&C 1:24). In several chapters, for good and useful reasons, this meant that the language would follow the King James idiom of the day (*see CWHN* 8:212-16; Welch, 1990, pp. 134-63). It also assured that the manuscript would contain human misspellings and grammatical oddities, implying that if it had been translated in another decade its phraseology and vocabulary might have been slightly different.

At the same time, circumstantial evidence in the English text suggests that the translation was quite precise. For example, the independent and identical translations of 1 Nephi 1:8 andof Alma 36:22(precisely quoting twenty-one of Lehi's words in 1 Nephi 1:8) typify the internal accuracy manifested in this long and complex record. Moreover, several formulaic terms, Hebraisms, stylistic indications of multiple authorship, varieties of parallelism and extended chiasmus (see Book of Mormon Authorship; Book of Mormon Literature), as well as certain Semitic proper names and some textual variants, not at all evident from the King James Bible, corroborate the claim that the translation was faithful to a consistent underlying text.",1,

Nevertheless, the linguistic relationship between the English translation and the characters on the plates cannot be determined without consulting the Nephite original, which was returned to the angel Moroni in 1829 (see Moroni, Visitations of).Illustration

The Prophet Joseph Smith and a council of high priests collected the Prophet's early revelations in November 1831, into the Book of Commandments. They originally decided to print 10,000 copies of the book at Independence, Missouri, but later reduced this number to 3,000. As editor of the Church's newspaper called *The Evening and The Morning Star* and of the Book of Commandments, William W. Phelps also printed some of the major revelations in that paper during 1832-1833.

Publication plans were frustrated when a mob destroyed the printing establishment on July 20, 1833, when Phelps had printed only five 32-page signatures. These 160 pages contained sixty-five revelations, the last of which was not completely typeset. Although fire destroyed most of these uncut pages, Church members salvaged enough to put together about a hundred copies, only a few of which survive today. The revelations in the Book of Commandments became part of a larger collection titled the Doctrine and Covenants, first printed in 1835.

As he held up that copy of the Book of Mormon from the first edition, I thought of an experience we had a few years ago as we attended a mission presidents' seminar. At the closing of the two-day seminar in the Palmyra-Fayette area, we held a dinner in the reconstructed Peter Whitmer farmhouse, that beautiful little building where the Church was organized 168 years ago this weekend. It was such a moving occasion. The only cooking arrangement they had in that little log cabin was the fireplace. We looked at the fireplace, with a pot hanging where they did their cooking. They didn't have any of the conveniences of today, of course. There was a well outside for their water.

Near the end of that very spiritual meeting with those mission presidents, I walked up the stairs and looked at the two little bedrooms. The Peter Whitmer family lived there. But they turned one of those rooms over to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and there he did some of the translating of the Book of Mormon. Oliver Cowdery worked with him in that humble little setting.

An introductory statement in the 1921 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants explains that the lectures were deleted because ""they were never presented to nor accepted by the Church as being otherwise than theological lectures or lessons"" (see Doctrine and Covenants Editions). The decision may also have been influenced by what many readers have perceived as conflicts between statements about the Godhead in the fifth lecture and certain later revelations (D&C 130; Dahl and Tate, pp. 16-19). Others have found these conflicts to be more apparent than real and have attempted reconciliations (R. Millet, in Dahl and Tate, pp. 221-40).

The ""Lectures on Faith"" have been published separately from the Doctrine and Covenants for the LDS community four times: in 1840-1843, by Parley P. Pratt in England; in 1940, by compiler N. B. Lundwall in Salt Lake City; in 1985, by Deseret Book Company, Salt Lake City; and in 1990, by the Religious Studies Center at Brigham Young University. They were published separately twice by schismatic groups: in 1845-1846, by Sidney Rigdon (in Pittsburgh, soon after he left the Church); and in 1952, by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The Religious Studies Center publication includes a newly edited version of the lectures designed to make the text more readable. It provides textual comparison charts that identify all textual changes that have occurred in various printings of the lectures from 1835 to 1990. It also contains a summary of historical information, a doctrinal discussion of the topic of each lecture, and an extensive bibliography (Dahl and Tate).",3,

Williams, who compiled the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, said in the ""Lectures on Faith"" preface ""that it contains, in short, the leading items of the religion which we have professed to believe,"" and ""we have&#133;endeavored to present *our* belief, though in few words, and when we say this, we humbly trust that it is the faith and principles of this society as a body"" (Dahl and Tate, pp. 29-30).

Although it is impossible to evaluate the long-term impact of the lectures on LDS belief and teaching, the process of producing the lectures led early Church leaders to articulate and synthesize some of what they had learned from the revelations of the Restoration with the understanding of the Bible that they inherited from American Christianity. Although these lectures have received limited attention from most Latter-day Saints, others have taken them quite seriously and praised their value. LDS scripturalist and apostle Bruce R. McConkie wrote regarding the lectures, ""They were not themselves classed as revelations, but in them is to be found some of the best lesson material ever prepared on the Godhead; on the character, perfections, and attributes of God; on faith, miracles, and sacrifice. They can be studied with great profit by all gospel scholars"" (*MD*, p. 439). The 1990 republication of the lectures signals the desire of some LDS scholars to stimulate interest in their historical and doctrinal significance for the Church.

The school was organized to help Church leaders and missionaries ""[qualify] themselves as messengers of Jesus Christ, to be ready to do His will in carrying glad tidings to all that would open their eyes, ears, and hearts,"" by being ""more perfectly instructed in the great things of God"" (*HC* 2:169-70; *see also* Schools of the Prophets).

The lectures address three major themes: ""first, faith itself-what it is; secondly, the object on which it rests; and thirdly, the effects which flow from it"" (Dahl and Tate, p. 31). The first lecture explains what faith is; the second shows how the knowledge of God first came into the world and traces this knowledge from Adam to Abraham; the third and fourth discuss the necessary and unchanging attributes of God; the fifth deals with the nature of God the Father, his son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost; the sixth teaches that acquiring faith unto salvation depends on knowing that one's life is pleasing to God, which knowledge can be obtained only by the willingness to sacrifice all earthly things; and the seventh treats the fruits of faith-perspective, power, and ultimately perfection. In the 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants the seven lectures comprised seventy-four pages. The lectures are organized in numbered paragraphs in which principles are stated and supporting scriptures quoted. Appended to the first five lectures are lists of questions and answers restating the principles discussed. These catechisms are about as long as the lectures themselves.",1,

The same source indicates that in January 1835 Joseph was engaged in ""preparing the lectures on theology for publication"" (*HC* 2:180).

Renamed the *Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints*, the book was presented to, and accepted by, the members of the Church in an August 1835 conference as the word of God. The change in name to Doctrine and Covenants reflected a change in content. Unlike the Book of Commandments, which contained revelations only, the Doctrine and Covenants was divided into two parts. The new first part consisted of seven theological presentations now known as the Lectures on Faith but then titled ""On the Doctrine of the Church of the Latter Day Saints."" The part including the revelations published previously, the original preface, and a number of new revelations not in the 1833 compilation, were titled ""Part Second, Covenants and Commandments."" The title of the Doctrine and Covenants reflects the subtitles of these two parts.

In preparing the 1835 edition, Joseph Smith and a committee appointed to the task on September 24, 1834 (*HC* 2:165, 243-44) edited the revelations that had formerly appeared in the Book of Commandments. They corrected scribal and printing errors and occasionally clarified the text. They added explanations of the duties of officers that were new in the Church organization since the earlier revelations were received.

An 1835 edition, published in Kirtland, Ohio, was entitled *Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints* and contained 103 sections. In subsequent editions, more sections were added (see Doctrine and Covenants Editions). The most recent additions were sections 137 (1836) and 138 (1918) on salvation of the dead, and the Official Declaration 2 announcing the priesthood available to every worthy male member of the Church (1978). An article on marriage written by Oliver Cowdery in 1835 was deleted from the 1876 edition. Beginning with the 1921 edition, a set of lessons called the Lectures on Faith have not been included.

One hundred of the revelations were received before 1834, during the early, formative years of the Church. Many of them were addressed to specific individuals who sought wisdom from the Prophet. Gospel doctrines were often not revealed in their fulness at first, but were received progressively from time to time. As the Church grew and relocated, questions regarding Church administration, duties of officers, guidance for the members of the Church, and events of the future became the subjects of further revelations.

Not all the revelations received by Joseph Smith are included in the Doctrine and Covenants (see unpublished revelations). Some are contained in the *History of the Church*, giving counsel and instruction to individuals (*HC* 1:229), concerning the Saints being driven to the Rocky Mountains (*HC* 5:85), and a prophecy about Stephen A. Douglas (*HC* 5:393-94).",0,

Grant assigned a committee of six members of the Council of the Twelve to prepare a new edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. The major change in the 1921 edition was the removal of the ""Lectures on Faith,"" which were not considered to be revelations. The committee also revised the footnotes and divided the pages into double columns. Even though the name of the collection had been changed in the 1835 edition to signal the addition of the ""Lectures on Faith,"" it was not changed back when the lectures were deleted. The 1921 edition was the standard until 1981.

**THE 1981 EDITION.** A committee appointed by the First Presidency of the Church directed the publication of a new edition of the Doctrine and Covenants in 1981. New features included completely revised footnotes and rewritten introductory headings for each section. Two additional sections and a second official declaration were also incorporated. Section 137 is a portion of a vision of the Celestial Kingdom given to Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple on January 21, 1836. Section 138 is a vision about the redemption of the dead given to Joseph F. Smith, sixth President of the Church, in 1918. Official Declaration-2 is the 1978 announcement by the First Presidency that all worthy male members of the Church can be ordained to the priesthood.

**FOREIGN-LANGUAGE EDITIONS.** The Church has also published the Doctrine and Covenants in many languages other than English. Beginning in 1851 with the Welsh edition, the Doctrine and Covenants has been translated and published in its entirety in a score or more languages and selections from it in many others.

Because of our location in time and good record keeping, we are privileged to have an up close and personal view of the production of modern scriptural canon, and as we get into it, it's a bit of a rollercoaster. From its first publication in 1835 to its current version today, the Doctrine and Covenants has undergone major additions, deletions, rearrangements, and textual changes. In today's episode of *Church History Matters*, we'll take a ride through the history of this iterative production of the Doctrine and Covenants, from its earliest 1833 version, known as the Book of Commandments, to its 1835 version, which added new revelations and seven major theological lectures known as the Lectures on Faith, to the 1844 version, which added a few crucial revelations and was the last version most of the branches of the Restoration agreed upon after Joseph's death, to the 1876 version, which contained massive additions and rearranging, to the 1921 version, which decanonized the Lectures on Faith, and finally to the version we use today, which underwent revisions as recently as 2013. So please keep your arms and legs inside at all times as we now embark on our tour of the ongoing story of the Doctrine and Covenants. I'm Scott Woodward, and my co-host is Casey Griffiths.

It was the house of the Lord, a place where the Lord could come and appear to His people (Doctrine and Covenants 97:15–16; 109:5). It was a place for the ordinances of salvation and for being endowed ""with power from on high"" (Doctrine and Covenants 95:8; 124:38–40).

Although the exact details of the temple and its ordinances would be revealed over time, the Lord provided general information regarding its purposes early on, including through texts in the Book of Mormon.2, 37.

Nephi consecrated Jacob and Joseph to be priests and teachers (2 Nephi 5:26), and the Book of Mormon presents explicit instances of Jacob teaching at the temple (Jacob 1:17; 2:2, 11). Jacob declared that he had received revelation from the Lord regarding what he was to teach (Jacob 1:17; 2:11).

King Benjamin gathered his people to the temple so that he could teach them about the doctrines and covenants of the Lord (Mosiah 1:18; 2:1, 6). Like Jacob, Benjamin announced that the Lord gave him the words that he was going to share in this case ""by an angel from God"" (Mosiah 3:2). King Limhi similarly had his people ""gather themselves together to the temple, to hear the words which he should speak unto them"" (Mosiah 7:17).

The Book of Mormon, as abridged from various Nephite records, did not include many specifics regarding the internal operations of their temples and their holy ordinances. However, the book's numerous references to the temple would likely have served to emphasize to Joseph Smith and the early saints the significance of building and worshipping in such a sacred sanctuary. The Book of Mormon may have helped Joseph understand that it was appropriate to build temples whenever and wherever the people of God might find themselves.

Furthermore, as the prophet continued to receive revelations, he may well have noticed that many of their temple-related themes and teachings were already presented in his translation of the Book of Mormon. Perhaps the gleanings were somewhat obvious and basic at first, but as Joseph continued to be divinely tutored on the subject, the intricacies of temple worship would have become more and more noticeable to him and other early saints.",2,

> In light of all that can be said about temples in the Book of Mormon, it is finally well to remember that in 1829, when the Book of Mormon was translated, Joseph Smith had scarcely thought or dreamed of a temple. Two years later he and the Church would move to Kirtland, where a temple was dedicated in 1836. … In retrospect, we can see today that the blueprint of the Restoration for worshiping the Lord Jesus Christ in his holy house was already largely embedded in the texts of the Book of Mormon.15, 377."")

Descriptions like those found in Psalms 24, 42, 68, 95, 118, 122, and 132 suggest that periodic pilgrimages to the house of the Lord were an important part of ancient temple worship. The people of Israel would ascend up to Jerusalem and enter the temple grounds in order to be taught the word of God, offer sacrifices, and participate in other temple rites.

These pilgrimages were probably quite similar to the gatherings at the temple that we read about in the Book of Mormon, such as those in which Jacob (2 Nephi 6–10; Jacob 2–3) and King Benjamin (Mosiah 1–6) taught their people. It is evident that Jacob, for example, understood the relevance of these particular psalms to his temple teachings because he used parts of Psalms 95, 118, and 145 in his writings.3,"" KnoWhy 62 (March 25, 2016)."")",3,

The physical structure as such is not the source of its holiness. Rather, the character of those who enter and the sacred ordinances and instructions received there nurture the spiritual atmosphere found in the temple. When members enter this holy house and center their thoughts on serving others, their own understandings are clarified and solutions to personal problems are received.

Because of the spiritual nature of temple activity, personal preparation is essential. Latter-day Saints insist that temple ceremonies are sacred. This is consistent with ancient practice when, for example, only specifically qualified persons were admitted into the holiest precincts of the Tabernacle.

Each one is literally a house of the Lord—a place where He and His spirit may dwell, where He may come or send others to confer priesthood blessings and to give revelation to His people.

Temples built especially to the Lord have been erected in all ages. Moses built a tabernacle in the wilderness for the children of Israel. Solomon built a magnificent temple in Jerusalem. The Nephites built sacred temples. Joseph Smith built houses of the Lord in Kirtland and Nauvoo, and succeeding prophets have built temples throughout the world. These have all been initiated and built under the direction and revelation of God.

Without revelation, temples can neither be built nor properly used. They are one of the evidences of the divinity of our Lord's true gospel. In our day, the Lord has said: ""How shall your washings be acceptable unto me, except ye perform them in a house which you have built to my name? … that … ordinances might be revealed which had been hid from … the world.""

In *every* age, the temple has underscored the precious truth that those who make covenants with God and keep them are children of the covenant.

Thus, in the house of the Lord, we can make the same covenants with God that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob made. And we can receive the same blessings!

Temples have been part of *this* dispensation from its earliest days.8 Elijah committed the keys of sealing authority to Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple. The fulness of the priesthood was restored in the Nauvoo Temple.9

Until his martyrdom, Joseph Smith continued to receive revelations that furthered the restoration of the endowment and sealing ordinances.10 He recognized, however, that further refinement was needed. After administering the endowment to Brigham Young in May 1842, Joseph told Brigham, ""This is not arranged right, but we have done the best we could under the circumstances in which we are placed, and I wish you to take this matter in hand and organize and systematize all these ceremonies.""11

Following the Prophet's death, President Young oversaw the completion of the Nauvoo Temple12 and later built temples in the Utah Territory. At the dedication of the lower stories of the St. George Temple, Brigham Young vigorously declared the urgency of vicarious temple work when he said, ""When I think upon this subject, I want the tongues of seven thunders to wake up the people.""13",2,

Bible prophecies indicate that in the last dispensation of the gospel, there would be a restoration of all of the principles and practices of former dispensations, which includes temple-building and the performing of ordinances therein. (See Isa. 2:2–3; Micah 4:1–2; Acts 3:19–21; Eph. 1:9–10.)

A latter-day Apostle wrote: ""The history of Temples teaches us that the people of God have been strong, or weak, in proportion to the faithfulness with which they have attended to their sanctuaries.""

This is the work of home teachers, quorum presidents, bishops, and especially high priests, as well as all others involved in teaching the gospel. I remember one elders quorum president who determined that his leadership objective would be to help every member in his quorum to go to the temple. His initial report stated that all but six had qualified. He later reported that all but three had gone before he was released. After his release, however, they ""got"" the other three.

Having the privilege of working each day in the administration of the temples, I am constantly impressed with the richness, the holiness, and the glory of the blessings administered there. Questions come to us about the ordinances performed in the temple. We, of course, are not permitted to discuss them outside the temple, because of their sacred nature. Others press for a preparatory orientation so that those who enter the temple will not be confused. I want to emphasize that *the preparation to enter the temple lies in the gospel.* Nothing is said or done in the temple which does not have its foundation in the scriptures.

The gospel is *faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ.* This implies a willingness to accept His doctrine and take upon us His name, being obedient to His commandments. *The gospel is repentance* and a cleansing from all iniquity. *It is baptism* whereby we have made the covenant and promise. It is the right to have the *companionship of the Holy Ghost,* which, when we have a correct frame of mind, will teach us as we go through the temple. *The gospel is the scriptures.* The answer to almost any appropriate question about the temple will be found in the scriptures for those who seek it. *The gospel is prayer, humility, teachableness, charity.* It is *commitment* and it is *covenant* and *ordinances.* It is also *blessings.*",1,

1. The Restoration is a process, not an event, and will continue until the Lord comes again.
2. The ultimate objective of the gathering of Israel15 is to bring the blessings of the temple to God's faithful children.
3. As we seek how to accomplish *that* objective more effectively, the Lord reveals more insights. The ongoing Restoration needs ongoing revelation.

The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have often asked the Lord if there are better ways to take the blessings of the temple to His faithful children. We seek guidance regularly on how to ensure worldwide accuracy and consistency of temple instruction, covenants, and ordinances despite differences in language and culture.

Under the Lord's direction and in answer to our prayers, recent procedural adjustments have been made. *He* is the One who wants you to understand with great clarity exactly what you are making covenants to do. *He* is the One who wants you to experience fully *His* sacred ordinances. *He* wants you to comprehend your privileges, promises, and responsibilities. *He* wants you to have spiritual insights and awakenings you've never had before. This He desires for *all* temple patrons, no matter where they live.

Current adjustments in temple procedures, and others that will follow, are continuing evidence that the Lord is actively directing His Church. He is providing opportunities for each of us to bolster our spiritual foundations more effectively by centering our lives on Him and on the ordinances and covenants of His temple. When you bring your temple recommend, a contrite heart, and a seeking mind to the Lord's house of learning, *He* will teach you.",0,

First, they symbolically and literally remind us and teach us about Christ and His Father. We know that Christ spent key parts of His ministry at the temple in Jerusalem (see John 7–8; Matt. 21–23; Mark 11–12; Luke 20), and drew frequently on temple symbolism in His teachings, often comparing Himself to symbols used in the temple, such as light and water (see, for example, John 7:38; John 8:12). Our temple worship today includes many symbolic references to Christ, from the spires on the outside that point our minds heavenward, to the white clothing we wear inside the temple to symbolize that, as the book of Revelation says, we have come ""out of great tribulation, and have washed [our] robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb"" (Rev. 7:14).

Temples stand as a constant physical reminder of the grace and the goodness of the Father. This helps communities of Saints strengthen themselves. President George Q. Cannon said: ""Every foundation stone that is laid for a temple, and every temple completed … lessens the power of Satan on the earth, and increases the power of God and Godliness"" (Logan Temple cornerstone ceremony, 19 Sept. 1877; quoted in Nolan Porter Olsen, *Logan Temple: The First 100 Years* , 34).",2,

Eight men were called as General Authorities. Six women were called to the presidencies of the Relief Society and Young Women. Over two hundred men were called to serve as bishops, and over seventeen hundred men and women were called as full-time missionaries. In that same month, tens of thousands of others were called as officers and teachers and other workers in the many Church organizations throughout the world. Those called in April joined millions of others already serving in similar capacities in the restored Church.

As I contemplated my own calling and the callings of millions of others already in service, I was led to consider this question: Why do we serve?

Service is an imperative for those who worship Jesus Christ. To followers who were vying for prominent positions in his kingdom, the Savior taught, ""Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant."" (Matt. 20:27.) On a later occasion, he spoke of ministering to the needs of the hungry, the naked, the sick, and the imprisoned. He concluded that teaching with these words: ""Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."" (Matt. 25:40.)",2,

He said, ""I don't want to go."" I asked, ""What has that got to do with it? We need you.""

President Kimball has said we don't have *half enough* missionaries. Can't you see that it doesn't matter whether you want to go or not? You're needed! Do you know what it means to be needed? The bonds of brotherhood are forged deep and strong in the mission field. You will develop a love for a companion with whom you kneel in daily prayer. You will learn to love the people where you serve, no matter what nationality or condition. And they will love you. They will love you because you brought them the gospel.

Converts always remember those who taught them. I've heard many converts speak almost reverently of ""our missionaries."" Imagine having people pray for you. Do you understand what that means? This will always be a purifying and refining influence in your life.

Many people out there are praying for the truth. You are the one who can bring it to them best. At present only 18,000 of you are serving. There are nearly 60,000, 19 through 25, who have not. We need more, many more. Missionary service is not preempted by any other thing. Marriage does not take precedence. Your work does not have priority. Your education is interrupted to fill this calling. College-related activities may be timed to satisfy both school and mission requirements. Some of you may be physically handicapped. There may yet be opportunity to serve in fitting ways locally.

Your moral worthiness is a prime consideration. We want no flabbiness of character when spiritual strength is required. Study! Get some colored pencils. Keep them with your Book of Mormon. Underline verses important to you. Another tool of missionary work is an additional language. Study one. We should ""become acquainted with … languages, tongues, and people."" (D&C 90:15.)",3,

People serve one another for different reasons, and some reasons are better than others. Perhaps none of us serves in every capacity all the time for only a single reason. Since we are imperfect beings, most of us probably serve for a combination of reasons, and the combinations may be different from time to time as we grow spiritually. But we should all strive to serve for the reasons that are highest and best.

What are some of the reasons for service? By way of illustration, and without pretending to be exhaustive, I will suggest six reasons. I will discuss these in ascending order from the lesser to the greater reasons for service.

Some may serve for hope of earthly reward. Such a man or woman might serve in Church positions or in private acts of mercy in an effort to achieve prominence or cultivate contacts that would increase income or aid in acquiring wealth.

There is far greater flexibility in the service opportunities of couples than for single elders or sisters. In consultation with your bishop, you can indicate your own preferences for missionary service. We must train a growing number of fathers and mothers and priesthood and auxiliary leaders throughout the world who want very much to serve the Lord but simply do not know how to do it. You can help them as a leadership missionary couple. You can serve in temples, family history, educational and medical activities, welfare service projects, public affairs, and visitors' centers. There is a need for almost every discipline of life. There is undoubtedly a need somewhere in the world for your unique capacities and talents. Often special health considerations can be accommodated. The feelings you express to the bishop are communicated in a recommendation for a call. The President of the Church has made it possible for those calls to be inspired of the Lord, taking into consideration your special needs and desires as a couple. Stake presidents and bishops are kept aware of current full-time missionary needs. If you cannot find anyone locally to identify potential missionary opportunities, write to the Missionary Department at headquarters. We will send you a list of the current needs. I encourage each couple with available time to prayerfully consider a full-time mission. You will be greatly blessed for the courage to accept a call.

As the Apostle Paul said, we that are strong enough to bear the infirmities of the weak should not do so ""to please ourselves."" (Rom. 15:1.) Reasons aimed at earthly rewards are distinctly lesser in character and reward than the other reasons I will discuss.

Some may serve out of fear of punishment. The scriptures abound with descriptions of the miserable state of those who fail to follow the commandments of God. Thus, King Benjamin taught his people that the soul of the unrepentant transgressor would be filled with ""a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.""

With so many converts the little branches grow rapidly. New leaders are called to positions of service early. They are able but inexperienced in Church procedures and administration. These new leaders, as well as older ones, need to be taught how to organize the Church correctly and cause it to function properly. Who is available to teach these principles?

The decision to serve a mission will shape the spiritual destiny of the missionary, his or her spouse, and their posterity for generations to come. A desire to serve is a natural outcome of one's conversion, worthiness, and preparation.

Our young missionaries set aside their education, occupation, dating, and whatever else young adults would typically be doing at this stage of life. For 18 to 24 months they put it all on hold because of their deep desire to serve the Lord.2 And some of our missionaries serve in their more mature years of life. I know their families are blessed.

These are those I would call the good soldiers, who instinctively do what they are asked without question and sometimes without giving much thought to the reasons for their service. Such persons fill the ranks of voluntary organizations everywhere, and they do much good. We have all benefited by the good works of such persons. Those who serve out of a sense of duty or loyalty to various wholesome causes are the good and honorable men and women of the earth.

Service of the character I have just described is worthy of praise and will surely qualify for blessings, especially if it is done willingly and joyfully. As the Apostle Paul wrote in his second letter to the Corinthians:

""But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

""Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver."" (2 Cor. 9:6–7.)

""It is obeying God willingly that is accepted,"" an anonymous writer has said. ""The Lord hates that which is forced—it is rather a tax than an offering.""",3,

Missionary work results in many rejections. It is easy to be discouraged. ""And ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect; for mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts.""6

Third, be obedient, faithful, and true. Missionaries serve in companionships for protection. A missionary best protects his companion when he is loyal to the Lord and helps his companion. By keeping the missionary rules, you gain the freedom of having the Spirit assist you.

Fourth, teach and testify. ""And ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two, in my name, lifting up your voices as with the sound of a trump, declaring my word like unto angels of God.""7",1,

As you prayerfully seek and cultivate missionary opportunities in your daily activities, you will find many ways to serve. They include helping to find, convert, and retain new members. The stake or full-time missionaries can teach you how to do that.

You can help the full-time and stake missionaries bring new investigators to church and make them feel comfortable. Let them know that they have a new friend. Strengthen that friendship by inviting them to your home or to Church activities with you. You can support them in obeying the commandments. Such valuable missionary service is not difficult because it can be carried out in the normal routine of your daily life.

There are other ways you may not think of as missionary service. For example, a young mother can teach each growing son to prepare to be a missionary to preach the gospel and to share his testimony of truth. As mother and father cultivate that thought throughout his growing years, he will be a missionary. That is excellent missionary service.",2,

The Savior applied that principle in the Sermon on the Mount, in which he commanded us to love our enemies, bless them that curse us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them that despitefully use us and persecute us. (See Matt. 5:44.) He explained the purpose of that commandment as follows:

""For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?

""And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?"" (Matt. 5:46–47.)

This principle—that our service should be for the love of God and the love of fellowmen rather than for personal advantage or any other lesser motive—is admittedly a high standard. The Savior must have seen it so, since he joined his commandment for selfless and complete love directly with the ideal of perfection. The very next verse of the Sermon on the Mount contains this great commandment: ""Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."" (Matt. 5:48.)

This principle of service is reaffirmed in the fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants:

""Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day."" (D&C 4:2.)

We learn from this command that it is not enough to serve God with all of our *might and strength.* He who looks into our hearts and knows our minds demands more than this. In order to stand blameless before God at the last day, we must also serve him with all our *heart and mind.*

Service with all of our heart and mind is a high challenge for all of us. Such service must be free of selfish ambition. It must be motivated only by the pure love of Christ.",0,

I use the word *command* advisedly, for it seems to be an insistent directive from which we, singly and collectively, cannot escape.

After receiving revelation, the Three Witnesses felt they shared equally with Joseph Smith in foundational experiences, and their certainty about a past vision contributed to their inflexibility concerning future revelations. They sided with the Prophet's critics who reacted negatively to the failure of the Kirtland Safety Society (see Kirtland Economy), and they opposed Joseph Smith's vigorous doctrinal and administrative leadership. After their excommunication, each felt deep rejection, resulting, predictably, in their harsh criticisms of Church leadership. Even in these circumstances, each of the Three Witnesses continued to maintain vigorously the authenticity of their published testimony. None expressed any doubt as to what they had testified. Both Oliver Cowdery and Martin Harris returned to the Church at the end of their lives; David Whitmer retained religious independence but to the end aggressively defended the Book of Mormon.

Skeptics have discounted the ""Testimony of Three Witnesses"" on the ground of collusion or deception. Yet each of the three was a respected and independent member of non-Mormon society, active in his community. Their lives, fully documented, clearly demonstrate their honesty and intelligence. David Whitmer repeatedly reacted against charges of possible ""delusion."" To one skeptic, he responded: ""Of course we were in the spirit when we had the view&#133;but we were in the body also, and everything was as natural to us, as it is at any time"" (Anderson, p. 87).

They witness that these writings ""have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us.""

Each of the three had ample reason and opportunity to renounce his testimony if it had been false, or to equivocate on details if any had been inaccurate. As is well known, because of disagreements or jealousies involving other leaders of the Church, each one of these three witnesses was excommunicated from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by about eight years after the publication of their testimony. All three went their separate ways, with no common interest to support a collusive effort.

Reject it one may, but how does one explain three men of good character uniting and persisting in this published testimony to the end of their lives in the face of great ridicule and other personal disadvantage?

Witnesses and witnessing are vital in God's plan for the salvation of His children. In the Godhead, the function of the Holy Ghost is to bear witness of the Father and the Son (see 2 Ne. 31:18). The Father has borne witness of the Son (see Matt. 3:17; Matt. 17:5; John 5:31–39), and the Son has borne witness of the Father (see John 17). The Lord has commanded His servants to testify of Him (see Isa. 43:10; Mosiah 18:9; D&C 84:62), and all of the prophets have borne witness of Jesus Christ (see Acts 10:43; Rev. 19:10).

The scriptures state that ""in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Cor. 13:1; D&C 6:28; see also Deut. 19:15). The most important ordinances of salvation—baptism, marriage, and other ordinances of the temple—are required to have witnesses (see D&C 127:6; D&C 128:3).

The Bible witnesses of Jesus Christ by prophecies of His coming, by accounts of His ministry, and by the testimonies of those who carried His message to the world. The Book of Mormon has the same content: witnesses preceding, during, and following the ministry of the Messiah. Appropriately, it is now titled ""Another Testament of Jesus Christ.""",0,

Not only do these interviews provide abundant evidence of his abiding testimony in the Book of Mormon but they also outline how David's views about Christ's church and priesthood authority had changed.

By that point, two key beliefs had become prominent for David Whitmer: (1) that he himself was Joseph Smith's ordained successor and (2) that most of the revelations Joseph had received after 1830, especially those that came after David's excommunication during the theologically progressive Nauvoo era, were false.14 These beliefs became impenetrable roadblocks to David Whitmer's return to full fellowship with the Saints.

There were also social factors that played a role in keeping David and the rest of the Whitmers from returning to the Church. Both Oliver Cowdery and Martin Harris spent most of the time they were disassociated from the Church in isolation from any fellow Book of Mormon believers. For some time, such isolation may have contributed to bitterness and harbored grudges, but eventually it gave way to humble reflection, reminiscence, and yearning to reunite with the people of God.

David, however, was surrounded by his family. The Whitmers all shared the same disagreements over the direction the Church was taking in 1837–1838 and collectively separated themselves from the Church at that time. On one hand, this meant they had a small but strongly committed social group of Book of Mormon believers—many of whom were Book of Mormon Witnesses—which no doubt helped all of them keep their faith in that sacred volume of scripture.",0,

When Joseph Smith first obtained the gold plates, he was told to show them to no one. As translation progressed, he and those assisting him learned, both in the pages of the Book and by additional revelation, that three special witnesses would know, by the power of God, ""that these things are true"" and that several besides himself would see the plates and testify to their existence (Ether 5:2-4; 2 Ne. 27:12-13; D&C 5:11-13). The testimonies of the witnesses affirm that these things occurred.

The witnesses were men known for truthfulness and sobriety. Though each of the Three Witnesses was eventually excommunicated from the Church (two returned), none ever denied or retracted his published testimony. Each reaffirmed at every opportunity the veracity of his testimony and the reality of what he had seen and experienced.

A June 1829 revelation confirmed that Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris would be the Three Witnesses (D&C 17). Soon thereafter, they, with Joseph Smith, retired to the woods near Fayette, New York, and prayed for the promised divine manifestation. The ""Testimony of Three Witnesses"" summarizes the supernatural event that followed, when an angel appeared and showed them the plates and engravings and they heard the Lord declare that the Book of Mormon was ""translated by the gift and power of God."" They said that the same divine voice ""commanded us that we should bear record of it.""

Joseph Smith's mother later recounted Joseph's great relief at no longer being the sole witness of the divine experiences of the restoration (see Law of Witnesses). That others had also seen an angel and ""will have to testify to the truth of what I have said for now they know for themselves"" relieved him of a great burden (Lucy Smith Preliminary Manuscript, Church Archives).",2,

This law applies in divine as well as human relations, for members of the Godhead bear witness of one another (John 5:31-37; 3 Ne. 11:32), and books of holy writ give multiple witness to the work of God in the earth (2 Ne. 29:8-13). The law of witnesses is prominent in the history and practice of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

A witness gives personal verification of, or attests to the reality of, an event. To ""witness"" in the scriptural sense is much the same as in the legal sense: to give personal testimony based on firsthand evidence or experience. To bear false witness is a very serious offense (Deut. 5:20;19:16-21).

In legal affairs, testimony is usually related to what a person knows by the physical senses. In spiritual matters there is additional knowledge or information received through the Holy Spirit.",0,

Of the perhaps 200 recorded interviews with the Three Witnesses, a significant percentage stress the spiritual intensity of the witnesses as they described the angel and the plates. By themselves, the Prophet's reputation and claims were vulnerable, but the testimony of additional reputable, solemn witnesses who shared a divine experience added credibility.

Lucy Smith's autobiography records the overwhelming gratitude of the Three Witnesses as they returned to the Whitmer house after sharing this experience. Joseph Smith's own history gives the fullest details of the event: repeated prayers followed by a vision given simultaneously to the Prophet, Cowdery, and Whitmer, and soon after a nearly identical vision experienced by the Prophet with Harris. According to Joseph, the intense glory of God enveloped the natural surroundings, and in this divine light the angel appeared, carefully displayed the plates, specifically counseled David Whitmer-the only one of the three who did not eventually return to the Church-to endure to the end, and the voice of God declared the book divine (*HC* 1:54-56).",0,

Joseph once commented that the book was ""translated into our own language"" (*TPJS*, p. 17; cf. D&C 1:24). In several chapters, for good and useful reasons, this meant that the language would follow the King James idiom of the day (*see CWHN* 8:212-16; Welch, 1990, pp. 134-63). It also assured that the manuscript would contain human misspellings and grammatical oddities, implying that if it had been translated in another decade its phraseology and vocabulary might have been slightly different.

At the same time, circumstantial evidence in the English text suggests that the translation was quite precise. For example, the independent and identical translations of 1 Nephi 1:8 andof Alma 36:22(precisely quoting twenty-one of Lehi's words in 1 Nephi 1:8) typify the internal accuracy manifested in this long and complex record. Moreover, several formulaic terms, Hebraisms, stylistic indications of multiple authorship, varieties of parallelism and extended chiasmus (see Book of Mormon Authorship; Book of Mormon Literature), as well as certain Semitic proper names and some textual variants, not at all evident from the King James Bible, corroborate the claim that the translation was faithful to a consistent underlying text.",1,

His translation was not done in the usual manner of a scholar, but was a revelatory experience using only an English text. He did not leave a description of the translating process, but it appears that he would read from the KJV and dictate revisions to a scribe.

Joseph Smith was assisted by various scribes. The manuscript shows that Oliver Cowdery was the first, serving between June and October 1830; he recorded an introductory revelation (Moses 1) and the translation of KJV Genesis 1:1to Genesis 4:18. John Whitmer served second, from October until December 1830, recording the translation of KJV Genesis 4:19to approximately Genesis 5:20. Sidney Rigdon was next, becoming the main scribe from early December 1830 until the translation was finished on July 2, 1833. He recorded most of the translation from KJV Genesis 5:21to the end of the Bible, although others recorded small portions.",2,

The message of the Bible is held to be true, while details of accuracy and completeness are accepted within certain limits. The Prophet Joseph Smith explained: ""I believe the Bible as it read when it came from the pen of the original writers. Ignorant translators, careless transcribers, or designing and corrupt priests have committed many errors"" (*TPJS*, p. 327). And again, ""From sundry revelations which had been received, it was apparent that many points touching the salvation of men, had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled"" (*TPJS*, pp. 9-10).

Joseph Smith often used the words ""translated"" and ""translation,"" not in the narrow sense alone of rendering a text from one language into another, but in the wider senses of ""transmission,"" having reference to copying, editing, adding to, taking from, rephrasing, and interpreting. This is substantially beyond the usual meaning of ""translation."" When he said the Bible was not translated correctly, he not only was referring to the difficulties of rendering the Bible into another language but he was also observing that the manuscripts containing the text of the Bible have suffered at the hands of editors, copyists, and revisionists through centuries of transmission. Thus, the available texts of the Bible are neither as complete nor as accurate as when first written.",3,

He and several of his close associates testified that the translation was accomplished ""by the gift and power of God"" (*Hc* 1:315; see also D&C 1:29;20:8).

Little is known about the translation process itself. Few details can be gleaned from comments made by Joseph's scribes and close associates. Only Joseph Smith knew the actual process, and he declined to describe it in public. At a Church conference in 1831, Hyrum Smith invited the Prophet to explain more fully how the Book of Mormon came forth. Joseph Smith responded that ""it was not intended to tell the world all the particulars of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon; and&#133;it was not expedient for him to relate these things"" (*HC* 1:220).",3,

The translation process was revelatory and educational, and was a means of expanding the Prophet Joseph Smith's knowledge and doctrinal awareness (cf. D&C 45:60-61). The contributions, therefore, go beyond the particular biblical text that may have initiated the process. Among the doctrines of the LDS Church that arose from the JST translation process are the building of Zion, patterned after Enoch's city; the age of accountability of children, with baptism at eight years; the extensive revelation about the degrees of glory and plural marriage (including celestial, eternal marriage); and various items of priesthood organization and responsibility. These and other doctrines were often introduced during the translation process and later developed through subsequent revelations now contained in the Doctrine and Covenants. Revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants received during the translation process are sections 76, 77, 86, and 91, and parts of 107 and 132. In this way the JST has affected the spiritual life of every member of the Church, even though most of the members have not known of the JST.

The tangible product-the printed JST-consists of a Bible with thousands of unique corrections, additions, and readings. Although many Latter-day Saints regard this as the most correct version of the Bible now available, and therefore use it as a valuable source for biblical understanding, the wider contribution has probably been the enlightening effect that the process had upon Joseph Smith and the subsequent revelations through him that have shaped Church doctrine and practice. Most of the doctrinal and organizational revelations that have governed the Church, and that are now published in the Doctrine and Covenants, came to Joseph Smith during the period that he was translating the Bible (1830-1833).",1,

""When Joseph Smith began translating the Book of Mormon in 1827, he usually left the plates in a box or wrapped in a cloth, placed the interpreters or his seer stone (both of which seem to have been called Urim and Thummim) in a hat, and read the translation he saw in the stone to a scribe. . . . When the first 116 pages of the Book of Mormon were stolen, an angel took back the interpreters, and Joseph instead used his seer stone.""8 All of this suggests that Joseph Smith's mechanism for translating the Book of Mormon, while still in some way conveying one language (Egyptian) to another (English), was more closely synonymous with revelation.9",3,

For example, an entry in Joseph Smith's journal under the date November 20, 1835 indicates the Prophet ""spent the day in translating"" the Egyptian records.2 In an unpublished editorial that was apparently meant to be printed in the March 1, 1842 issue of the *Times and Seasons* (the issue that saw the publication of the first installment of the Book of Abraham), Joseph Smith signaled his desire to ""continue to translate and publish [the text] as fast as possible [until] the whole is completed.""3 What was published with the Book of Abraham was a preface announcing it as ""A TRANSLATION Of some ancient Records that have fallen into our hands . . . purporting to be the writings of Abraham.""4

But while Joseph Smith and others used the word ""translation"" to describe the production of the Book of Abraham, the *means* or *methods* Joseph used to translate ancient scripture were unique. Rather than utilizing dictionaries, grammar books, and lexicons, Joseph translated scripture through revelation. This can be seen in the other efforts Joseph Smith undertook throughout his prophetic ministry to produce other books of scripture.5",2,

While it is arguable that a handful of Joseph Smith's revisions to the KJV Bible are indeed more precise renderings of the underlying Greek and Hebrew, or that the larger portions revealed by the Prophet in some way correspond to now-lost ancient manuscripts, this once again indicates the broad range of meaning the Prophet applied to this term.",1,

This appointment can be illustrated by excerpts from his writings. After laboring off and on for ten months on the early chapters of Genesis, Joseph Smith received a revelation from the Lord on March 7, 1831, directing him to begin work on the New Testament: ""It shall not be given unto you to know any further concerning this chapter, until the New Testament be translated, and in it all these things shall be made known; wherefore I give unto you that ye may now translate it"" (D&C 45:60-61). The manuscript of the JST shows that Joseph Smith began the translation of Matthew the next day. On December 1, 1831, the Prophet entered the following in his journal: ""I resumed the translation of the Scriptures, and continued to labor in this branch of my calling with Elder Sidney Rigdon as my scribe"" (*HC* 1:238-39). On February 16, 1832, he reported a revelation concerning the resurrection of the dead that includes the following reference to his divine commission to translate: ""For while we [Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon] were doing the work of translation, which the Lord had appointed unto us, we came to the twenty-ninth verse of the fifth chapter of John"" (D&C 76:15). On March 8, 1833, he reported the word of the Lord to him as follows: ""And when you have finished the translation of the [Old Testament] prophets, you shall from thenceforth preside over the affairs of the church"" (D&C 90:13). On May 6, 1833, Joseph Smith reported the following revelation: ""It is my will that you should hasten to translate my scriptures"" (D&C 93:53). Although not a complete list, the foregoing items illustrate Joseph Smith's claim to a divine appointment to translate the Old and New Testaments.",2,

Aside from his Book of Mormon translation project, Joseph Smith engaged in at least three other scripture production projects that we know of. The first was his ambitious Bible translation project we now know as the Joseph Smith Translation. The second was the printing of his own revelations, which we now know as the Doctrine and Covenants. And the third was his project of translation which commenced after he acquired Papyrus scrolls from Egypt, which culminated in what we now know as the Book of Abraham. Today begins a new series in which we will consider each of these fascinating projects in turn, including the points of controversy connected with each.

Plural marriage, a form of religious polygamy, or polygyny to be technical, is one of the most controversial and faith-challenging aspects of the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It was difficult when it was first introduced in the early church, and, although it was discontinued over 130 years ago, it is still a difficult issue to reckon with for many, both within and outside of the church. So why was it introduced into the church in the first place? When did Joseph Smith first learn that this practice would be restored? Why did he delay practicing it? How did he and others who were asked to live it initially respond? And what were the four theological reasons given by the Lord in the Doctrine and Covenants to justify the practice of plural marriage? On today's episode of *Church History Matters*, we explore the best sources to answer these and related questions. And while we realize that learning the answers to these questions may not fully remove one's wrestle with this issue, we believe it can sure help. I'm Scott Woodward, a managing director at Scripture Central, and my co-host is Casey Griffiths, also a managing director at Scripture Central. And today Casey and I dive into our first episode in this series dealing with plural marriage. Now, let's get into it.",0,Nyma

He and other RLDS leaders, writers, missionaries, and members fought for decades to project the image of original Latter Day Saintism as nonpolygamous. The public outcry against Utah Latter-day Saints for their polygamous doctrine and practice, however, together with the similarity of the two churches' names, greatly complicated the RLDS effort to mark itself as separate from Utah Mormonism.

Polygamy was the most clear-cut issue that RLDS people used to disassociate themselves from the LDS Church, and to arouse public antipathy against Utah Mormonism. Other issues, however, also placed Utah Mormonism and the RLDS church on opposite sides of an ideological boundary. Some of these stemmed from teachings Joseph Smith, Jr., had put in place in the Nauvoo setting (1839-1844). By the end of the century, the RLDS church was either repudiating them or taking a wait-and-see posture. Rejected were such doctrines as the political kingdom of God, militarism (i.e., military organizations such as the Nauvoo Legion), the Adam-God theory (*see* Young, Brigham: Teachings of Brigham Young*), plural gods, exclusion of blacks from priesthood offices, and absolute theocracy. In the wait-and-see category were the temple and its system of saving rituals for both dead and living (see* Salvation of the Dead*), the book of Abraham, and strictly enforced restrictions on the use of coffee, alcohol, and tobacco (see* Word of Wisdom*).*",1,

President Woodruff consulted with leaders and prayed earnestly to know what to do. After receiving divine revelation, he issued the manifesto on September 24, 1890, announcing an official end to plural marriage. ""The Lord showed me by vision and revelation exactly what would take place if we did not stop this practice,"" President Woodruff later said. ""He has told me exactly what to do, and what the result would be if we did not do it"" (*Deseret Evening News,* Nov. 14, 1891). The Manifesto said that the Church had halted the teaching of plural marriage and was not allowing new plural marriages. President Woodruff said he would submit himself to the laws of the land and urged Church members to do the same. At general conference on October 6, 1890, the Church accepted the Manifesto. It was incorporated into the Doctrine and Covenants in 1908.

Speaking for the First Presidency, George Q. Cannon explained that a revelation from 1841 applied in 1890; it had instructed the Church that when ""enemies come upon them and hinder them from performing that work, behold, it behooveth me to require that work no more at the hands of those&#133;men, but to accept of their offerings"" (D&C 124:49). Most Saints accepted the new direction, but not easily and not all. Indeed, a limited number of new plural marriages occurred in the next decade before Church leaders made it clear that all who persisted in the practice faced excommunication.",3,

Yeah. And that's probably the high point. And like we said, Kathryn Daynes wrote this great book called More Wives Than One, where she just basically took a single community, Manti, Utah, and studied the records that were there. And she showed that the number of plural marriages was always continuously on the decline, and then there'd be a spike when a new law came out or a new effort was made by the government to try and end plural marriage. So the majority of the church never practiced it, and without outside interference, it's interesting to think about what might have happened to it if it was left alone. It's like the saints kept upholding it because of this outside pressure, but in general, they trended towards monogamy. I don't think their society was ever really strategically built to accommodate plural marriage. So they trended towards monogamy in their own life.",2,

In 1862 Congress enacted a law prohibiting polygamy in the territories and disincorporating the Church, but the law went unenforced until after Reynolds V. United States in 1879. Church immigrants continued to arrive by the thousands, and Brigham Young continued planting colonies to house them. The steady influx of non-Mormons to Utah and the construction of a transcontinental railroad, however, pointed toward future challenges to LDS domination of their Great Basin commonwealth.

The completion of the transcontinental railroad brought opportunities as well as challenges. Brigham Young had long anticipated the end of physical isolation and in some ways encouraged it. In 1852 and in 1854, the Saints petitioned Congress for a transcontinental railroad to pass through Utah. Such a railroad would simplify immigration and permit Church leaders to establish rail links connecting many distant colonies with Salt Lake City. When the Pacific Railroad Act was passed on July 1, 1862, President Young subscribed for $10,000 worth of stock in the newly organized Union Pacific Railroad Company, of which he became a director in 1865.

Though the railroad made it easier for Church immigrants to reach Utah, it also encouraged non-Mormon immigration. The end of isolation likewise threatened Utah's economic and political independence. In order to build the local economy and postpone the establishment of a powerful non-Mormon business community, Church officials had long struggled to discourage the importation of eastern manufactured goods. They now launched a determined campaign to discourage the purchase of imported luxuries, including tea, coffee, alcohol, and tobacco, and Joseph Smith's 1833 revelation discouraging the use of these products was given added emphasis (see Word of Wisdom).",1,

Popularly known as polygamy, it was actually polygyny. Although polygamy had been practiced for much of history in many parts of the world, to do so in ""enlightened"" America in the nineteenth century was viewed by most as incomprehensible and unacceptable, making it the Church's most controversial and least understood practice. Though the principle was lived for a relatively brief period, it had profound impact on LDS self-definition, helping to establish the Latter-day Saints as a ""people apart."" The practice also caused many nonmembers to distance themselves from the Church and see Latter-day Saints more negatively than would otherwise have been the case.

Rumors of plural marriage among the members of the Church in the 1830s and 1840s led to persecution, and the public announcement of the practice after August 29, 1852, in Utah gave enemies a potent weapon to fan public hostility against the Church. Although Latter-day Saints believed that their religiously-based practice of plural marriage was protected by the U.S. Constitution, opponents used it to delay Utah statehood until 1896. Ever harsher antipolygamy legislation stripped Latter-day Saints of their rights as citizens, disincorporated the Church, and permitted the seizure of Church property before the manifesto of 1890 announced the discontinuance of the practice.",3,

Briggs left Smith in the fall of 1851 on learning that Smith was also a polygamist.

On November 18, 1851, Briggs sought and received what he felt to be divine revelation regarding the future of the church. His followers distributed copies of the record of Briggs's revelation to nearby branches. The four major thrusts of the document were to denounce other claimants to prophetic authority; to enjoin the elders to preach against false doctrines that had overtaken the church; to instruct the elders to teach the original gospel law as found in the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the Doctrine and Covenants; and to promise that from the lineage of Joseph Smith, Jr., would come the proper leader of the church. Zenas H. Gurley, Sr. (1801-1871), pastor of a church branch at Yellow Stone, Wisconsin, read the Briggs message to his people. Gurley had also rejected the leadership of Brigham Young, James Strang, and William Smith at about the same time as Briggs, his new ally.

Another example of revelation received but not published is the revelation underlying the announcement by the First Presidency in June 1978 extending the priesthood to all worthy male members of the Church. Only an official statement concerning that revelation was published (see Doctrine and Covenants: Official Declaration 2). Other changes in the Church, such as the recent expanding of the role of the seventy, accelerating temple building, and expanding missionary activity, are viewed by Latter-day Saints as manifestations of divine direction. The revealed basis of these changes is not always published, as it more often was in the early years of the Church. As Elder James E.

And there's disunity among the Twelve, in many regards, to this issue with blacks, some about the Civil Rights movement itself, and certainly about the policy barring blacks from priesthood and temple privileges. So we compared and contrasted, for instance, Hugh B. Brown, who was very pro-Civil-Rights-movement, with Ezra Taft Benson, who felt like this was maybe a communist ploy to try to infiltrate America. Hugh B. Brown thought that the priesthood ban was simply a policy that could be changed by vote, and so he actually put it to the Twelve to have them vote, and then Harold B. Lee really pushed strongly back against that. He wasn't in the meeting. When he found out about it, he pushed back and said, ""Listen, this is a doctrine. This is not a policy. This is a doctrine from the beginning. You can't just vote on it. This would take a revelation from heaven."" And so we have this—different apostles seeing this differently, not seeing eye to eye. And so when President Kimball becomes president—I think we ended our last episode with him becoming president in 1973, that at the beginning of his presidency he wrote to his son Edward, saying, ""Revelations will probably never come unless they're desired."" You've got to want the revelation. And he said, ""I believe most revelations will come when a man is on his tiptoes, reaching as high as he can for something which he knows he needs, and then there bursts upon him the answer to his problems."" So today we want to talk about that. What does President Kimball do to begin reaching for a revelation, which we know comes on June 1, 1978, at least to the whole First Presidency and Twelve.

However, when one looks at the Book of Mormon in its ancient context, this lack of references to women begins to make more sense.

In the Old Testament, for example, around 200 named women are mentioned and more than twice that number of unnamed women are referred to, but that is still a very small number when compared to the number of men named in the book (nearly 3,000).4, 75."") In addition, this number drops significantly when one considers the books in the Old Testament written during the time of Lehi and later.5 Thus, the lack of women in the Book of Mormon fits its ancient Israelite context. In addition, the Book of Mormon does not contain the kinds of texts, like law books or social histories, that discuss women more often, like the Old Testament does. This means that women appear in the Nephite record even less often than one might otherwise expect.6

Literacy is another factor we must take into account. Unlike many modern Western societies, where both men and women are literate, in the ancient Near East and pre-Columbian America, it was primarily men who were literate.10 This means not only that a man (Mormon) abridged the Book of Mormon, but also that men wrote the records that Mormon abridged.

Eve is mentioned in the context of an explication of the doctrine of the Fall of Adam as the precursor of the salvation of mankind. Sarah is recognized as the faithful mother of nations. Mary is called ""a virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins"" (1 Ne. 11:15).

Other women are known in the Book of Mormon only by their individual deeds: the wife of Nephi 1 a daughter of Ishmael, tried to soften wicked hearts with her tears (1 Ne. 7:19;18:19); Ishmael's wife and three of their daughters supported Nephi (1 Ne. 7:6); a maidservant fled from Morianton's camp, after being severely beaten by him, to warn Moroni 1 of the plans of her rebel master (Alma 50:30-31); a daughter of Jared originated a plot to regain the kingdom for her father through enticement, violence, and deceit (Ether 8-9); two Lamanite queens were converted by the sons of Mosiah 2 (Alma 19:29-30;22:19-24). Perhaps, as in some Semitic cultures today, the formal or more polite way of referring to a woman was not by her given name, but by describing her position in the family, such as ""the daughter of Jared."" Others so designated include Ishmael's wife, Ishmael's daughters, Ishmael's eldest daughter and wife of Zoram, Lehi's daughters and Nephi's sisters, Lamoni's daughter; and Coriantumr's unrepentant daughters.",3,

Women have also played important roles in the LDS Church in our own gospel dispensation. To acknowledge and appreciate this influence, the Church Historian's Press recently selected and published a collection of discourses given by LDS women from 1831 to 2016.4 Not only do these talks show the vital contribution women have made to the Church and its people, but they also highlight how LDS women have promoted, defended, and utilized the Book of Mormon.

Rachel H. Leatham, for example, was ""among the first generation of unmarried women to serve proselytizing missions for the church.""5 When asked to report on her mission at an overflow meeting during the April session of general conference in 1908, she emphasized the importance of the Book of Mormon. She asked the youth,

Six women are mentioned by name: Sariah, Isabel, Abish, Eve, Sarah, and Mary. Since no women are mentioned as religious or military leaders and only a few as political leaders, it appears that males held virtually all leadership positions in this society. Also, since the Book of Mormon was written primarily to remind future readers of the goodness of God and to persuade them to believe in Christ, it contains no law books and little intellectual or social history discussing the meshing of familial and religious practices. It is reasonable to assume, however, that these people began with many customs similar to their ancestral Semitic cultures and that their practices changed somewhat over the years.

In Nephite society, marriage and childbearing were expected, carrying religious significance and responsibilities (1 Ne. 7:1; Mosiah 4:14-15; 4 Ne. 1:11). Marriages may have been arranged within ethnic groups (1 Ne. 16:7; Alma 17:24) and were restricted outside certain groups (Alma 3:8). Polygamy and concubinage were prohibited and scorned; monogamy was expected, except as the Lord might command otherwise to ""raise up seed"" unto himself (Jacob 2:27-30).

Husbands and wives were expected to be faithful and loyal to each other (Jacob 3:7). One case shows that a wife was valued, even if unable to conceive. The righteous Jaredite king Coriantum remained with his barren wife until her death at age 102. He then married a young maid and fathered sons and daughters (Ether 9:23-24). It was, likewise, a sign of great wickedness that the priests of king Noah deserted their families. While in hiding, they abducted twenty-four Lamanite women for wives. When Lamanite kinsmen discovered and sought to kill the priests several years later, however, these women faithfully pleaded for the lives of their husbands (Mosiah 23:33).",3,

For example, Christ compares his gathering of the repentant to a mother hen gathering her chicks under her wing. As in Proverbs 3:13-20,wisdom is female (Mosiah 8:20), as is mercy (Alma 42:24). Sometimes female imagery is applied to the Lord, as when the mother nursing her child is the image used of the Lord comforting and remembering his covenant children (1 Ne. 21:15).

In a sense, the woman is the image of God's people. The biblical imagery of God as husband and his people as wife is continued in the Book of Mormon, mostly from the writings of Isaiah. Decadent Israel is described as devoid of honorable men, in that they valued women as decorative sex objects (2 Ne. 13:16-26; Isa. 3:16-26). When God's people become unfaithful to him, they are called ""the whore of all the earth"" (2 Ne. 10:16). When he calls his people to repentance, the Lord asks rhetorically, ""Have I put thee away?&#133;Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement?"" (2 Ne. 7:1; Isa. 50:1). The images of a mother too weak to nurse her child and a pregnant woman so near term she is unable to flee destruction are used to motivate the Nephites to repent (Hel. 15:1-2); the woman whose children are lost is the image of desolation (1 Ne. 21:20-21). Those who accept ""marriage"" with the Lord are to experience joy as abundant as that of a barren woman who becomes a mother of many children, and the Lord consoles his people by saying, ""For thy maker, thy husband, the Lord of Hosts is his name; &#133;For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee"" (3 Ne. 22:1, 5-8; Isa. 54:1, 5-8).",0,

Nephi and his brothers measure the difficulty of their travels in terms of the suffering of their wives, though Nephi emphasizes that the women were made strong like the men, while his brothers describe their wives' sufferings as being worse than death (1 Ne. 17:1, 20). Jacob sharply contrasts male infidelity with the tenderness of the women (Jacob 2-3); immorality is described as precipitating the collapse of both family and society. The inhumanity and depravity of dying civilizations are also described in terms of the suffering of women: Lamanites fed to women and children the flesh of their dead husbands and fathers (Moro. 9:8); Nephite women were sacrificed to idols (Morm. 4:15, 21); Nephites raped captured Lamanite women, tortured them to death, and then ate their flesh as a token of their bravery (Moro. 9:9-10).",0,

We feel accountable to God for our choices and our lives. We take upon us the name of Christ. We are focused on Christ—on being valiant in the testimony of Jesus and on developing the character of Christ.

With covenants, obedience to gospel principles becomes rooted in our very soul. I am familiar with a couple where, at the time of their marriage, the wife was not active in the Church and the husband had never been a member of the Church. I will refer to them as Mary and John, not their real names. As children began to enter the picture, Mary felt keenly the need to raise them, as the scripture says, ""in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.""7 John was supportive. Mary made some important sacrifices to be at home to teach the gospel on a consistent basis. She ensured that the family took full advantage of Church worship and activity. Mary and John became exemplary parents, and their children (all energetic boys) grew in faith and devotion to gospel principles and standards.

John's parents, the boys' grandparents, were pleased with the wholesome lives and achievements of their grandsons, but because of some antagonism toward the Church, they wanted to attribute this success exclusively to the parenting skills of John and Mary. John, although not a member of the Church, did not let that assessment go unchallenged. He insisted that they were witnessing the fruits of gospel teachings—what his sons were experiencing in church as well as what was happening at home.

John himself was being influenced by the Spirit, by the love and example of his wife, and by the urgings of his sons. In due course, he was baptized, much to the joy of ward members and friends.",0,

This leads us to consideration of a third special blessing of the covenant path. God provides an almost incomprehensible gift to help covenant-makers be covenant-keepers: the gift of the Holy Ghost. This gift is the right to the constant companionship, protection, and guidance of the Holy Spirit.12 Also known as the Comforter, the Holy Spirit ""filleth with hope and perfect love.""13 He ""knoweth all things, and beareth record of the Father and of the Son,""14 whose witnesses we commit to be.15

On the covenant path we also find the essential blessings of forgiveness and cleansing from sin. This is help that can come only through divine grace, administered by the Holy Ghost. ""Now this is the commandment,"" says the Lord, ""Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.""16",0,

First is the nature of our obedience to God. More than simply having good intentions, we solemnly commit to live by every word that proceeds forth from the mouth of God.

""… The ordinances of the temple and the covenants you make there are key to strengthening your life, your marriage and family, and your ability to resist the attacks of the adversary. Your worship in the temple and your service there for your ancestors will bless you with increased personal revelation and peace and will fortify your commitment to stay on the covenant path.""1

What is the covenant path? It is the one path that leads to the celestial kingdom of God. We embark upon the path at the gate of baptism and then ""press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men [the two great commandments] … to the end.""2 In the course of the covenant path (which, by the way, extends beyond mortality), we receive all the ordinances and covenants pertaining to salvation and exaltation.",2,

God's prophet, President Russell M. Nelson, admonished us in his January 16, 2018, telecast to ""keep on the covenant path. Your commitment to follow the Savior by making covenants with Him and then keeping those covenants will open the door to every spiritual blessing and privilege available to men, women, and children everywhere. … The end for which each of us strives is to be endowed with power in a house of the Lord, sealed as families, faithful to covenants made in a temple that qualify us for the greatest gift of God—that of eternal life"" (""As We Go Forward Together,"" Ensign or Liahona, Apr. 2018, 7).

God will not abandon His relationship with, or withhold His promised blessings of eternal life from, any faithful covenant keeper. And as we honor sacred covenants, we are drawn closer to the Savior. Elder David A. Bednar taught us yesterday that gospel covenants and ordinances operate in our lives like a compass to give us cardinal direction to come unto Christ and become more like Him.

Covenants mark the path back to God. The ordinances of baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, priesthood ordination, and the sacrament lead us to the Lord's temple to partake of His ordinances of exaltation.",1,

Finally, it is only in pursuing the covenant path that we inherit the blessings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the ultimate blessings of salvation and exaltation that only God can give.23

Scriptural references to the covenant people often mean literal descendants of Abraham or the ""house of Israel."" But the covenant people also include all who receive the gospel of Jesus Christ.24 Paul explained:

""For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. …

""And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.""25

Those who are loyal to their covenants ""shall come forth in the resurrection of the just.""26 They are ""made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant. … These are they whose bodies are celestial, whose glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God, the highest of all.""27 ""Wherefore, all things are theirs, whether life or death, or things present, or things to come, all are theirs and they are Christ's, and Christ is God's.""28

Let us heed the prophet's call to stay on the covenant path. Nephi saw us and our time and recorded, ""I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.""29

Some might say, ""I can make good choices with or without baptism; I don't need covenants to be an honorable and successful person."" Indeed, there are many who, while not on the covenant path themselves, act in a way that mirrors the choices and contributions of those who are on the path.

Unforced errors are considered the result of a player's blunder rather than being caused by the opponent's skill.

Too often our problems or challenges are self-inflicted, the result of poor choices, or, we could say, the result of ""unforced errors.""

2. The Savior instituted the ordinance of the sacrament that we may always remember Him and have His Spirit to be with us. Baptism opens the gate to eternal life, and the sacrament helps us to steadfastly press forward along the covenant path. As we take the sacrament, it shall be a testimony unto the Father that we do always remember His Son. And as we always remember Him and keep His commandments, we shall have His Spirit to be with us. Added to this promise, the Lord renews the promised remission of sin as we humbly repent of our sins.

In staying faithful to our covenants, we should endeavor to always have the Spirit to prepare us to worthily partake of the sacrament, and likewise, we regularly partake of the sacrament to always have the Spirit with us.",1,

Based on eternal, unchanging law, He specified the nonnegotiable conditions whereby we are transformed, saved, and exalted. In this life, we make these covenants by participating in priesthood ordinances and promising to do what God asks us to do, and in return, God promises us certain blessings.6

A covenant is a pledge that we should prepare for, clearly understand, and absolutely honor.7 Making a covenant with God is different than casually making a promise. First, priesthood authority is required. Second, a feeble promise does not have the connecting strength to lift us above the pull of the natural flow. We make a covenant only when we intend to commit ourselves quite exceptionally to fulfilling it.8 We become covenant children of God and inheritors of His kingdom, especially when we identify ourselves completely with the covenant.

The term *covenant path* refers to a series of covenants whereby we come to Christ and connect to Him. Through this covenant bond, we have access to His eternal power. The path begins with faith in Jesus Christ and repentance, followed by baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost.9 Jesus Christ showed us how to enter the path when He was baptized.10 According to the New Testament Gospel accounts in Mark and Luke, Heavenly Father spoke directly to Jesus at His baptism, saying, ""Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased."" When we embark on the covenant path through baptism, I can imagine Heavenly Father saying a similar thing to each of us: ""Thou art my dear child in whom I delight. Keep going.""11",2,

Perhaps you hear those words and think of checkboxes. Maybe all you see is a path of requirements. A closer look reveals something more compelling. A covenant is not only about a contract, although that is important. It's about a relationship. President Russell M. Nelson taught, ""The covenant path is all about our relationship with God.""9

Consider a marriage covenant. The wedding date is important, but equally important is the relationship forged through the life lived together afterward. The same is true with a covenant relationship with God. Conditions have been set, and there will be expectations along the way. And yet He invites each of us to come as we are able, with full purpose of heart, and to ""press forward""10 with Him at our side, trusting that His promised blessings will come. Scripture reminds us that often those blessings come in His own time and in His own way: 38 years,11 12 years,12 immediately.13 As your trail will demand, so His succor will be.14

His is a mission of condescension. Jesus Christ will meet us where we are as we are. This is the *why* of the garden, the cross, and the tomb. The Savior was sent to help us overcome.15 But staying where we are won't bring the deliverance we seek. Just as He didn't leave Jacob there in the dirt, the Lord doesn't intend to leave any of us where we are.

His is also a mission of ascension. He will work within us16 to lift us up to where He is and, in the process, enable us to become as He is. Jesus Christ came to lift us.17 He wants to help us become. This is the *why* of the temple.

We must remember: it's not the course alone that will exalt us; it's the companion—our Savior. And *this* is the why of covenant relationship.",3,

In legal language, a covenant generally denotes an agreement between two or more parties. But in a religious context, a covenant is much more significant. It is a sacred promise with God. He fixes the terms. Each person may choose to accept those terms. If one accepts the terms of the covenant and obeys God's law, he or she receives the blessings associated with the covenant. We know that ""when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.""4

Through the ages, God has made covenants with His children.5 His covenants occur throughout the entire plan of salvation and are therefore part of the fulness of His gospel.6 For example, God promised to send a Savior for His children,7 asking in turn for their obedience to His law.8

In the Bible we read of men and women in the Old World who were identified as children of the covenant. What covenant? ""The covenant which God made with [their] fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.""9

In the Book of Mormon we read of people in the New World who were also identified as children of the covenant.10 The resurrected Lord so informed them: ""Behold, ye are the children of the prophets; and ye are of the house of Israel; and ye are of the covenant which the Father made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.""11

The Savior explained the importance of their identity as children of the covenant. He said, ""The Father having raised me up unto you first, … sent me to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities; and this because ye are the children of the covenant.""12",3,

We come unto Christ by ""exercising faith in [Him], repenting daily, making covenants with God as we receive the ordinances of salvation and exaltation, and enduring to the end by keeping those covenants"" (General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1.2.1, ChurchofJesusChrist.org). The path to perfection is the covenant path, and Jesus Christ is the center of all ordinances and covenants.

King Benjamin taught that because of the covenants we make, we become sons and daughters of Christ, who has spiritually begotten us, and under His head are we made free, for ""there is no other name given whereby salvation cometh"" (see Mosiah 5:7–8). We are saved as we endure to the end by ""following the example of the Son of the living God"" (2 Nephi 31:16). Nephi counseled that all is not done by merely getting into the strait and narrow path; we ""must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men"" (see 2 Nephi 31:19–20).",2,

A second unique aspect of the covenant path is our relationship with Deity. The covenants God offers to His children do more than guide us. They bind us to Him, and, bound to Him, we can overcome all things.9

I once read an article by a poorly informed newspaper reporter who explained that the way we perform baptisms for the dead is to immerse rolls of microfilm in water. Then all those whose names appear on the microfilm are considered baptized. That approach would be efficient, but it ignores the infinite worth of each soul and the critical importance of a personal covenant with God.

""[Jesus] said … : Enter ye in at the strait gate; for strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it.""10 Figuratively speaking, this gate is so narrow that it allows only one to enter at a time. Each one makes an individual commitment to God and in return receives from Him a personal covenant, by name, that he or she can rely on implicitly in time and eternity. With the ordinances and covenants, ""the power of godliness is manifest"" in our lives.11",1,

The lyrics go something like this:

When Christmas morning gleams

I want to go to the stable,

Where God in the nighttime hours

Already rests upon the straw.

How good Thou wast to desire

To come down to the earth!

Now, I do not wish to waste

My childhood days in sin anymore!

Jesus, we need Thee,

Thou dear children's friend.

I no longer wish to grieve Thee

With my sins again.10

When we figuratively transport ourselves to the Bethlehem stable, ""where God in the nighttime hours already rests upon the straw,"" we can recognize better the Savior as a gift from a kind, loving Heavenly Father. Rather than feeling entitled to His blessings and grace, we develop an intense desire to stop causing God further grief.

Whatever our current direction or distance to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, we can choose to turn toward Them and draw closer to Them. They will help us. As the Savior told the Nephites following His Resurrection:

""And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, …

""And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me.""11

To draw closer to the Savior, we must increase our faith in Him, make and keep covenants, and have the Holy Ghost with us. We must also act in faith, responding to the spiritual direction we receive. All of these elements come together in the sacrament. Indeed, the best way I know of to draw closer to God is to prepare conscientiously and partake worthily of the sacrament each week.",1,

We realize that as evil increases in the world, our spiritual survival, and the spiritual survival of those we love, will require that we more fully nurture, fortify, and strengthen the roots of our faith in Jesus Christ. The Apostle Paul counseled us to be rooted,9 grounded, and settled10 in our love for the Savior and our determination to follow Him. Today and the days ahead require more focused and concentrated effort, guarding against diversions and carelessness.11

But even with the increasing worldly influences around us, we need not fear. The Lord will never desert His covenant people. There is a compensatory power of spiritual gifts and divine direction for the righteous.12 This added blessing of spiritual power, however, does not settle upon us just because we are part of this generation. It comes as we strengthen our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and keep His commandments, as we come to know Him and love Him. ""This is life eternal,"" Jesus prayed, ""that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.""13

As we know very well, having faith in Jesus Christ and being a true disciple is more than a one-time decision—more than a one-time event. It is a sacred, ongoing process that grows and expands through the seasons of our lives, continuing until we kneel at His feet.

With the wheat growing amidst the tares in the world, how can we deepen and strengthen our commitment to the Savior in the days ahead?

We begin by learning about Him.5 ""It is impossible for [us] to be saved in ignorance.""6 The more we know about the Savior's ministry and mission7—the more we understand His doctrine8 and what He did for us—the more we know that He can provide the power that we need for our lives.",2,

My God hath been my support"" (2 Ne. 4:19–20).

We remember Alma's counsel: ""Let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever. Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings"" (Alma 37:36–37).

Nephi said, the Lord ""hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh"" (2 Ne. 4:21). Those who are consumed in Christ ""are made alive in Christ"" (2 Ne. 25:25). They ""suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ"" (Alma 31:38). They are ""clasped in the arms of Jesus"" (Morm. 5:11). Nephi said, ""I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul"" (2 Ne. 33:6). Lehi said, ""I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his love"" (2 Ne. 1:15).

Now, my beloved brethren and sisters, let us read the Book of Mormon and be convinced that Jesus is the Christ. Let us continually reread the Book of Mormon so that we might more fully come to Christ, be committed to Him, centered in Him, and consumed in Him.

If you want to stay close to someone who has been dear to you, but from whom you are separated, you know how to do it. You would find a way to speak to them, you would listen to them, and you would discover ways to do things for each other.

As we are faithful to the promises we have made, we will feel our love for Him. It will increase because we will feel His power and His drawing near to us in His service.

President Thomas S. Monson has reminded us often of the promise of the Lord to His faithful disciples: ""And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.""12

There is another way you and I have felt Him grow closer to us. As we give devoted service to Him, He draws closer to those we love in our families. Every time I have been called in the Lord's service to move or to leave my family, I have come to see that the Lord was blessing my wife and my children. He prepared loving servants of His and opportunities to draw my family closer to Him.

You have felt that same blessing in your lives. Many of you have loved ones who are wandering off the path to eternal life. You wonder what more you can do to bring them back. You can depend on the Lord to draw closer to them as you serve Him in faith.

You remember the Lord's promise to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon when they were away from their families on His errands: ""My friends Sidney and Joseph, your families are well; they are in mine hands, and I will do with them as seemeth me good; for in me there is all power.""13",2,

To members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Book of Mormon forms the doctrinal foundation of the Church and speaks the word of God to all the world.

The Book of Mormon both confirms and supplements the Bible: ""Behold, this [the Book of Mormon] is written for the intent that ye may believe that [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe [the Book of Mormon] also"" (Morm. 7:9). The Bible is primarily a record of God's dealings with the forebears and descendants of Jacob or Israel in the ancient Near East. Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of God's dealings principally with another group of Israelites he brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem about 600 B.C. (see Lehi). They anticipated the birth and coming of Jesus Christ and believed in his Atonement and gospel. Their complex, lengthy records were abridged by a prophet named Mormon, inscribed on plates of gold, and buried by his son, Moroni 2, after internecine wars destroyed all of the believers in Christ in the New World except Moroni (A.D. 385).",3,Elsie

(History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 4:461.)

We believe the Bible to be the word of God, but I have often asked missionaries what they would do without the Book of Mormon and modern revelation. With just the Bible, what would be their approach? The Prophet Joseph answered it. ""Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations and where is our religion? We have none."" (HC, 2:52.)

If the Book of Mormon is not true, then Joseph Smith was not a prophet of God. I testify to you that the Book of Mormon is true and that the revelations contained in the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price and other places are true and of the Lord. Our message to the world is that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that God has revealed himself to man in this dispensation and restored his gospel with all its keys and power. Nothing will be more certain to build faith and testimonies of members and touch the hearts of honest seekers for the truth than this great book.

There is a special power about the Book of Mormon. It bears a strong, silent witness of its truth as one reads it.

Parley P. Pratt stated, ""The Spirit of the Lord came upon me, while I read [The Book of Mormon], and enlightened my mind, convinced my judgment, and rivetted the truth upon my understanding, so that I knew that the book was true, just as well as a man knows the daylight from the dark night."" (Journal of Discourses, 5:194.)

Brigham Young said as he read the book, ""I knew it was true, as well as I knew that I could see with my eyes, or feel by the touch of my fingers, or be sensible of the demonstration of any sense."" (JD, 3:91.)",3,

He said, ""I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book"" (*History of the Church,* 4:461). That is the third reason for studying the book. It helps us draw nearer to God. Is there not something deep in our hearts that longs to draw nearer to God, to be more like Him in our daily walk, to feel His presence with us constantly? If so, then the Book of Mormon will help us do so more than any other book.

It is not just that the Book of Mormon teaches us truth, though it indeed does that. It is not just that the Book of Mormon bears testimony of Christ, though it indeed does that, too. But there is something more. There is a power in the book which will begin to flow into your lives the moment you begin a serious study of the book. You will find greater power to resist temptation. You will find the power to avoid deception. You will find the power to stay on the strait and narrow path. The scriptures are called ""the words of life"" (D&C 84:85), and nowhere is that more true than it is of the Book of Mormon. When you begin to hunger and thirst after those words, you will find life in greater and greater abundance.",3,

Many have wondered how this could be if there were possible mistakes made in the book's textual history. Latter-day Saint scholar Hugh Nibley answered this question by distinguishing between the message of the Book of Mormon and the ""mechanical details"" of its printing:

If the Book of Mormon is the ""most correct"" book, that means that all other books, to one extent or another, are less correct, and therefore contain a degree of error. But it also a clear admission that the Book of Mormon itself also contains error. Joseph Smith does not state that the Book of Mormon is ""entirely correct,"" or ""always correct,"" or ""the perfectly correct book."" He is offering a comparison rather than issuing an ultimatum.

If the Bible and other books were only, say, 2% correct, and the Book of Mormon were 3% correct, it would still be ""the most correct"" under those circumstances, even if 97% of it were incorrect. (I personally don't think the Bible is only 2% correct or that the Book of Mormon is only 3% correct; I'm pushing this to an extreme to illustrate the point.) The comparison highlights the fact that, while no religious texts are perfect, the Book of Mormon is the best
It's also necessary to define what Joseph Smith, and those who quote him, actually mean when they say the Book of Mormon is ""correct"" in any respect – least, most, or otherwise. How comprehensively should we interpret that adjective? Is it more correct than, say, Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" on the subject of black holes? No, the Book of Mormon doesn't even mention black holes, so Hawking's book is demonstrably more scientifically correct than the Book of Mormon. Okay, then is the Book of Mormon the most grammatically correct of any book on earth? It clearly isn't, although I don't know what book would be.

While the Ephesian Saints were no stranger to persecution from the Greco-Roman world (see Acts 19:24–41), of much greater concern to Paul was that the Ephesian Saints remain loyal to the Lord and their covenants. Moreover, much of Paul's epistles were written in part to correct false beliefs and attitudes that were arising in the various churches, just as he had foretold.5

Shortly before he was executed under Nero's command, Paul warned Timothy that the prophesied rebellion was then at hand, as many churches Paul established had forsaken him and the gospel: ""All they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes"" (2 Timothy 1:15). This rebellion even reached some of Paul's most trusted missionary companions: ""Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.

As early as the events recorded in the sixth chapter of John, this falling away took place. You will recall from reading that chapter in the New Testament that many of his disciples would not accept his pure doctrine and therefore fell away and no longer followed him.

In apparent dismay, Jesus turned to the Twelve and asked, ""Will ye also go away?""

Then it was that Simon Peter replied, ""Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.""

Note if you will that the words of eternal life were *not* with those who fell away, but rather with those who remained faithful and loyal.

Subsequently, during the administration of the Twelve, serious apostasy developed again. As a result, nearly all of the epistles of the New Testament were written to combat it.

While this may appear to be a bold claim, closer review of the New Testament shows that the Apostles knew of the forthcoming Apostasy and warned the Church extensively against the false teachers that would come in its wake.

The word *apostasy* comes from the Greek word *apostasia*, which literally means ""rebellion"" and in the New Testament connotes a people rebelling from God.1, 133–134."") However, the meaning of this word is unfortunately often masked in translations into English. For example, the King James Version of 2 Thessalonians 2:3 translates *apostasia* as ""falling away"": ""Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.""2 While not always clear in translations of the Bible, the connotation of *apostasy* as a rebellion against God is clearly described in the Book of Mormon (see 3 Nephi 6:18; 4 Nephi 1:38).

Noel B. Reynolds has noted that in light of the evidence from the New Testament and based on the meaning of *apostasy* as ""rebellion,"" it is a myth that ""the apostasy happened because of outside persecution.""3 Rather, the New Testament consistently describes the forthcoming Apostasy as an internal rebellion by members of the early Church against God and His chosen leaders—a rebellion that became more and more prominent as the Apostles wrote earnestly in hopes that the congregations might repent.4",3,

They believe that God is a spirit and that the Godhead is only one God. In our view, these concepts are evidence of the falling away we call the Great Apostasy.

We maintain that the concepts identified by such nonscriptural terms as ""the incomprehensible mystery of God"" and ""the mystery of the Holy Trinity"" are attributable to the ideas of Greek philosophy. These philosophical concepts transformed Christianity in the first few centuries following the deaths of the Apostles. For example, philosophers then maintained that physical matter was evil and that God was a spirit without feelings or passions. Persons of this persuasion, including learned men who became influential converts to Christianity, had a hard time accepting the simple teachings of early Christianity: an Only Begotten Son who said he was in the express image of his Father in Heaven and who taught his followers to be one as he and his Father were one, and a Messiah who died on a cross and later appeared to his followers as a resurrected being with flesh and bones.

The collision between the speculative world of Greek philosophy and the simple, literal faith and practice of the earliest Christians produced sharp contentions that threatened to widen political divisions in the fragmenting Roman empire. This led Emperor Constantine to convene the first churchwide council in a.d. 325. The action of this council of Nicaea remains the most important single event after the death of the Apostles in formulating the modern Christian concept of deity. The Nicene Creed erased the idea of the separate being of Father and Son by defining God the Son as being of ""one substance with the Father.""",1,

Talmage also chronicled the persecution of early Christians that hastened the Apostasy and described the primitive Church as changing internally in several respects. He argued that the simple principles of the gospel were mixed with the pagan philosophical systems of the day (Trinitarianism, resulting in the Nicene Creed; false opposition of body and spirit, creating excessive asceticism); that rituals were changed and added to in unauthorized ways (simple early Christian rites were replaced by complex pagan-influenced ceremonies; baptism by immersion was lost; the baptism of infants was introduced cf. [Moro. 8]; communion was changed); and that church organization was altered (the apostles and prophets, the necessary foundation of the church of Christ, were martyred, leaving a void that could not be filled by bishops; thus the medieval church showed little similarity to the organization or practices of the New Testament church).",3,

As Peter told the Saints in Jerusalem, ""the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began,"" would come (Acts 3:21). This restitution of all things was begun by God the Father and Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith.

As Faulconer explained, ""We cannot understand what apostasy means for New Testament Christians without understanding that it included the loss of the temple and, so, of the priesthood, for ultimately the rebellion of apostasy involves severing one's covenant relation to God, a relation manifest through the priesthood, through standing in the presence of God.""10 A serious part of the Restoration entailed restoring covenants and temples, thereby providing a corrective course to this rebellion that corrupted many early Christian doctrines and beliefs. Covenants are essential to the gospel of Jesus Christ, and they allow us to grow closer to our Savior and become more like Him.",1,

The consequences persist in the various creeds of Christianity, which declare a Godhead of only one being and which describe that single being or God as ""incomprehensible"" and ""without body, parts, or passions."" One of the distinguishing features of the doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is its rejection of all of these postbiblical creeds (see Stephen E. Robinson, *Are Mormons Christians?* Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1991; *Encyclopedia of Mormonism,* ed. Daniel H. Ludlow, 4 vols., New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1992, s.v.

In the process of what we call the Apostasy, the tangible, personal God described in the Old and New Testaments was replaced by the abstract, incomprehensible deity defined by compromise with the speculative principles of Greek philosophy. The received language of the Bible remained, but the so-called ""hidden meanings"" of scriptural words were now explained in the vocabulary of a philosophy alien to their origins. In the language of that philosophy, God the Father ceased to be a Father in any but an allegorical sense. He ceased to exist as a comprehensible and compassionate being. And the separate identity of his Only Begotten Son was swallowed up in a philosophical abstraction that attempted to define a common substance and an incomprehensible relationship.",0,

In 1833, referring to Mark 16:17-18 and 1Corinthians 12, Joseph Smith stated: ""By the foregoing testimonies we may look at the Christian world and see [that] the apostasy there has been from the apostolic platform"" (*TPJS*, p. 15). Oliver Cowdery wrote on the apostasy in the first issue of the messenger and advocate (1834). In 1840 Orson Pratt spoke of ""a general and awful apostasy from the religion of the New Testament"" (*Listen to the Voice of Truth*, 1.1). He particularly emphasized a lack of binding ordinances because of the absence of priesthood authority; baptism was a key example. In Pratt's view all churches before the Restoration were wrong in some ways, doctrinally and ritually, even though they might be right in others. Benjamin Winchester, an early LDS pamphleteer, wrote an extensive treatise using New Testament sources to demonstrate that an apostasy had been prophesied (*A History of Priesthood*, Philadelphia, 1843, pp. 72-96). In the 1850s and 1860s many references were made to ""the great apostasy"" (O. Pratt, *JD* 12:247) and ""the great falling away"" (W. Woodruff, *JD* 8:262) in Latter-day Saint sermons.

This idea-breaking off from established religion because it seems out of tune with New Testament Christianity-has obvious Protestant overtones, but the LDS view differs from typical Protestant attitudes in its emphasis on the loss and restoration of exclusive, clear-cut priesthood authority, correct ordinances, and continuing revelation. In contrast, Protestants typically rely primarily on biblical reinterpretation.",1,

The very idea of a centralized Christianity has given way to a picture of diverse and fragmented early Christianity, where it is hard to determine what is orthodox and what is heretical, what is Gnostic and what is ""mainstream."" For instance, Peter Brown and William Phipps argue that Augustine's influential doctrine of original sin, with its concomitant ritual, infant baptism, was derived from his Gnostic background and was, in reality, heretical, while Pelagius' opposition to these ideas was orthodox. But Augustine's doctrines prevailed, and continue to influence Western theology and culture. Another early Christian doctrine that did not survive in Western Christianity was deification, though it remained central to Eastern Christianity.

A complex religious and cultural milieu both nurtured and transformed early Christianity. Many factors must be taken into consideration in analyzing this transformation of Christianity. For example, some have put the blame exclusively on Greek philosophy and the influence of philosophy on Gnosticism for the rise of the great apostasy. But asceticism (i.e., hatred of the body, of sexuality, of the physical world) played a major role in the apostasy of the early church, and extreme asceticism is characteristically Oriental. Moreover, much of Greek philosophy has been found to be consistent with the gospel; Elder Orson F. Whitney referred to Plato and Socrates as ""servants of the Lord,"" although in a ""lesser sense"" than the prophets (*CR* [April 1921]:33).",0,

To be faithful is to keep covenant; to apostatize is to break covenant.""8 Furthermore, in the Greek Septuagint the word *apostasia* is used to describe idolatry and forsaking the Lord. Similarly, the same word is used to describe divorce, especially when marriage was used as a metaphor for God's covenant with Israel. Early Christian texts similarly describe the Apostasy as a corruption of priesthood leaders and a rejection of ordinances and covenants.9 As such, apostasy marks the loss of covenants and priesthood authority that can be restored only through a prophet of God.",2,

As Peter told the Saints in Jerusalem, ""the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began,"" would come (Acts 3:21). This restitution of all things was begun by God the Father and Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith.

As Faulconer explained, ""We cannot understand what apostasy means for New Testament Christians without understanding that it included the loss of the temple and, so, of the priesthood, for ultimately the rebellion of apostasy involves severing one's covenant relation to God, a relation manifest through the priesthood, through standing in the presence of God.""10 A serious part of the Restoration entailed restoring covenants and temples, thereby providing a corrective course to this rebellion that corrupted many early Christian doctrines and beliefs. Covenants are essential to the gospel of Jesus Christ, and they allow us to grow closer to our Savior and become more like Him.",2,

As early as the events recorded in the sixth chapter of John, this falling away took place. You will recall from reading that chapter in the New Testament that many of his disciples would not accept his pure doctrine and therefore fell away and no longer followed him.

In apparent dismay, Jesus turned to the Twelve and asked, ""Will ye also go away?""

Then it was that Simon Peter replied, ""Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.""

Note if you will that the words of eternal life were *not* with those who fell away, but rather with those who remained faithful and loyal.

Subsequently, during the administration of the Twelve, serious apostasy developed again. As a result, nearly all of the epistles of the New Testament were written to combat it.

While this may appear to be a bold claim, closer review of the New Testament shows that the Apostles knew of the forthcoming Apostasy and warned the Church extensively against the false teachers that would come in its wake.

The word *apostasy* comes from the Greek word *apostasia*, which literally means ""rebellion"" and in the New Testament connotes a people rebelling from God.1, 133–134."") However, the meaning of this word is unfortunately often masked in translations into English. For example, the King James Version of 2 Thessalonians 2:3 translates *apostasia* as ""falling away"": ""Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.""2 While not always clear in translations of the Bible, the connotation of *apostasy* as a rebellion against God is clearly described in the Book of Mormon (see 3 Nephi 6:18; 4 Nephi 1:38).

Noel B. Reynolds has noted that in light of the evidence from the New Testament and based on the meaning of *apostasy* as ""rebellion,"" it is a myth that ""the apostasy happened because of outside persecution.""3 Rather, the New Testament consistently describes the forthcoming Apostasy as an internal rebellion by members of the early Church against God and His chosen leaders—a rebellion that became more and more prominent as the Apostles wrote earnestly in hopes that the congregations might repent.4",3,

Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them"" (Acts 20:29–30). While the Ephesian Saints were no stranger to persecution from the Greco-Roman world (see Acts 19:24–41), of much greater concern to Paul was that the Ephesian Saints remain loyal to the Lord and their covenants. Moreover, much of Paul's epistles were written in part to correct false beliefs and attitudes that were arising in the various churches, just as he had foretold.5

Shortly before he was executed under Nero's command, Paul warned Timothy that the prophesied rebellion was then at hand, as many churches Paul established had forsaken him and the gospel: ""All they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes"" (2 Timothy 1:15). This rebellion even reached some of Paul's most trusted missionary companions: ""Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me"" (2 Timothy 4:10–11).",0,

The consequences persist in the various creeds of Christianity, which declare a Godhead of only one being and which describe that single being or God as ""incomprehensible"" and ""without body, parts, or passions."" One of the distinguishing features of the doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is its rejection of all of these postbiblical creeds (see Stephen E. Robinson, *Are Mormons Christians?* Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1991; *Encyclopedia of Mormonism,* ed. Daniel H. Ludlow, 4 vols., New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1992, s.v. ""Apostasy,"" ""doctrine,"" ""God the Father,"" and ""Godhead"").

In the process of what we call the Apostasy, the tangible, personal God described in the Old and New Testaments was replaced by the abstract, incomprehensible deity defined by compromise with the speculative principles of Greek philosophy. The received language of the Bible remained, but the so-called ""hidden meanings"" of scriptural words were now explained in the vocabulary of a philosophy alien to their origins. In the language of that philosophy, God the Father ceased to be a Father in any but an allegorical sense. He ceased to exist as a comprehensible and compassionate being. And the separate identity of his Only Begotten Son was swallowed up in a philosophical abstraction that attempted to define a common substance and an incomprehensible relationship.",2,

They believe that God is a spirit and that the Godhead is only one God. In our view, these concepts are evidence of the falling away we call the Great Apostasy.

We maintain that the concepts identified by such nonscriptural terms as ""the incomprehensible mystery of God"" and ""the mystery of the Holy Trinity"" are attributable to the ideas of Greek philosophy. These philosophical concepts transformed Christianity in the first few centuries following the deaths of the Apostles. For example, philosophers then maintained that physical matter was evil and that God was a spirit without feelings or passions. Persons of this persuasion, including learned men who became influential converts to Christianity, had a hard time accepting the simple teachings of early Christianity: an Only Begotten Son who said he was in the express image of his Father in Heaven and who taught his followers to be one as he and his Father were one, and a Messiah who died on a cross and later appeared to his followers as a resurrected being with flesh and bones.

The collision between the speculative world of Greek philosophy and the simple, literal faith and practice of the earliest Christians produced sharp contentions that threatened to widen political divisions in the fragmenting Roman empire. This led Emperor Constantine to convene the first churchwide council in a.d. 325. The action of this council of Nicaea remains the most important single event after the death of the Apostles in formulating the modern Christian concept of deity. The Nicene Creed erased the idea of the separate being of Father and Son by defining God the Son as being of ""one substance with the Father.""",3,

Talmage wrote *The Great Apostasy*, in which he gathered New Testament passages that Latter-day Saints have cited to show that a great apostasy was predicted by Jesus Christ, Paul, and other apostles and prophets (esp. Matt. 24:4-13, 23-26; Acts 20:29-30; Gal. 1; 2 Thes. 2:7-8; 1 Tim. 4:1-3; 2 Tim. 3:1-6;4:1-4; Jude 1:3-4; Rev. 13:4-9;14:6-7; and in the Old Testament, Amos 8:11-12). Talmage also chronicled the persecution of early Christians that hastened the Apostasy and described the primitive Church as changing internally in several respects. He argued that the simple principles of the gospel were mixed with the pagan philosophical systems of the day (Trinitarianism, resulting in the Nicene Creed; false opposition of body and spirit, creating excessive asceticism); that rituals were changed and added to in unauthorized ways (simple early Christian rites were replaced by complex pagan-influenced ceremonies; baptism by immersion was lost; the baptism of infants was introduced cf. [Moro. 8]; communion was changed); and that church organization was altered (the apostles and prophets, the necessary foundation of the church of Christ, were martyred, leaving a void that could not be filled by bishops; thus the medieval church showed little similarity to the organization or practices of the New Testament church).",2,

In 1833, referring to Mark 16:17-18 and 1Corinthians 12, Joseph Smith stated: ""By the foregoing testimonies we may look at the Christian world and see [that] the apostasy there has been from the apostolic platform"" (*TPJS*, p. 15). Oliver Cowdery wrote on the apostasy in the first issue of the messenger and advocate (1834). In 1840 Orson Pratt spoke of ""a general and awful apostasy from the religion of the New Testament"" (*Listen to the Voice of Truth*, 1.1). He particularly emphasized a lack of binding ordinances because of the absence of priesthood authority; baptism was a key example. In Pratt's view all churches before the Restoration were wrong in some ways, doctrinally and ritually, even though they might be right in others. Benjamin Winchester, an early LDS pamphleteer, wrote an extensive treatise using New Testament sources to demonstrate that an apostasy had been prophesied (*A History of Priesthood*, Philadelphia, 1843, pp. 72-96). In the 1850s and 1860s many references were made to ""the great apostasy"" (O. Pratt, *JD* 12:247) and ""the great falling away"" (W. Woodruff, *JD* 8:262) in Latter-day Saint sermons.

This idea-breaking off from established religion because it seems out of tune with New Testament Christianity-has obvious Protestant overtones, but the LDS view differs from typical Protestant attitudes in its emphasis on the loss and restoration of exclusive, clear-cut priesthood authority, correct ordinances, and continuing revelation. In contrast, Protestants typically rely primarily on biblical reinterpretation.",1,

Latter-day Saints who have seriously contravened or ignored cardinal Church teachings (publicly or privately) are considered apostates, whether or not they have officially left the Church or affiliated with another religion. By not participating in Church meetings one is not considered apostate. However, when individuals ask to have their names removed from Church records, policy requires such requests to be honored. A Church disciplinary procedure may be held for any member who violates important commandments and ""will not repent"" (Mosiah 26:32; D&C 42:28). Open repudiation of the Church, its leaders, and teachings is one ground for excommunication.

The steps to apostasy are usually gradual. All members are counseled to guard against all manifestations of personal apostasy (*DS* 3:293-312; Asay, pp. 67-68). The most frequent causes of apostasy are failure to maintain strict standards of morality, taking personal offense (real or perceived), marrying someone who is of another faith or who is irreligious, neglecting to pray and maintain spirituality, or misunderstanding of the teachings of the Church.

Apostasy may be accelerated by a faulty assumption that scripture or Church leaders are infallible. Joseph Smith taught that ""a prophet was a prophet only when he was acting as such"" (*HC* 5:265). He also declared he ""was but a man, and [people] must not expect me to be perfect"" (*HC* 5:181). Neither the Church nor its leaders and members claim infallibility.

Above all, the Church affirms that its members should seek personal revelation to know the truth and live in tune with the spirit of God. Those who have not done this may drop by the wayside when their faith is challenged or when difficulties arise.",2,

Both categories are authoritative, since both are viewed as coming from God.

The first definition uses ""scripture"" as synonymous with such terms as ""inspired"" or ""divinely revealed."" Concerning those who have been called and ordained to proclaim God's word, a revelation in the Doctrine and Covenants provides the foundation: ""Whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation"" (D&C 68:4). In this light, Latter-day Saints hold in high regard the words of Church leaders at all levels. Especially authoritative are the official pronouncements of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who are sustained by Church members as ""prophets, seers, and revelators."" Their writings and addresses-particularly in general conference-are cited frequently as guides for living and for authoritative interpretation of doctrine. Statements issued by the First Presidency represent the official position and policy of the Church.

Joseph Smith taught that ""a prophet was a prophet only when he was acting as such"" (*HC* 5:265). Thus, the words of prophets carry the force of scripture only when they are uttered under the influence of the Holy Ghost. Latter-day Saints freely acknowledge this divine influence in the teachings and counsel of leaders and deem it a privilege to be instructed by them. They consider this inspired direction to be ""scripture"" in the broad definition and endeavor to harmonize their lives with it.",3,Nyma

Latter-day Saints teach that all are entitled to this assurance and testimony. Second, the President of the Church and those associated with him as prophets, seers, and revelators have received a special spiritual Endowment and jurisdiction. The President alone speaks or writes for the Church and to the Church as a whole. Others can function similarly, but only within their own offices and callings. Further, ""a prophet was a prophet only when he was acting as such"" (*HC* 5:265; 2:302; *TPJS*, p. 278).

The idea of an open canon has meant historically a certain openness to other historical, apocryphal, and pseudepigraphical sources. Modern scripture assures Latter-day Saints that important records will yet come to light (cf. 2 Ne. 29:10-14; A of F 9). The Old Testament Apocrypha contains many things ""that are true"" but also many interpolations (D&C 91); ""To those who desire it, should be given by the Spirit to know the true from the false"" (*HC* 1:363).

These constitute the canonized, authoritative corpus of revealed writings against which all else is measured. President Joseph Fielding Smith taught, ""My words, and the teachings of any other member of the Church, high or low, if they do not square with the revelations, we need not accept them&#133;. We have accepted the four standard works as the measuring yardsticks, or balances, by which we measure every man's doctrine"" (*DS* 3:203).

While the Church views its scriptures as a canon in a strict sense, they are not viewed as closed. The doctrine of continuing revelation is one of the fundamental beliefs of the Church. As was expressed by Joseph Smith, ""We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God"" (A of F 9). While accepting ""all that God has revealed,"" whether canonized in the scriptures or not, Latter-day Saints also believe that revelation continues to enlighten their leaders. Moreover, additional divine guidance is anticipated because God ""will yet reveal many great and important things."" Those future revelations will be scripture, according to the broad definition, and it is likely that some of them will be added to the scriptures in due time.

The Church's lay participation, which entails the sharing of responsibility, and the law of common consent operate together in the process of presenting, confirming, and accepting the inspired word.

For Latter-day Saints, the scriptures are not reducible to scientific history, sociology, or folklore; a simple set of fundamentals, commandments, and legal apparatus; charming parabolic accounts; esoteric and hidden names with mystical connections that have a power and life of their own. The scriptures are the result of an outpouring from on high whose present meaning and relevance to a person require painstaking study and direct inspiration.

Objecting to the views of the Torah as a closed world, Martin Buber wrote, ""To you God is one who created once and not again; but to us God is He who ""renews the work of creation every day.' To you God is One who revealed Himself once and no more; but to us He speaks out of the burning thornbush of the present&#133;in the revelations of our innermost hearts-greater than words"" (p. 204). This statement captures much of the spirit of the LDS approach to scripture. Meaning and power rise against ""hardening"" traditions and sponsor trust in the living witness of the Spirit to illumine, clarify, and sanctify scripture as the ""present truth.""

The example that always comes up is the Song of Solomon. We've talked about this, but in Joseph Smith's Translation of the Bible, he wrote a note that the Song of Solomon is not inspired writing. But outside of that, I can't think of anything in the canon, in the four standard works, that we wouldn't consider scripture.

Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord promised in 1831 to lead the Saints to a ""land of promise"" (D&C 38:18; cf. Ex. 3:8). Because of persecution by enemies and sin among Church members, Joseph Smith was unsuccessful in establishing a permanent community (D&C 101:1-8). After his death, the Saints migrated to the Rocky Mountains, ""a land of peace"" (D&C 136:16), and still anticipate fulfillment of the Lord's promises to open the way for building New Jerusalem in the designated place (D&C 42:9;57:1-5;101:9-22).

Because the earth belongs to the Lord (Ps. 24:1), those who inherit a Promised Land must covenant to ""serve the God of the land,"" who will then keep them ""free from bondage, and from captivity"" (Ether 2:12); otherwise they will ""be swept off"" (Ether 2:10; cf. Deut. 27-28).

From the beginning, the Lord has reserved choice lands for righteous followers. They include the Garden of Eden for Adam and Eve (Gen. 2:9), a ""land of promise"" for Enos (Moses 6:17), and Zion for Enoch and his people (Moses 7:19). Notably, God received up Zion's inhabitants (Moses 7:69), who will return to earth to the New Jerusalem during the last days (Moses 7:62-64; Rev. 21:2). Moreover, God gave the land of Canaan ""unto [Abraham's] seed&#133;for an everlasting possession"" if ""they hearken to [God's] voice"" (Abr. 2:6). This promise was partially fulfilled when Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt to Canaan.

The Book of Mormon Peoples, including the family of Lehi and the jaredites, were given a Promised Land in the hemisphere now called the Americas, on condition of keeping God's commandments (1 Ne. 2:20; Ether 1:42-43). The prophet Moroni 2 warned future inhabitants of this land: ""Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free&#133;if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ"" (Ether 2:12). This admonition applies to all lands that the Lord has promised to any of his peoples.",2,

This admonition and promise is repeated throughout the Book of Mormon—that Lehi and his descendants would inherit a ""land of promise"" in the New World. This covenant was bound up with the Lord's covenant with this remnant of the House of Israel and was foundational to the Nephite view of land and history (2 Nephi 1).1: 229–45; ""The Covenant of the Promised Land: Territorial Symbolism in the Book of Mormon,"" FARMS Review 22, no. 2 (2010): 137–154."")

The Book of Mormon describes the identity and importance of this ""land of promise"" in various ways. These include:

| **DESCRIPTION** | **REFERENCE** |
| --- | --- |
| **""a land which [the Lord has] prepared""** | 1 Nephi 2:20 |
| **""a land which is choice above all other lands""** | 2 Nephi 1:5 |

| **""a land of thine inheritance""** | 2 Nephi 10:10 |
| **""a land of liberty""** | 2 Nephi 10:11 |
| **""preserved""** | Ether 2:7 |

The prophets Ether and Moroni prophesied that ""a New Jerusalem"" would be built in the land of promise (Ether 13:3–6, 9–10; cf. 3 Nephi 21:23–24). However, these prophets made it clear that the New Jerusalem could only be built on the principles of righteousness, and only by keeping the Lord's commandments could those living in the land of promise receive the blessings of the covenant. Otherwise, ""the judgments of him that is just shall rest upon them, . . . and he will take away from them the lands of their possessions,"" and ""they should be swept off when the fulness of his wrath should come upon them"" (2 Nephi 1:10-11; Ether 2:8).",2,

Historically, Latter-day Saint leaders have understood the land of promise given to Lehi and his descendants as encompassing the span of North and South America. For instance, Elder Orson Pratt, writing in 1840, taught that ""the Lord gave unto [Lehi's seed] the whole continent, for a land of promise, and he promised, that they, and their children after them, should inherit it, on condition of their obedience to his commandments.""2: 17, online at josephsmithpapers.org. Elder Pratt, in the same publication (pp. 16, 21), understood that the Book of Mormon describes Lehi's colony as landing in South America, and that centuries later ""the Lamanites . . . dwelt in South America, and the Nephites in North America,"" making it clear that Pratt had a hemispheric New World geography in mind with his comments. This makes sense in light of how contemporary nineteenth century American English defined the concept of the ""American continent."" See ""America,"" in American Dictionary of the English Language, online at webstersdictionary1828.com."") Elder B. H. Roberts similarly stated, ""The Book of Mormon teaches that the two American continents [North and South America] are a promised land, consecrated to righteousness and to liberty, and especially dedicated to the seed of the Patriarch Joseph, son of Jacob, of Bible fame, and to the Gentile races, who shall in the last days be gathered to the land as well as the descendants of Joseph.""3, 1:403."") In 1968 President Alvin R. Dyer likewise taught, ""America, or the continent of America, is the promised and choice land, choice above all other lands.""4

Modern revelation identifies Jackson County, Missouri as ""the land which [the Lord has] appointed and consecrated for the gathering of the saints"" as ""the land of promise, and the place for the city of Zion"" (Doctrine and Covenants 57:1–2). While this usage of Zion refers to a specific location (much like how Zion is identified with the Old World city of Jerusalem in the Hebrew Bible), the broader concept of Zion can take on multiple meanings depending on context.5; Enoch's city (D&C 38:4; Moses 7:18–69); Old World Jerusalem (2 Samuel 5:6–7; 1 Kings 8:1); New Jerusalem in Jackson County (D&C 84:1–4); All of North and South America (Teachings of Prophet Joseph Smith, 362; D&C 133); The dwelling place of exalted beings (Hebrews 12:22–24). See Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, 2nd ed. (Salt Lake City, UT: Bookcraft, 1966), 854–855."")

Indeed, the Prophet Joseph Smith on one occasion declared that ""the whole of North and South America is Zion. The mountain of the Lord's house is in the center of North and South America.""6 He also taught that while Zion ""consisted of all North and South America,"" it also includes ""any place where the Saints gather.""7 Thus, he included among his thirteen Articles of Faith the belief ""in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes,"" and that Zion (in other words the New Jerusalem) will be built upon ""the American continent, that Christ will reign personally upon the earth"" (A of F 10).

### **Comments**

Before leaving the Old World, Jehovah promised Lehi that he would lead them to a new land. After leaving their lands behind, they would be rewarded with a new home. The description of that new land as a land of promise has led to an inevitable association with the Israelites promised land. However, it is not clear whether or not that is a legitimate comparison.

Both the phrase ""land of promise"" and ""promised land"" occur with great frequency in Nephi's writings, and, to a lesser extent in the rest of the Book of Mormon. They do not appear at all in the Old Testament. The phrase ""land of promise"" does occur in Hebrews 11:9, where it speaks of Abraham leaving his home and ""sojourning in the land of promise, as in a strange country.""

Tradition promises the land that Abraham was given as an inheritance for his descendants, but it was never an entire continent, never an entire hemisphere, never more than a relatively small section of land. Thus, when we read the Book of Mormon's land of promise as any large expanse of territory, we are reading modern ideas backwards into the text in ways that the ancient people would never have understood.

As Lehi discusses this land of promise, it will never describe the dimensions of that land. What he will emphasize is the promise that is associated with the land. It is promised to his children forever, but upon conditions of righteousness. The Nephites, whose story exemplifies that promise of the land, eventually lose it. It was given them, but they will not keep it.",1,

And if it so be that they shall keep his commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this land, and there shall be none to molest them, nor to take away the land of their inheritance; and they shall dwell safely forever.

### **Comments**

This divine promise first appears in 1 Nephi 2:20, where Nephi writes what Jehovah told him: ""And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands."" When Nephi wrote of the angel's command to slay Laban, he ""remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments, they shall prosper in the land of promise"" (1 Nephi 4:14).

For both Lehi and Nephi, the most important aspect of the promise of the land was the conditional requirement for peace and prosperity. There was never an unconditional location for Lehi's descendants, and indeed, the Nephites were forced from their lands and had to move to a new location. When the Nephites arrived in Zarahemla they referred to their lost lands as their first inheritance. They had lost one land of promise, and their continued invocation of the promise should tell us that they considered a promise to move with them, even when they were no longer on the land of their first inheritance, or even later when they were removed from the land southward entirely.

The promise of the land was important for the promise, not for the land.",1,

True, in the early days of the Church, conversion often meant emigration as well. But now the gathering takes place in each nation. The Lord has decreed the establishment of Zion in each realm where He has given His Saints their birth and nationality. Scripture foretells that the people ""shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise."" ""Every nation is the gathering place for its own people."" The place of gathering for Brazilian Saints is in Brazil; the place of gathering for Nigerian Saints is in Nigeria; the place of gathering for Korean Saints is in Korea; and so forth. Zion is ""the pure in heart."" Zion is wherever righteous Saints are. Publications, communications, and congregations are now such that nearly all members have access to the doctrines, keys, ordinances, and blessings of the gospel, regardless of their location.

President Nelson concluded: ""Spiritual security will always depend upon *how* one lives, not *where* one lives. Saints in every land have equal claim upon the blessings of the Lord.""15 So while the Book of Mormon teaches that what is now called the American continent was a ""land of promise"" to Lehi's seed, and that later events on this land of promise would play a central role in the restoration of the gospel, the ideals and blessings of Zion are universal, and apply to men and women in all lands or countries who covenant to serve the Lord and do his will. This includes remembering the Lord and his goodness, respecting the land and all of His creation, keeping holy things pure and protected, obeying all of His commandments, loving Him with all one's heart, might, mind, and strength (Deuteronomy 6:5) and one's neighbor as oneself (Leviticus 19:18).

To members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Book of Mormon forms the doctrinal foundation of the Church and speaks the word of God to all the world.

The Book of Mormon both confirms and supplements the Bible: ""Behold, this [the Book of Mormon] is written for the intent that ye may believe that [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe [the Book of Mormon] also"" (Morm. 7:9). The Bible is primarily a record of God's dealings with the forebears and descendants of Jacob or Israel in the ancient Near East. Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of God's dealings principally with another group of Israelites he brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem about 600 B.C. (see Lehi). They anticipated the birth and coming of Jesus Christ and believed in his Atonement and gospel. Their complex, lengthy records were abridged by a prophet named Mormon, inscribed on plates of gold, and buried by his son, Moroni 2, after internecine wars destroyed all of the believers in Christ in the New World except Moroni (A.D. 385).",3,

Three mutually supportive avenues are most often followed. First, the book serves as a source of guidance and doctrine, yielding lessons and wisdom applicable to contemporary life. This approach is recommended in the writings of Nephi, who wrote that he ""did liken the scriptures unto [his people], that it might be for [their] profit and learning"" (1 Ne. 19:23). Latter-day Saints find its pages rich with ennobling narratives, clear doctrines, eternal truths, memorable sayings, and principles. Knowing the conditions of the latter days, the ancient prophets periodically address the individual reader directly. Latter-day Saints emphasize the need to read the Book of Mormon prayerfully, with faith in God, to benefit personally from its teachings and to come unto Christ.

A second approach to the Book of Mormon, adding historical dimension to the first approach, is to study the book as an ancient text. The reader who accepts the Book of Mormon as an ancient Hebrew lineage history written by prophets in the New World will find the book consistent with that description and setting. The book is a repository of ancient cultures that are as far removed from modern readers as are those of the Old and New Testaments. Continuing research has found Hebrew poetic forms, rhetorical patterns, and idioms, together with many Mesoamerican symbols, traditions, and artifacts, to be implicit in the book or consistent with it.",1,

He knew, however, that some people would refuse to believe and would object to receiving more scripture. So He said:

""Many of the Gentiles shall say: A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.

""Know ye not that there are more nations than one? Know ye not that I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I remember those who are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule in the heavens above and in the earth beneath; and I bring forth my word unto the children of men, yea, even upon all the nations of the earth?

""Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall receive more of my word? Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness unto you that I am God, that I remember one nation like unto another? Wherefore, I speak the same words unto one nation like unto another. And when the two nations shall run together the testimony of the two nations shall run together also.

""And I do this that I may prove unto many that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and that I speak forth my words according to mine own pleasure. And because that I have spoken one word ye need not suppose that I cannot speak another; for my work is not yet finished; neither shall it be until the end of man, neither from that time henceforth and forever.

""Wherefore, because that ye have a Bible ye need not suppose that it contains all my words; neither need ye suppose that I have not caused more to be written.

""For I command all men, both in the east and in the west, and in the north, and in the south, and in the islands of the sea, that they shall write the words which I speak unto them; for out of the books which shall be written I will judge the world, every man according to their works, according to that which is written.",3,

If the Old Testament words of Moses were sufficient, as some could have mistakenly thought them to be,3 then why, for example, the subsequent prophecies of Isaiah or of Jeremiah, who follows him? To say nothing of Ezekiel and Daniel, of Joel, Amos, and all the rest. If one revelation to one prophet in one moment of time is sufficient for *all* time, what justifies these many others? What justifies them was made clear by Jehovah Himself when He said to Moses, ""My works are without end, and … my words … never cease.""4

One Protestant scholar has inquired tellingly into the erroneous doctrine of a closed canon. He writes: ""On what biblical or historical grounds has the inspiration of God been limited to the written documents that the church now calls its Bible? … If the Spirit inspired only the written documents of the first century, does that mean that the same Spirit does not speak today in the church about matters that are of significant concern?""5 We humbly ask those same questions.

Continuing revelation does not demean or discredit existing revelation. The Old Testament does not lose its value in our eyes when we are introduced to the New Testament, and the New Testament is only enhanced when we read the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. In considering the additional scripture accepted by Latter-day Saints, we might ask: Were those early Christians who for decades had access only to the primitive Gospel of Mark (generally considered the first of the New Testament Gospels to be written)—were they offended to receive the more detailed accounts set forth later by Matthew and Luke, to say nothing of the unprecedented passages and revelatory emphasis offered later yet by John? Surely they must have rejoiced that ever more convincing evidence of the divinity of Christ kept coming. And so do we rejoice.",3,

However, Joseph Smith recognized that translations do not reflect totally and exactly the original words and intentions of the ancient prophets and other biblical writers. Thus, in the Wentworth Letter he wrote, ""We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly"" (A of F 8). Joseph Smith observed that ""our latitude and longitude can be determined in the original Hebrew with far greater accuracy than in the English version. There is a grand distinction between the actual meaning of the prophets and the present translation"" (*TPJS*, pp. 290-91). While Latter-day Saints accept rather explicitly what the Bible now says, they realize that more is to be accounted for than is available in the extant biblical record.",2,

Since it is clear that there were Christians long before there was a New Testament or even an accumulation of the sayings of Jesus, it cannot therefore be maintained that the Bible is what makes one a Christian. In the words of esteemed New Testament scholar N. T. Wright, ""The risen Jesus, at the end of Matthew's Gospel, does not say, 'All authority in heaven and on earth is given to the books you are all going to write,' but [rather] 'All authority in heaven and on earth is given to me.' ""10 In other words, ""Scripture itself points … away from itself and to the fact that final and true authority belongs to God himself.""11 So the scriptures are *not* the ultimate source of knowledge for Latter-day Saints. They are manifestations of the ultimate source. The ultimate source of knowledge and authority for a Latter-day Saint is the living God. The communication of those gifts comes from God as living, vibrant, divine revelation.12",1,

The Church's lay participation, which entails the sharing of responsibility, and the law of common consent operate together in the process of presenting, confirming, and accepting the inspired word.

For Latter-day Saints, the scriptures are not reducible to scientific history, sociology, or folklore; a simple set of fundamentals, commandments, and legal apparatus; charming parabolic accounts; esoteric and hidden names with mystical connections that have a power and life of their own. The scriptures are the result of an outpouring from on high whose present meaning and relevance to a person require painstaking study and direct inspiration.

Objecting to the views of the Torah as a closed world, Martin Buber wrote, ""To you God is one who created once and not again; but to us God is He who ""renews the work of creation every day.' To you God is One who revealed Himself once and no more; but to us He speaks out of the burning thornbush of the present&#133;in the revelations of our innermost hearts-greater than words"" (p. 204). This statement captures much of the spirit of the LDS approach to scripture. Meaning and power rise against ""hardening"" traditions and sponsor trust in the living witness of the Spirit to illumine, clarify, and sanctify scripture as the ""present truth.""

The idea of an open canon has meant historically a certain openness to other historical, apocryphal, and pseudepigraphical sources. Modern scripture assures Latter-day Saints that important records will yet come to light (cf. 2 Ne. 29:10-14; A of F 9). The Old Testament Apocrypha contains many things ""that are true"" but also many interpolations (D&C 91); ""To those who desire it, should be given by the Spirit to know the true from the false"" (*HC* 1:363). By analogy, other documents recently recovered (e.g., the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Nag Hammadi library, and related inscriptions and fragments) are viewed as instructive, though not canonical. In some cases, their teachings anticipate and echo authentic scriptural materials.",1,

In effect, these passages contain the same injunction as the one at the close of the Apocalypse; and if the same interpretation and argument was applied to them as is applied to the closing verses of the book of Revelation, there would be no scripture after the writings of Moses. Such an absurdity would result in discarding the greater part of the Old Testament and all of the books of the New Testament.

A careful reading of each of these admonitions makes it clear that *man* is not to make changes in the revelations of the Lord: *man* is not to add to or take from the words of God. There is no indication or intimation that God could not, or would not, add to or take from; nor would any reasonable person with a belief in the divine powers of God consciously believe that God would be so restricted. Without question he would have the right and power to give additional revelation for the guidance of his children in any age and to add additional scripture.",1,

We remember that at the end of the book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible, the author, John, issues a warning and a curse upon any man who adds to or takes away from the book. Specifically, these are the words he wrote:

""For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:

""And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."" (Rev. 22:18–19.)

These verses of scripture have been cited repeatedly by those attempting to discredit the Book of Mormon, claiming that God's revelation to man is closed. Nothing more is to be added and nothing is to be taken away. They assert that the Book of Mormon is an attempt to add to the words of the Bible. These claims were made when the Book of Mormon was first published and have continued to be made, and are made today. Is there any validity to such assertions?",2,

However, there is now overwhelming consensus among virtually all biblical scholars that this verse applies only to the book of Revelation, *not* the whole Bible. Those scholars of our day acknowledge a number of New Testament ""books"" that were almost certainly written *after* John's revelation on the Isle of Patmos was received. Included in this category are at least the books of Jude, the three Epistles of John, and probably the entire Gospel of John itself.1 Perhaps there are even more than these.

But there is a simpler answer as to why that passage in the final book of the current New Testament cannot apply to the whole Bible. That is because the whole Bible as we know it—one collection of texts bound in a single volume—did not exist when that verse was written. For centuries after John produced his writing, the individual books of the New Testament were in circulation singly or perhaps in combinations with a few other texts but almost *never* as a complete collection. Of the entire corpus of 5,366 known Greek New Testament manuscripts, only 35 contain the whole New Testament as we now know it, and 34 of those were compiled after a.d. 1000.2",2,

Were it not for continuous revelation, Noah would not have been prepared for the deluge that encompassed the earth. Abraham would not have been guided from Haran to Hebron, the Land of Promise. Continuous revelation led the children of Israel from bondage back to their promised land. Revelation through prophets guided missionary efforts, directed the rebuilding of Solomon's temple, and denounced the infiltration of pagan practices among the Israelites.

Before the ascension of Christ, he promised the remaining eleven apostles, ""lo, I am with you alway, Even unto the end of the world."" (Matt. 28:20.) Following his ascension, he guided the Church by revelation until the death of the Apostles and subsequent apostasy of the Church of Jesus Christ.

A distinctive sign of the last days that will precede the eventual second coming of the Lord was seen in vision by that same Apostle who recorded the book of Revelation. He said:

""I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people."" (Rev. 14:6.)

If, for example, you go to Deuteronomy chapter 4 verses 1 through 2. God says O Israel, hearken unto the statutes and judgments and he says do not add unto the word which I command you and don't diminish it and don't take away. If you go back to Revelation chapter 22 verse 17, actually verse – Revelation 22 verse 19: ""If any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life."" People have interpreted this as saying no more revelation. No more revelation. And even here in D and C section 20 we want to be careful to not misinterpret what God has been saying in Deuteronomy, in the Book of Revelation, and right here.

It's not about God cannot add or change revelation. It actually comes to the core idea of a covenant which we've talked about a lot. And we've talked about it a lot because it' so significant. God wants to come together with us. And imagine God owns the covenant. He offers us the terms of the covenant. Should we be changing the terms? No. God can change the terms and offer them to us which we can accept, that's when we say amen after covenantal rituals but we are not supposed to be changing covenants. Now let me just use a brief example. If you've ever received a loan from a bank, say, for a mortgage? Would you go home with that agreement – that covenant with a bank – and you, without the bank's authorization, you change the agreement. That doesn't work. Now the bank can change the agreement; they can update the terms. It is their prerogative, they're the one who offered you all this money and so in some ways you're kind of duty-bound to follow their recommendations of really what they expect you to do. And if you don't, you have to give all the money back.",1,

The word ""canon"" is used infrequently, in part because it connotes finality, completion, closure. In principle and in fact, additions, as well as occasional official clarifications and translations, are made to the standard works in the dual process of presentation through living leaders and, in accord with the law of common consent, acceptance by members of the Church. In this way, Latter-day Saints bind themselves by covenant to uphold them as scripture. The addition to the Doctrine and Covenants of both a revelation about the Celestial Kingdom received by Joseph Smith and a vision of the redemption of the dead received by President Joseph F. Smith are modern examples (D&C 137, 138).

The perpetual unending character of the scripture, a corpus ever augmented by living witnesses in a setting of prophecy and testimony, is a sign and symbol of the inclusiveness of LDS faith (Davies, p. 61). Such a position is in contrast with finalist and minimalist views (""one canon is enough""). The Samaritans, for example, accorded scriptural status to the Pentateuch alone. For Latter-day Saints, scripture is not ""final revelation."" There is no unexpandable ""circle of faith."" No sacred texts, because of their acknowledged holiness, forbid the addition of more sacred texts. No document or collection is ""all-sufficient"" for redemption, for salvation, for complete enlightenment, or for the perfecting of the soul.",3,

This faith has characterized the lives of this people all through their history. It is a great legacy to inherit and to bequeath.

There is another kind of faith: more powerful, less known, infrequently observed. This faith in God compounds our ability to accomplish our righteous desires. It is the creative, and generative kind of faith. This is the faith save for the exercise of which things would not happen. This is the great causative force in human lives. This is the faith that moves mountains.

The scriptures teach that certain powers of heaven are governed by the faith of mortal men. The Lord's ability to help us succeed is limited only by our faith in him. ""For if there be no faith among the children of men God can do no miracle among them; wherefore, he showed not himself [unto them] until after their faith.

""Neither at any time hath any wrought miracles until after their faith; wherefore they first believed in the Son of God."" (Ether 12:12, 18.)

Action alone is not faith in the Savior, but acting in accordance with correct principles is a central component of faith. Thus, ""faith without works is dead"" (James 2:20).

The Prophet Joseph further explained that ""faith is not only the principle of action, but of power also, in all intelligent beings, whether in heaven or on earth"" (*Lectures on Faith,* 3). Thus, faith in Christ leads to righteous action, which increases our spiritual capacity and power. Understanding that faith is a principle of action and of power inspires us to exercise our moral agency in compliance with gospel truth, invites the redeeming and strengthening *powers* of the Savior's Atonement into our lives, and enlarges the *power* within us whereby we are agents unto ourselves (see D&C 58:28).",3,

In the epistle of James this principle is clearly taught: ""Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. … But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?"" (James 2:18, 20.) Plainly, we must have both faith and works to obtain all of the blessings we seek.",0,

*God has made provision through the Atonement of Jesus Christ for the salvation of the human family. Those things that God does for mankind are called ""grace."" Those things that people have to do for themselves are called ""works."" Both are necessary.*

*The Lord requires all persons to do all that they can do for themselves to obtain salvation. For instance, James said, ""Faith without works is dead"" (* [James 2:26*), and John wrote that the dead are judged ""according to their works"" (* Rev. 20:12*). Paul emphasized grace, but did not exclude works: ""By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.

This was a key feature of the Reformation Anabaptists, who believed, much as Latter-day Saints do, in personal revelation and individual responsibility. The Anabaptists rejected infant baptism, teaching instead that baptism was a cleansing covenant with God, entered into only after the exercise of faith and repentance. Many other Anabaptist doctrines are remarkably similar to Latter-day Saint beliefs, including the concept of restoration itself, which the Anabaptists called Restitution-meaning the restitution of the apostolic Church of the New Testament.

Not as many specific doctrines are shared with mainline Protestants, but Latter-day Saints do have in common a devoted faith in Jesus Christ as Redeemer of the world and as personal Savior. This faith was the moving force in the actions of Martin Luther and other early reformers, and was central to the life and work of the Prophet Joseph Smith. It remains today a central tenet of the Church.

I believe these reformers were inspired to create a religious climate in which God could restore lost truths and priesthood authority.

The day of the Reformation was dawning, but the path ahead was difficult. Persecutions would be severe, personal sacrifice overwhelming, and the cost beyond calculation. The reformers were pioneers, blazing wilderness trails in a desperate search for those lost points of reference which, they felt, when found would lead mankind back to the truth Jesus taught.

John Wycliffe, Martin Luther, Jan Hus, Zwingli, Knox, Calvin, and Tyndale all pioneered the period of the Reformation. Significant was the declaration of Tyndale to his critics: ""I will cause a boy that driveth the plough shall know more of the scripture than thou doest.""16

Such were the teachings and lives of the great reformers. Their deeds were heroic, their contributions many, their sacrifices great—but they did not restore the gospel of Jesus Christ.

When Martin Luther challenged the Catholic doctrine of the sacraments, boldly declaring that salvation comes not by human works but by the grace of God alone through faith in Jesus Christ, he set in motion a complex series of events that not only broke the religious stronghold of the Catholic church but also had a profound impact on political, social, and cultural events as well.

LDS perspective regards the Protestant Reformation as a preparation for the more complete restoration of the gospel that commenced with Joseph Smith. Thus, the Protestant Reformation initiated a return to pure Christianity, a work that could not be completed without divine revelation and restoration. The leaders of the Reformation are honored as inspired men who made important progress, but without direct revelation they could not recover the true gospel or the priesthood authority to act in God's name. That was the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith.",2,

There is no dispute about what Joseph Smith accomplished, only how he did what he did and why. And there are not many options. He was either pretender or prophet. Either he did what he did alone, or he had the help of heaven. Look at the evidence, but look at all of the evidence, the entire mosaic of his life, not any single piece. Most importantly, do as young Joseph and ""ask … God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given [you].""17 This is not only how you may learn the truth about the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith; it is also the pattern to know the truth of all things.18

Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, as is Thomas S. Monson today. Through Joseph Smith, ""the keys of the kingdom of God are [again] committed unto man on the earth, and … the gospel [will] roll forth … as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands … , until it has filled the whole earth.""19

God is our Eternal Father, and Jesus is the Christ. We worship Them. Nothing compares with Their creations, the plan of salvation, and the atoning sacrifice of the Lamb of God. In this dispensation, we fulfill the plan of the Father and partake of the fruits of the Atonement only by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I bear testimony of Them—God the Eternal Father and Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. And I do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",2,Pascal

His spiritual work began with the appearance of the Father and the Son, followed by numerous heavenly visitations. He was the instrument in God's hands in bringing forth sacred scripture, lost doctrine, and the restoration of the priesthood. The importance of Joseph's work requires more than intellectual consideration; it requires that we, like Joseph, ""ask of God.""9 Spiritual questions deserve spiritual answers from God.

Many of those who dismiss the work of the Restoration simply do not believe that heavenly beings speak to men on earth. Impossible, they say, that golden plates were delivered by an angel and translated by the power of God. From that disbelief, they quickly reject Joseph's testimony, and a few unfortunately sink to discrediting the Prophet's life and slandering his character.

We are especially saddened when someone who once revered Joseph retreats from his or her conviction and then maligns the Prophet.10

""Studying the Church … through the eyes of its defectors,"" Elder Neal A. Maxwell once said, is ""like interviewing Judas to understand Jesus. Defectors always tell us more about themselves than about that from which they have departed.""11

Jesus said, ""Bless them that curse you, … and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.""12 Let us offer kindness to those who criticize Joseph Smith, knowing in our own hearts that he was a prophet of God and taking comfort that all this was long ago foretold by Moroni.

The revelations poured out upon Joseph Smith affirm that he was a prophet of God. Let's just look at some of them—just look at some of the light and truth revealed through him that shines in stark contrast to the common beliefs of his day and ours:

* God is a personal, exalted being, an Eternal Father. He is our Father.
* God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are separate beings.5
* You are more than human. You are a child of God the Eternal Father and may become like Him6 if you will have faith in His Son, repent, receive ordinances, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end.7
* The Church of Jesus Christ today is fundamentally the same Church He organized during His mortal ministry, with prophets and apostles, Melchizedek and Levitical Priesthoods, elders, high priests, deacons, teachers, bishops, and the seventy, all as described in the Bible.
* Priesthood authority was withheld from the earth following the deaths of the Savior and His Apostles and was restored again in our day.
* Revelation has not ceased, and the heavens are not closed. God speaks to prophets today, and He will speak to you and me as well.8
* There is more after this life than only heaven and hell. There are degrees of glory, and it matters a great deal what we do in this life.9
* More than having a mere passive belief in Christ, we should ""look unto [Him] in every thought,""10 ""do all that [we do] in the name of the Son,""11 and ""always remember him and keep his commandments … that [we] may always have his Spirit to be with [us].""12
* The billions who live and die without the gospel and the ordinances necessary for salvation are not lost. ""Through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel,""13 administered for both the living and the dead.14
* Everything did not begin at birth. You lived before in the presence of God as His son or daughter and prepared for this mortal life.15",0,

He chose a young man named Joseph Smith to learn about the eternal plan of salvation. Joseph was confused about the different religions in his community, but the scriptures led him to ask God what he should do.7 In answer to his prayer, God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him.8 Through this and other experiences, Joseph Smith was called as a prophet, like unto Moses and other biblical prophets.9 Because Joseph saw and talked with the Savior, his work was to restore the truth about the great plan of God and the divine mission of our Lord. I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.

The Prophet Joseph received authority to teach the gospel and bring forth additional scripture. He was commanded to translate writings of ancient prophets from The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. The Book of Mormon prophets also knew about the plan of salvation and the sacred mission of Jesus Christ. The appearance of the resurrected Christ to the ancient people of the Americas is recorded in this sacred book.10 He taught them His gospel and established His Church among them. I know that the Book of Mormon is another testament of the divinity of Jesus Christ.

God has promised that the Holy Ghost will testify to each of us that sacred truths have been restored and that Joseph Smith was called by God to be a special witness of Christ and His gospel. We may come to know the truth of all things God has revealed, through the power of the Holy Ghost.11

Millions of converts to this Church initially accepted the truths proclaimed by our missionaries in the first discussion. They then opened their hearts to all the discussions taught by the missionaries. They were invited to be baptized, confirmed, become ""fellowcitizens with the saints,""12 and continue on the gospel path to additional sacred covenants made in the temple.",1,

God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ revealed themselves to Joseph Smith in a marvelous vision. After that glorious event, Joseph Smith told a minister about it. Joseph was surprised to hear the minister say that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days, that all such things had ceased. (See JS—H 1:21.)

This remark symbolizes practically all of the objections that have ever been made against the Church by nonmembers and dissident members alike. Namely, they do not believe that God reveals his will today to the Church through prophets of God. All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage, seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation. Here, then, is a procedure to handle most objections through the use of the Book of Mormon.

First, understand the objection.

Second, give the answer from revelation.

Third, show how the correctness of the answer really depends on whether or not we have modern revelation through modern prophets.

Fourth, explain that whether or not we have modern prophets and revelation really depends on whether the Book of Mormon is true.

Therefore, the only problem the objector has to resolve for himself is whether the Book of Mormon is true. For if the Book of Mormon is true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a prophet receiving revelation.",0,

Author: Hardy, Grant R.

On September 21, 1823, the angel Moroni appeared to Joseph Smith and instructed him about a record engraved on thin goldlike sheets. The record, written by Moroni 2, his father Mormon, and other ancient inhabitants of the Americas, was buried in a stone box in a hill not far from the Smith residence. Moroni eventually delivered these plates to Joseph, who translated and published them as the Book of Mormon and returned them to Moroni. While the plates were in Joseph's keeping, others saw them, including eleven witnesses whose testimonies appear in all editions of the book. Various descriptions provided by eyewitnesses suggest that the plates may have been made of a gold alloy, measured about 6 inches by 8 inches (15.2 cm by 20.3 cm), were 6 inches (15.2 cm) thick, and weighed about 50 pounds (22.7 kg).

And I will give them a beautiful baptism in salvation … a share in righteousness with my saints.""7 In other words, the righteous Saints could request that salvation be shared with dead sinners, who would then be saved through baptism. Similarly, the *Shepherd of Hermas*, which was written only about forty years after Paul wrote 1 Corinthians and contained many quotations from early Christian scripture, describes how ""apostles and teachers who preached the name of the Son of God"" preached the Gospel to the living and the dead. Furthermore, these same Apostles and teachers ""descended with [the dead] into the water, and again ascended. But these descended alive and rose up again alive; whereas they who had previously fallen asleep descended dead, but rose up again alive.""8, 238. Archbishop Hilarion Alfeyev of the Eastern Orthodox faith has likewise noted that this verse is often understood in the context of proxy baptisms in Metropolitan Hilarion Alfeyev, Christ the Conqueror of Hell: The Descent into Hades from an Orthodox Perspective (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 2009), 25n33."")

In modern times, this ordinance and the authority to perform it has been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith and is performed in temples throughout the world. Baptism and other essential, saving ordinances are performed for those who were unable or unwilling to accept them in this life but might do so on the other side of the veil so they, too, might ""live according to God in the spirit"" (1 Peter 4:6). As we continue to worship in the temple and perform these ordinances, we have the assurance that just like the early Christians, we might stand as saviors on Mount Zion and bring the blessings of Jesus Christ's Atonement to all God's children on both sides of the veil.",3,

While it may be tempting to dismiss this ordinance because of its acceptance by heretical sects, Scott R. Peterson has observed that ""several logical fallacies exist"" in such an approach, especially regarding other ordinances such as the sacrament that were likewise accepted by these sects as well as the orthodox church.18, 395–431; and D. Jill Kirby, ""Living in the Afterlife: Heaven, Hell, and Places Between,"" in Ancient Christians, 392–449."")

After regarding these later theological developments, Krister Stendahl, the late Bishop of Stockholm for the Church of Sweden, noted: ""Once the theological pressures from later possible developments of practice and doctrine are felt less constricting, the text [1 Corinthians 15:29] seems to speak plainly enough about a practice within the Church of vicarious baptism for the dead.""19, 1:97.

This verse is part of Paul's argumentation against those who denied a future resurrection (cf. 2 Tim. 2:18,Justin, Dial. 80). He refers to a practice of vicarious baptism, a practice for which we have no other evidence in the Pauline or other New Testament or early Christian writings.

This appears to be especially the case with ordinances performed on behalf of the dead. David L. Paulsen and Brock M.

For an overview of these early Christian writings, see Book of Mormon Central, ""What Might Jesus Have Taught His Apostles for Forty Days? (Acts 1:3),"" KnoWhy 678 (July 4, 2023)."") The sacred silence placed upon this doctrine and these ordinances, then, limits the source material available to modern scholars for study.

When Clement, as an investigator, asked Peter, ""If those shall enjoy the kingdom of Christ, whom His coming shall find righteous, shall then those be wholly deprived of the kingdom who have died before His coming?"" Peter with reticence described the sacred nature of ordinances for the dead: ""You compel me, O Clement, to touch upon things that are unspeakable. But so far as it is allowed to declare them, I shall not shrink from doing so.""12 According to Hugh Nibley, this reticence reflects the ""occasions Peter and other apostles are forbidden to talk about certain things"" in the New Testament.13, 104."") This is especially evident in the bestowal of the apostolic keys upon Peter, giving him power over the gates of hell—that is, the realm of the dead—during which Jesus ""gave a watchword"" to His Apostles ""not to tell it to any man.""14",3,

1. This was a New Testament practice (1 Cor. 15:29; cf. D&C 128; see Baptism for the Dead: Ancient Sources).

2. The ministry of Christ in the spirit world was for the benefit of those who had died without hearing the gospel or the fulness of it (1 Pet. 4:6; see Salvation of the Dead).

3. Such baptisms are to be performed in temple fonts dedicated to the purpose (*TPJS*, p. 308; cf. D&C 124:29-35). In November 1841 the font in the unfinished Nauvoo Temple was so dedicated.

4. The language of the baptismal prayer is the same as for the living, with the addition of ""for and in behalf of"" the deceased.

5. Witnesses are to be present for proxy baptisms and a record is to be kept in Church archives (D&C 128:3, 8).

6. Women are to be baptized for women and men for men.

7. Not only baptism but confirmation and the higher temple ordinances may also be performed by proxy (*TPJS*, pp. 362-63).

8. The law of agency is inviolate in this world and the world to come. Thus, those served by proxy have the right to accept or reject the ordinances.

In the early years of the Church, proxy baptisms were performed only for direct blood ancestors, usually no more than four generations back. Today, Latter-day Saints are baptized not only for their own forebears but also for other persons, unrelated to them, identified through the name extraction program. The practice reflects the yearning of children for their parents and of parents for their children, and charitable feelings for others as well, that they receive the fulness of the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ. In LDS perspective, whatever else one may do to mourn, give honorable burial to, cherish, or memorialize the dead, this divinely authorized ordinance of baptism is a demonstration of love and has eternal implications.",2,

Col. 1:24).

Such a connection may be conscious or unconscious. In either case it makes it quite reasonable that Paul's remark refers to a practice of a vicarious baptism for the dead.

Seeing a widow in the congregation who had recently lost a son before he could be baptized, Joseph Smith introduced one of the most significant doctrines of the Restoration: baptisms for the dead.1: 41."") This ordinance would be the theme of many of Joseph's revelations, letters, and discourses during the following months, especially as the Nauvoo Temple was being constructed.2

As biblical evidence that this ordinance was performed in ancient Christianity, Joseph Smith turned to 1 Corinthians 15:29: ""Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?""3 This verse constitutes the only explicit reference to this ordinance for the deceased in the New Testament, and it has led many modern scholars to wonder what Paul might have been referring to and whether proxy baptisms were actually performed in antiquity. As additional texts have come to light, however, most scholars today conclude that the clearest reading of this verse states that early Christians actually performed vicarious ordinances for the dead.

For example, after reviewing attempts to interpret this passage as referring to a metaphor or a regular baptism, one scholar concluded that ""all interpretations which seek to evade vicarious baptism for the dead … are misleading.""4, 1:542n63."") Similarly, Reginald St. John Parry noted that ""the plain and necessary sense of the words implies the existence of a practice of vicarious baptism at Corinth, presumably on behalf of believers who died before they were baptised. … Many attempts have been made to evade this conclusion, but all at the cost of violence to the language. … In fact, all such evasions are wholly due to the unwillingness to admit such a practice, and still more such a reference to it by S.

As regards the Resurrection, Paul asked, ""Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not … ? why are they then baptized for the dead?""13 We are baptized for the dead because we know that they will rise. ""The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.""14 ""For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.""15

It matters tremendously what we do in relation to those who have gone before, because they live today as spirits and shall live again as immortal souls, and that because of Jesus Christ. We believe His words when He said, ""I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.""16 By the baptisms we perform in behalf of the dead, we testify that ""as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. …

Paul, in his great discussion about the Resurrection, reasoned: ""Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?""23 Doing something so vital for those who cannot do it for themselves is truly Christlike.

Latter-day Saints see the Church's teachings as true Christianity, restored to earth in its original purity by Christ himself, and thus they frequently refer to the Church, its doctrines, and its priesthood as ""restored"" (see Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ). Basic Church doctrines include belief in a personal God vitally concerned with his children, the divinity of the Savior Jesus Christ and his infinite Atonement, the universal need for repentance and baptism by proper authority, continuing revelation through living prophets, the brotherhood and sisterhood of all human beings, the eternal sanctity of marriage and family, and the responsibility to be self-reliant and to help others.

There is a God in heaven, a glorious personage, a holy man, who knows all things, has all power, and is infinite and eternal.

He is the Supreme Being, the Eternal Absolute, the Creator and peopler of worlds without number. He is our Father in Heaven, and he lives in the family unit.

We are his spirit children; all of us dwelt in the Eternal Presence before the foundations of this earth were laid; we have seen his face, heard his voice, and felt his spirit.

He ordained and established the laws whereby his children might advance and progress and become like him. These laws constitute the plan of salvation; they are the gospel of God.

This glorious gospel called for the creation of this earth as a place where man would come to gain a mortal body and be tried and tested as he walked by faith.

It called for the fall of Adam so that temporal and spiritual death would enter the world and pass upon all men.

It called for an infinite and eternal atonement—wrought by One who would be the Only Begotten in the flesh—which atonement would ransom men from their fallen state.",3,

God called, prepared, and sustained Joseph Smith, the Prophet of the Restoration. Prophets have no other purpose, no other mission except to serve God. Of his own sacred responsibility and holy calling, our living prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, has said: ""I have no desire other than to do that which the Lord would have done. I am His servant, called to serve His people. This is His Church. We are only custodians of that which belongs to Him.""20",2,

""Mormonism"" is an unofficial but common term for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the doctrinal, institutional, cultural, and other elements forming its distinctive worldview and independent Christian tradition. ""Mormons"" is the equivalent term for members of the Church, with ""Mormon"" being both the singular noun and the adjective.

Over the years these terms and other, less common variants have been widely used (such as ""Mormonite"" in early decades of the Church), but members prefer the official name revealed by the Savior to the Prophet Joseph smith-The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints-in order to emphasize the central role of Jesus Christ in their doctrine and worship (D&C 115:3-4). The shortened name that most contemporary members use instead of ""Mormonism"" is ""LDS Church,"" with ""LDS"" used in place of ""Mormon"" and ""Latter-day Saints"" or ""Saints"" used instead of ""Mormons.""

The term ""Mormon"" derives from the Book of Mormon, published in 1830 and recently subtitled *Another Testament of Jesus Christ*. This book is accepted by the Church as scripture along with the Bible (see Bible: LDS Belief in the Bible).",1,

After his resurrection, Jesus appeared to some of them, and organized his church, and for four generations they lived in peace and happiness. Many details about the religious teachings and practices of these people are found in the Book of Mormon. Latter-day Saints believe that these Christian teachings are applicable in the world today, both because the eternal doctrine of God is as binding on one generation as on the next and because the contents of the Book of Mormon were selected and preserved by prophets with the modern world in mind. These teachings are also found in the revelations that established contemporary LDS practices and ordinances.",1,

It comes when we are obedient to the commandments of God. Conversion comes when we serve those around us.

Strong evidence besides the Book of Mormon corroborates the claims of Joseph Smith. To begin with, the Three Witnesses and the Eight Witnesses, who handled the plates and saw the engravings, testified that the Book of Mormon was translated by the power of God. Members of Joseph Smith's family, who knew him best, also accepted and believed his message. Among the believers were his parents, his brothers and his sisters, and his uncle John Smith. His older brother Hyrum proved his complete faith in Joseph's work by giving his life along with Joseph. These reliable witnesses all confirm the Prophet's testimony.",2,

He is a god; however, he is not his own Father but a son of the Father, and the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind; the Mediator between God and man. There is no magic or confusion or mystery in this.

Those who have a testimony know that God our Father doesn't leave us without guidance on this earth today but has given us a living prophet to reveal the mind of the Lord and the word of the Lord and the will of the Lord for his children today.

Those who have a testimony know it is the desire of the Father ""that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world."" (D&C 1:20.) Therefore, he has once again given authority to man on earth to act for him, and by this authority or priesthood man has authority to baptize, to lay on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, to heal the sick, cast out devils, speak with new tongues, and, in general, show forth the signs that Jesus said would always follow the believers. (See Mark 16:17–18.)

Further, they know that by this same authority or priesthood a man and woman are married—not until death do they part, but for all eternity, for whatsoever is bound on earth will be bound in heaven. (See Matt. 16:19.) When these truths are not only believed but indelibly etched upon the heart of a man, woman, or child by the Holy Ghost, then the programs that the Lord established on the earth to allow his children to grow in light and knowledge and experience become a living, vital part of the pathway to immortality and eternal life.",3,

And now grave consequences hang on our response to the Book of Mormon. ""Those who receive it,"" said the Lord, ""in faith, and work righteousness, shall receive a crown of eternal life;

Parents, families, friends, and donors to the General Missionary Fund may also assist. All missionaries, younger and older, serve with the sole hope of making life better for other people.

The decision to serve a mission will shape the spiritual destiny of the missionary, his or her spouse, and their posterity for generations to come. A desire to serve is a natural outcome of one's conversion, worthiness, and preparation.

In this great worldwide audience, many of you are not affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and know very little about us and our missionaries. You are here or tuned in because you want to know more about the Mormons and what our missionaries teach. As you learn more about us, you will find that we share many of the same values. We encourage you to keep all that is good and true and then see if we can add more. In this world filled with challenges, we do need help from time to time. Religion, eternal truth, and our missionaries are vital parts of that help.

Our young missionaries set aside their education, occupation, dating, and whatever else young adults would typically be doing at this stage of life. For 18 to 24 months they put it all on hold because of their deep desire to serve the Lord.2 And some of our missionaries serve in their more mature years of life. I know their families are blessed. In our own family, eight are currently serving as full-time missionaries—three daughters, their husbands, one granddaughter, and one grandson.",3,

Eight men were called as General Authorities. Six women were called to the presidencies of the Relief Society and Young Women. Over two hundred men were called to serve as bishops, and over seventeen hundred men and women were called as full-time missionaries. In that same month, tens of thousands of others were called as officers and teachers and other workers in the many Church organizations throughout the world. Those called in April joined millions of others already serving in similar capacities in the restored Church.

As I contemplated my own calling and the callings of millions of others already in service, I was led to consider this question: Why do we serve?

Service is an imperative for those who worship Jesus Christ. To followers who were vying for prominent positions in his kingdom, the Savior taught, ""Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant."" (Matt. 20:27.) On a later occasion, he spoke of ministering to the needs of the hungry, the naked, the sick, and the imprisoned. He concluded that teaching with these words: ""Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."" (Matt. 25:40.)",1,

Missionary work results in many rejections. It is easy to be discouraged. ""And ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect; for mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts.""6

Third, be obedient, faithful, and true. Missionaries serve in companionships for protection. A missionary best protects his companion when he is loyal to the Lord and helps his companion. By keeping the missionary rules, you gain the freedom of having the Spirit assist you.

Fourth, teach and testify. ""And ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two, in my name, lifting up your voices as with the sound of a trump, declaring my word like unto angels of God.""7",2,

As the Apostle Paul said, we that are strong enough to bear the infirmities of the weak should not do so ""to please ourselves."" (Rom. 15:1.) Reasons aimed at earthly rewards are distinctly lesser in character and reward than the other reasons I will discuss.

Some may serve out of fear of punishment. The scriptures abound with descriptions of the miserable state of those who fail to follow the commandments of God. Thus, King Benjamin taught his people that the soul of the unrepentant transgressor would be filled with ""a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever."" (Mosiah 2:38.) Such descriptions surely offer sufficient incentive for keeping the commandment of service. But service out of fear of punishment is a lesser motive at best.",1,

As you prayerfully seek and cultivate missionary opportunities in your daily activities, you will find many ways to serve. They include helping to find, convert, and retain new members. The stake or full-time missionaries can teach you how to do that.

You can help the full-time and stake missionaries bring new investigators to church and make them feel comfortable. Let them know that they have a new friend. Strengthen that friendship by inviting them to your home or to Church activities with you. You can support them in obeying the commandments. Such valuable missionary service is not difficult because it can be carried out in the normal routine of your daily life.

There are other ways you may not think of as missionary service. For example, a young mother can teach each growing son to prepare to be a missionary to preach the gospel and to share his testimony of truth. As mother and father cultivate that thought throughout his growing years, he will be a missionary. That is excellent missionary service.",2,

These are those I would call the good soldiers, who instinctively do what they are asked without question and sometimes without giving much thought to the reasons for their service. Such persons fill the ranks of voluntary organizations everywhere, and they do much good. We have all benefited by the good works of such persons. Those who serve out of a sense of duty or loyalty to various wholesome causes are the good and honorable men and women of the earth.

Service of the character I have just described is worthy of praise and will surely qualify for blessings, especially if it is done willingly and joyfully. As the Apostle Paul wrote in his second letter to the Corinthians:

""But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

""Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver."" (2 Cor. 9:6–7.)

People serve one another for different reasons, and some reasons are better than others. Perhaps none of us serves in every capacity all the time for only a single reason. Since we are imperfect beings, most of us probably serve for a combination of reasons, and the combinations may be different from time to time as we grow spiritually. But we should all strive to serve for the reasons that are highest and best.

What are some of the reasons for service? By way of illustration, and without pretending to be exhaustive, I will suggest six reasons. I will discuss these in ascending order from the lesser to the greater reasons for service.

Some may serve for hope of earthly reward. Such a man or woman might serve in Church positions or in private acts of mercy in an effort to achieve prominence or cultivate contacts that would increase income or aid in acquiring wealth. Others might serve in order to obtain worldly honors, prominence, or power.",1,

Missionaries consider themselves emissaries of the Lord in proclaiming his message.

**WHO ARE CALLED.** In the first generation of the Church, married men frequently were called to be missionaries, and they left wives and families for an indeterminate length of time. In recent decades, the majority of missionaries have been young men and women who serve about two years.

Currently, the Church calls as missionaries, on a voluntary, temporary basis, single men from the ages of nineteen to twenty-six, single women twenty-one years and older, and older married couples with no dependent children. Missionary service is coordinated with military service as required.

Missionaries or their families generally cover the major costs of serving a mission. Missionaries called from developing nations may receive needed financial assistance from the general missionary fund of the Church. This assistance covers only basic living costs, as the Church has no paid ministry. No one is paid for missionary service.",3,

He said, ""I don't want to go."" I asked, ""What has that got to do with it? We need you.""

President Kimball has said we don't have *half enough* missionaries. Can't you see that it doesn't matter whether you want to go or not? You're needed! Do you know what it means to be needed? The bonds of brotherhood are forged deep and strong in the mission field. You will develop a love for a companion with whom you kneel in daily prayer. You will learn to love the people where you serve, no matter what nationality or condition. And they will love you. They will love you because you brought them the gospel.

Converts always remember those who taught them. I've heard many converts speak almost reverently of ""our missionaries."" Imagine having people pray for you. Do you understand what that means? This will always be a purifying and refining influence in your life.

Many people out there are praying for the truth. You are the one who can bring it to them best. At present only 18,000 of you are serving. There are nearly 60,000, 19 through 25, who have not. We need more, many more. Missionary service is not preempted by any other thing. Marriage does not take precedence. Your work does not have priority. Your education is interrupted to fill this calling. College-related activities may be timed to satisfy both school and mission requirements. Some of you may be physically handicapped. There may yet be opportunity to serve in fitting ways locally.

Your moral worthiness is a prime consideration. We want no flabbiness of character when spiritual strength is required. Study! Get some colored pencils. Keep them with your Book of Mormon. Underline verses important to you. Another tool of missionary work is an additional language. Study one. We should ""become acquainted with … languages, tongues, and people."" (D&C 90:15.)",1,

The Savior applied that principle in the Sermon on the Mount, in which he commanded us to love our enemies, bless them that curse us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them that despitefully use us and persecute us. (See Matt. 5:44.) He explained the purpose of that commandment as follows:

""For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?

""And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?"" (Matt. 5:46–47.)

This principle—that our service should be for the love of God and the love of fellowmen rather than for personal advantage or any other lesser motive—is admittedly a high standard. The Savior must have seen it so, since he joined his commandment for selfless and complete love directly with the ideal of perfection. The very next verse of the Sermon on the Mount contains this great commandment: ""Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."" (Matt. 5:48.)

This principle of service is reaffirmed in the fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants:

""Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day."" (D&C 4:2.)

We learn from this command that it is not enough to serve God with all of our *might and strength.* He who looks into our hearts and knows our minds demands more than this. In order to stand blameless before God at the last day, we must also serve him with all our *heart and mind.*

Service with all of our heart and mind is a high challenge for all of us. Such service must be free of selfish ambition. It must be motivated only by the pure love of Christ.",2,

Many have been, and many more will yet be, delivered from hell through hearing, repenting, and obeying the gospel of Jesus Christ in the spirit world after the death of the body. LDS doctrine emphasizes that after his mortal death Jesus Christ went to the spirit world and organized the teaching of the gospel there (D&C 138; cf. Luke 23:43; 1 Pet. 3:18-20). The Athanasian Creed and some forms of the ""Apostles""' Creed state that Christ ""descended into hell."" LDS teaching is that Jesus entered the spirit world to extend his redemptive mission to those in hell, upon conditions of their repentance (see Salvation of the Dead).

A third meaning of ""hell"" (second spiritual death) refers to the realm of the devil and his angels, including those known as sons of perdition (2 Pet. 2:4; D&C 29:38;88:113; Rev. 20:14). It is a place for those who cannot be cleansed by the Atonement because they committed the unforgivable and unpardonable sin (1 Ne. 15:35; D&C 76:30-49). Only this hell continues to operate *after* the Resurrection and Judgment.

These terms generally signify the abode of all the dead, whether righteous or disobedient, although *geenna* and *tartaróo* are associated with a place of punishment. The derivation and literal meaning of *sheol* are unknown, but words in Hebrew derived from it bear the idea of ""hollowness.""

Latter-day scriptures describe at least three senses of hell: (1) that condition of misery which may attend a person in mortality due to disobedience to divine law; (2) the miserable, but temporary, state of disobedient spirits in the spirit world awaiting the resurrection; (3) the permanent habitation of the sons of perdition, who suffer the second spiritual death and remain in hell even after the resurrection.

Persons experiencing the first type of hell can be rescued from suffering through repentance and obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The Savior suffered so that he could deliver everyone from hell (Alma 7:11-13;33:23). Those who do not repent, however, may experience the pains of hell in this life as well as in the next (D&C 76:104; 1 Ne. 16:2; Alma 40:14). The Prophet Joseph Smith described the true nature of hell: ""A man is his own tormenter and his own condemner. Hence the saying, They shall go into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone. The torment of disappointment in the mind of man is as exquisite as a lake burning with fire and brimstone"" (*TPJS*, p. 357). Thus, hell is both a place, a part of the world of spirits where suffering and sorrow occur, and a state of mind associated with remorseful realization of one's own sins (Mosiah 2:38; Alma 36:12-16).",3,

It is called the Church of Jesus Christ because He stands at the head; it is His Church, and all these things are possible because of His atoning sacrifice.

We believe that these distinguishing features can be found in no other place or organization on this earth. As good and sincere as other religions and churches are, none of them have the authority to provide the ordinances of salvation that are available in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

We have a knowledge of these things, but *do we believe them*? If these things are true, then we have the greatest message of hope and help that the world has ever known. Believing them is a matter of eternal significance for us and for those we love.

To believe, we need to get the gospel from our heads into our hearts! It is possible for us to merely go through the motions of living the gospel because it is expected or because it is the culture in which we have grown up or because it is a habit. Perhaps some have not experienced what King Benjamin's people felt following his compelling sermon: ""They all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.""3",0,

The attempt is made to have all boys and girls hold some kind of leadership position during their teens. Serving missions places many young men and women into a wide variety of leadership positions (e.g., as senior companions, district leaders, zone leaders, and assistants to the mission president). Virtually all Latter-day Saints are asked to serve in the Church in one way or another. In general, the guidelines for leadership are the same for men and women.

For many callings, an unofficial apprenticeship system is followed. Often, a counselor in a presidency or another officer in the respective organization will be called as its next president; similarly, a man trained as an assistant clerk may be called as the next clerk. Sometimes, however, one is appointed to a position to which he has had no training, as the bishop or stake president follows the impressions of the Spirit in extending calls to service.",3,

After the meeting, the other deacons rallied around him to tell him how proud they were of their fellow quorum member.

As I visited with them that day, I found out that each week, members of all the Aaronic Priesthood quorums in that ward reach out to other young men and invite them to be part of their quorums.

These young men were all great leaders. And they clearly had some wonderful behind-the-scenes Melchizedek Priesthood holders, parents, and others who mentored them in their duties. Caring adults like these see young men not just as they are but as they can become. When they talk to or about the young men, they do not dwell on their shortcomings. Instead, they emphasize the great leadership qualities they are demonstrating.

Young men, this is how the Lord sees you. I invite you to see yourself this way. There will be times in your life when you are called upon to lead. At other times, you will be expected to follow. But my message to you today is that regardless of your calling, you are always a leader, and you are always a follower. Leadership is an expression of discipleship—it is simply a matter of helping others come unto Christ, which is what true disciples do. If you are striving to be a follower of Christ, then you can help others follow Him and you can be a leader.

Your ability to lead does not come from an outgoing personality, motivational skills, or even a talent for public speaking. It comes from your commitment to follow Jesus Christ. It comes from your desire to be, in Abraham's words, ""a greater follower of righteousness.""2 If you can do that—even if you aren't perfect at it, but you're trying—then you *are* a leader.",1,

The expectation is that all faithful Latter-day Saints are entitled to the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and personal revelation to aid them in meeting the needs of those they teach, counsel, and serve.

You remember how King Benjamin explained his own leadership role:

""I have not commanded you to come up hither that ye should fear me, or that ye should think that I of myself am more than a mortal man.

""But I am like as yourselves, subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind; yet I have been chosen by this people, and consecrated by my father, and was suffered by the hand of the Lord that I should be a ruler and a king over this people; and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power, to serve you with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord hath granted unto me"" (Mosiah 2:10–11).

Your leader in the Lord's Church may seem to you weak and human or may appear to you strong and inspired. The fact is that every leader is a mixture of those traits and more. What helps servants of the Lord who are called to lead us is when we can see them as the Lord did when He called them.

The Lord sees His servants perfectly. He sees their potential and their future. And He knows how their very nature can be changed. He also knows how they can be changed by their experiences with the people they will lead.

You may have had the experience of being made stronger by the people you were called to serve. I was once called as a bishop of young single adults. I am not sure whether the Lord's purposes were more for what changes I could help Him make in them or the changes He knew they would make in me.

To a degree I do not understand, most of those young people in that ward acted as if I was called of God especially for them. They saw my weaknesses but looked past them.

I remember one young man who asked for counsel about his educational choices. He was a freshman at a very good university. A week after I had given the advice, he scheduled an appointment with me.",1,

However, all Church leaders are encouraged to focus principally on people, to feed the sheep in the Lord's flock, to know and love the members, to listen, love, and help with personal needs. ""It is the leader's duty&#133;to teach the member to love-not the leader or teacher, but the truth of the gospel"" (D. McKay, *IE* 71 [Dec. 1968]:108). To do this, leaders are frequently counseled to seek the spiritual gifts of discernment and wisdom (cf. Luke 12:12; D&C 84:85).

In addition to inspiration, leaders may look to others for training or assistance. A leader may confer with his or her own priesthood leader about a problem or need, especially in one's ""stewardship review""-a one-on-one session with one's organizational leader. These personal interviews are customarily held four times a year, ""for it is required of the Lord, at the hand of every steward, to render an account of his stewardship, both in time and in eternity"" (D&C 72:3).

These handbooks are prepared by and revised periodically by appointed committees and reviewed by the Correlation Committee.

All Church officers are responsible for training those who serve under them. Leadership training or instructional meetings are held regularly for every group of leaders. For example, members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve meet weekly in the Salt Lake Temple for counsel and instruction. These leaders hold training sessions for other General Authorities, who in turn instruct the stake presidents and other stake leaders under their jurisdiction. Stake officers periodically conduct training sessions for ward leaders, who in turn instruct other ward officers under their supervision.

Leaders are given virtual autonomy in the performance of their duties and responsibilities. At the same time, they are charged to follow the principles of the gospel and policies of the Church, and they are enjoined to be mindful of service, gentleness, and humility: ""Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant"" (Matt. 20:27). They are also charged to avoid unrighteous dominion: ""No power or influence can or ought to be maintained&#133;[except] by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned"" (D&C 121:39-42).

Emphasis is placed on the need for leaders to learn their duties: ""Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence&#133;. He that learns not his duty and shows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand"" (D&C 107:99-100).",3,

Those who are called to lead in the ministry of the Master are not called to be chiefs or dictators. They are called to be good shepherds. They are to be constantly training others to take their place and become greater leaders than their teachers. A good leader expects much, inspires greatly, and sets on fire those he is called to lead.

Now, a leader must cause things to happen and lives to be affected. Something should move and change. He must see that those under him do not fail. But it should be done in the Lord's way. He should be the instrument in the hands of the Almighty for changing lives. He needs to know where he is now, where he is going, and how he is going to get there.

A leader must be a good listener. He must be willing to take counsel. He must show a genuine concern and love for those under his stewardship. No priesthood leader can ever be effective unless he has firmly in mind the transcending keys of leadership found in section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants:

""No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;

""By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile—

""Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy"" (D&C 121:41–43).",3,

Some years ago I was traveling in the Rosario Argentina Mission up in the northern part of Argentina. As we were traveling along the road, we passed a large herd of cattle being moved. The herd was moving peaceably and without difficulty. The herd was quiet. There were no dogs. Out in front leading the herd were three gauchos on horseback, each about fifteen or twenty yards apart. These three horsemen were slumped forward in their saddles, completely relaxed, confident that the herd would follow them. At the rear of the herd was a single rider bringing up the rear. He, too, was slumped forward in his saddle as if he were sleeping. The whole herd moved peacefully, quietly, and was subdued. From that experience it seemed obvious to me that leadership is about three-fourths show-the-way and about one-fourth follow-up.",1,

We have been warned and forewarned that if we raise ourselves against the authority which God has placed in the Church for its government, unless we repent, he will withdraw his Spirit from us.

Brethren, if we wish to be guided by the Spirit of the Lord and enjoy his blessings, we must be true to the one who has been chosen as our leader and never murmur, complain, or find fault, or feel that someone else should be in his position. Men in high places, even one of the Three Witnesses, Oliver Cowdery, who had also received the priesthood under the hands of heavenly beings, and then Sidney Rigdon, a counselor in the First Presidency, fell away from the Church because they criticized and questioned the prophet of God.

I pray that we may all remain true to the faith, support, sustain, and follow the one who has been chosen by God as our leader. As we do this, we will be blessed and the Spirit of the Lord will linger with us and with our families as we teach and encourage them to be faithful and active. God's work will be accomplished and his will will be done. As the Lord has said of his prophet:

""For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.

""For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's glory.

The first step involves the selection of those to be called. For example, the presiding authority (the stake president or bishop) is to thoughtfully and prayerfully evaluate possible candidates for each office or teaching responsibility. Other leaders who eventually will be working closely with the person may be asked to suggest the names of a few candidates they think could serve ably. Newly called presidents of quorums or auxiliaries are given the right and responsibility of submitting the names of those they wish to be their counselors, and unless there are problems of availability or worthiness, such candidates are given priority. Personal worthiness, ability, willingness to serve, individual and family circumstances, whether the calling would benefit those being served, and the possible impact on the lives of the member and the member's family are to be considered carefully. The prime consideration for a leader in selecting a person for a calling is confirmation by the Holy Ghost of the correctness of the final selection. When leaders select members to fulfill callings in this manner, members understand that callings have divine approval.

The second step involved in extending a call requires the authorized leader to hold a private interview with the member to issue and explain the calling. When a wife, husband, or child is to receive a call, it is recommended that the husband, wife, or parents of the candidate be consulted regarding the calling. Support by family members of the one who is receiving a call is an important consideration.",3,

Leadership does not always produce a harmonious symphony of faith, skills, and talents of the group, producing maximum effectiveness and power. It is sometimes a loud solo.

(Ezra 7:10.) As Saints of the latter days, we are grateful for a modern-day Ezra, even our beloved prophet, Ezra Taft Benson, who, like Ezra of old, has prepared himself to receive the word of the Lord and is prepared to do the Lord's will. I bear you my witness that there is a living prophet in Israel today.

Another great leader who continually sought the will of the Lord was the Prophet Joseph Smith. His very life exemplified Paul's admonition to live the gospel that we preach. (See 1 Cor. 9:14.) A great strength of the Prophet was his ability to delegate and develop leadership skills in those around him. The expedition of Zion's Camp is but one example of Joseph's leadership based upon the principle ""Come Follow Me."" (See Luke 18:22.) At the conclusion of Zion's Camp, the Prophet gave the newly organized high council detailed instructions regarding their callings and then told them, ""If I should now be taken away, I [have] accomplished the great work the Lord [has] laid before me."" (*History of the Church,* 2:124.) Long before his martyrdom the Prophet Joseph was diligently training those who would continue to lead the kingdom after he was gone. Here is another important lesson of leadership: *Leaders are duty-bound and obligated to prepare others to take their place* at some future time. Brothers and sisters, the cemeteries are filled with leaders who thought they were indispensable.",1,

The teachings contained in the Book of Mormon regarding the purpose of baptism are unique and exceptional in all of ancient scripture for their clarity, specificity and consistency. In contrast to biblical descriptions of baptism, the Book of Mormon provides profound insight into the covenantal nature of this ordinance, what the individual is signaling to God when he or she chooses to be baptized, and the way in which God responds to the believer's commitment.

Furthermore, the Book of Mormon demonstrates how the act of baptism fits into the larger picture of the ""doctrine"" and ""gospel"" of Christ. One may be led to assume, without the teachings contained in the Book of Mormon, that the act of baptism, on its own, can provide the believer with a remission of sins. However, the teachings of the Book of Mormon indicate that baptism is one part of an organic whole that includes faith, repentance, baptism, the reception of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. The text makes clear that baptism without repentance or the purifying effect of the Holy Ghost is not enough to wash away sins. As Noel Reynolds noted:

> A surprising implication of this Book of Mormon language is that the covenant the convert signals at baptism is actually made before baptism and is the central element of repentance. Genuine repentance always includes a deliberate commitment by the penitent person to turn to Christ and walk in his path—taking his name upon oneself and keeping his commandments. Baptism and repentance are thus linked together: baptism completes repentance.

As 2 Nephi 31:7 states, ""But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments."" In fact, in the ancient world, the swearing of an oath, the bearing of a testimony in court, or the making of a contract or covenant was often accompanied by outward gestures, submission to an ordeal, and the invocation of the name of the god who would attest to its enforcement.

Subsequent narratives regarding the ordinance of baptism in the Book of Mormon decisively follow this precedent. When Alma baptizes his followers at the waters of Mormon, he emphasizes the fact that their baptism serves ""as a witness before [God] that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you"" (Mosiah 18:10). The first baptism he performs, for the man Helam, includes the words: ""I baptize thee … as a testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until you are dead"" (Mosaiah 18:13).",3,

The accounts of baptisms performed shortly before Jesus' ministry among the Nephites confirm that this reason for baptism—""as a witness and a testimony before God""—was perpetuated until the time of Christ (3 Nephi 7:25). One of the most important of Christ's actions during his visit to the Nephites was the establishment of the ordinance of the Sacrament. Jesus' own teachings regarding the purpose of the Sacrament (3 Nephi 18:7, 10–11) as well as the words of the sacramental prayers (as recorded in Moroni 4–5), according to Reynolds, ""precisely recapitulate the converts' witnessing to the Father, renewing their prior witness of the covenant they had made to take upon themselves the name of Christ, to keep his commandments, and to remember him always.""",2,

No other book of ancient scripture makes this point as clearly.

Alma and his people, wherever they were, made finding sources of ""pure water"" a priority (Mosiah 23:4). This suggests that Alma and his people recognized how important baptism and spiritual purity would be in building up the Church of Christ in their new land.

What may not be immediately clear to readers is that Alma's description of the baptismal covenant is tied into the atonement of Jesus Christ—in that he asked recent converts to imitate Christ's perfect love—charity. Such ""love"" is reflected in the Egyptian meaning of *Mormon*, and is also at the heart of what it means to be a Latter-day Saint—or ""Mormon,"" as some might say. Alma asks his followers to, like Christ, love one another by suffering vicariously the pains of others and having compassion on those who are in need of help and comfort. This is what the Savior does for us, and what we commit to do for others.5, 362."")

When we renew our covenants as we partake of the Sacrament, we have the opportunity to remember what Christ has done for us through His love and atoning sacrifice.

Likewise, excommunicants undergo baptism again once they have qualified for readmission into the Church.

The form of the ordinance is prescribed in latter-day revelation, which makes clear that the baptism must be performed by a person who has priesthood authority and that it requires completely immersing the penitent candidate below the water and then bringing the person out of the water (3 Ne. 11:25-26; D&C 20:72-74). Baptism is followed by the laying-on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.

Contemporary Church practice provides for the candidate to be interviewed and approved by an authorized priesthood official (usually the bishop or other officer presiding over the congregation or a mission official), who determines whether the applicant meets the qualifying conditions of repentance, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and an understanding of and willingness to obey the laws and ordinances of the gospel. It is also necessary that an official record of each baptism be kept by the Church.

Baptism may be performed in the font provided in many meetinghouses or in any body of water that is suitable for the sacred occasion and deep enough for complete immersion. The candidate and the person performing the ordinance will be dressed in plain and modest white clothing. The ceremony is unpretentious, typically attended by the candidate's family, close friends, and interested members of the congregation. A speaker or two may offer a few words of instruction and joyous welcome to the candidate.

The earlier practice of rebaptism to manifest repentance and recommitment, or for a restoration of health in time of sickness, is no longer practiced in the Church.",1,

In the Book of Mormon, Nephi, the son of Lehi clarifies what it meant for Jesus to ""fulfill all righteousness."" Nephi explained that even though Jesus was perfect, by being baptized He ""showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments."" (2 Nephi 31:7).

Jesus did not need a remission of his sins because he was without sin, but by being baptized, he showed his humility, and willingly made a sacred covenant to do the will of His Father. In this way, He showed us what our Heavenly Father wants all of us to do.

In addition to teaching us why Jesus needed to be baptized, The Book of Mormon also plainly and distinctively teaches that baptism is a sacred witness and covenant that we make with God, that we are willing to trust in our Savior, and keep his commandments. Being submerged symbolizes the burial of our old selves. Coming up out of the water represents our being raised up into a new stage of life as we promise to follow our Savior.

Baptism puts believers on the covenant path and is an outward sign of our commitment to Heavenly Father. This unique doctrine is taught many times throughout the Book of Mormon. For example, Alma taught at the Waters of Mormon that baptism serves ""as a witness before [God] that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments"" (Mosiah 18:10). Nephi, son of Nephi, also confirmed that baptism acts ""as a witness and a testimony before God"" (3 Nephi 7:25). Because of the covenantal nature of baptism, the Book of Mormon also strongly states that little children are not to be baptized.",3,

I was eight years of age. My parents taught me and my brothers the significance of this great ordinance. My mother told me that after my baptism I would be held accountable for the things I did that were not right. I remember the day of my baptism very vividly. I was baptized in the baptismal font in the Tabernacle on Temple Square. Those who were being baptized put on white coveralls and one by one were gently taken down the steps into the water. One of the children baptized that day was not totally immersed, and so the ordinance was repeated. This was necessary because, as the scriptures indicate, ""baptism symbolizes death, burial, and resurrection, and can only be done by immersion.""1 It also follows the pattern set by the Savior, who was baptized in the river Jordan, where there was much water. As Matthew records, ""And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water.""2

Even though I was only eight years of age, the words of the baptismal prayer penetrated deeply into my soul. After repeating my name, Brother Irvin G.

In the Book of Mormon, the one baptized makes a solemn commitment to follow Christ and thereafter keep His commandments, just as the early Christian converts to whom Peter wrote had promised to do.

Previous to baptism, converts in the Book of Mormon were questioned about their desires and willingness to serve God before making that commitment. And after being baptized and receiving a remission of their sins, those baptized were expected to continue to witness before God and the people that they were truly repentant and that they sought to pattern their lives after the Savior. Both the Bible and the Book of Mormon teach the same Gospel including the importance of the baptismal covenant. This scriptural consistency with the Bible reflects Mormon's stated purposed for the Book of Mormon: it was ""written for the intent that ye may believe that [the Bible]; and if ye believe that ye will believe this [the Book of Mormon] also"" (Mormon 7:9).",3,

In the ancient world, baptism and other rituals for cleansing were required to be done with ""pure water"" (see Hebrews 10:22; cf. Ezekiel 36:25), which is likely why Mosiah 18:5 specifies this aspect of the waters of Mormon. When Alma and his people fled from King Noah into another land, they chose their new home based on the fact that it was also ""a land of pure water"" (Mosiah 23:4).

When Alma began to baptize people, he declared that their baptism would be ""a witness before [the Lord] that ye have entered into a covenant with him"" (Mosiah 18:10,13).

As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ""we believe … the Book of Mormon to be the word of God."" (A of F 1:8.) God has so declared it, so have its writers, so have its witnesses, and so do all those who have read it and received a personal revelation from God as to its truthfulness.

In section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord says that he gave Joseph Smith ""power from on high … to translate the Book of Mormon; Which contains … the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ … ; Which was given by inspiration."" (D&C 20:8–10.)",0,

Have you ever wondered why there are so many Christian churches in the world today when they obtain their doctrines from essentially the same Bible? It is because they interpret the Bible differently. If they interpreted it the same, they would be the same church. This is not a condition the Lord desires, for the Apostle Paul declared that there is ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism"" (Ephesians 4:5). To help bring this oneness about, the Lord established a divine law of witnesses. Paul taught, ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Corinthians 13:1).

The Bible is one witness of Jesus Christ; the Book of Mormon is another. Why is this second witness so crucial? The following illustration may help: How many straight lines can you draw through a single point on a piece of paper? The answer is infinite. For a moment, suppose that single point represents the Bible and that hundreds of those straight lines drawn through that point represent different interpretations of the Bible and that each of those interpretations represents a different church.

What happens, however, if on that piece of paper there is a second point representing the Book of Mormon? How many straight lines could you draw between these two reference points: the Bible and the Book of Mormon? Only one. Only one interpretation of Christ's doctrines survives the testimony of these two witnesses.",2,

It accepts the Bible ""as the foremost of [the Church's] standard works, first among the books which have been proclaimed as&#133;written guides in faith and doctrine. In the respect and sanctity with which the Latter-day Saints regard the Bible they are of like profession with Christian denominations in general"" (*AF*, 1966 ed., p. 236).

Latter-day Saints value the Bible for many reasons. The Bible presents the revelations of God in several dispensations or eras, each headed by prophets. They also read and follow the Bible for the instructional and spiritual value of the events it describes. While some of the Old Testament describes the Law of Moses that Latter-day Saints believe was fulfilled with the Atonement of Christ (3 Ne. 9:17), nevertheless the Old Testament stories, commandments, ordinances, proverbs, and prophetic writings still express the basic patterns of God's will toward his children and how they should act toward him.

Latter-day Saints revere the New Testament for its account of the birth, ministry, Atonement, and resurrection of the Savior, Jesus Christ. The teachings of Jesus in the New Testament comprise the core of LDS doctrine, and their preeminence is evidenced by their frequent appearance in other LDS standard works accepted as scripture and in LDS speaking and writing.

The writings of the New Testament apostles are accepted and appreciated for their doctrine and wise and inspired counsel and for documenting the apostolic challenge of proclaiming the gospel, adhering to the original teachings of Christ, establishing the unity of the faith, and promoting the righteousness of believers in a rapidly growing Church. Latter-day Saints also find references in several letters of the early apostles of the falling away (see Apostasy) that necessitated the restoration, alerting the faithful to remain fervent and active in the faith and to stay true to the love of Jesus Christ.",3,

However, there are two indispensable elements. One must ""ask with a *sincere heart,* with *real intent,*"" and then God ""will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.""4

Strong evidence besides the Book of Mormon corroborates the claims of Joseph Smith. To begin with, the Three Witnesses and the Eight Witnesses, who handled the plates and saw the engravings, testified that the Book of Mormon was translated by the power of God. Members of Joseph Smith's family, who knew him best, also accepted and believed his message. Among the believers were his parents, his brothers and his sisters, and his uncle John Smith. His older brother Hyrum proved his complete faith in Joseph's work by giving his life along with Joseph. These reliable witnesses all confirm the Prophet's testimony.",0,

(History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 4:461.)

We believe the Bible to be the word of God, but I have often asked missionaries what they would do without the Book of Mormon and modern revelation. With just the Bible, what would be their approach? The Prophet Joseph answered it. ""Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations and where is our religion? We have none."" (HC, 2:52.)

If the Book of Mormon is not true, then Joseph Smith was not a prophet of God. I testify to you that the Book of Mormon is true and that the revelations contained in the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price and other places are true and of the Lord. Our message to the world is that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that God has revealed himself to man in this dispensation and restored his gospel with all its keys and power. Nothing will be more certain to build faith and testimonies of members and touch the hearts of honest seekers for the truth than this great book.

There is a special power about the Book of Mormon. It bears a strong, silent witness of its truth as one reads it.

Parley P. Pratt stated, ""The Spirit of the Lord came upon me, while I read [The Book of Mormon], and enlightened my mind, convinced my judgment, and rivetted the truth upon my understanding, so that I knew that the book was true, just as well as a man knows the daylight from the dark night."" (Journal of Discourses, 5:194.)

Brigham Young said as he read the book, ""I knew it was true, as well as I knew that I could see with my eyes, or feel by the touch of my fingers, or be sensible of the demonstration of any sense."" (JD, 3:91.)",3,

For example, some people are confused as to whether baptism is essential for salvation even though the Savior declared to Nicodemus, ""Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God"" (John 3:5). The Book of Mormon, however, eliminates all doubt on that subject: ""And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptized in his name, … or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God"" (2 Nephi 9:23).

There exist various modes of baptisms in the world today even though the Bible tells us the manner in which the Savior, our great Exemplar, was baptized: ""[He] went up straightway out of the water"" (Matthew 3:16). Could He have come up out of the water unless He first went down into the water? Lest there be any discord on this subject, the Book of Mormon dispels it with this straightforward statement of doctrine as to the proper manner of baptism: ""And then shall ye immerse them in the water"" (3 Nephi 11:26).",2,

But one incorrect doctrine such as this is like a domino set in motion that causes the fall of other dominoes or, in this case, the fall of correct doctrines. A belief in the cessation of revelation causes the doctrine that ""God is the same yesterday, today, and forever"" (Mormon 9:9) to fall; it causes the doctrine taught by Amos that ""surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets"" (Amos 3:7) to fall; and it causes the doctrine that ""God is no respecter of persons"" (Acts 10:34) and thus speaks to all men of all ages to fall. But fortunately the Book of Mormon reenthrones the biblical truth of continuous revelation:

""And again, I speak unto you who deny the revelations of God, and say that they are done away, that there are no revelations. …

""Do we not read that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever … ?"" (Mormon 9:7, 9).

Then read the Book of Mormon. It will teach you and testify to you that Christ's Atonement is infinite because it circumscribes and encompasses and transcends every finite frailty known to man. That is why the prophet Mormon declared, ""Ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ"" (Moroni 7:41).

No wonder the Book of Mormon proclaims with boldness, ""And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ"" (2 Nephi 33:10). Together with the Bible, the Book of Mormon is an indispensable witness of the doctrines of Christ and His divinity. Together with the Bible, it ""teach[es] all men that they should do good"" (2 Nephi 33:10). And together with the Bible, it brings us to ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism.""

To members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Book of Mormon forms the doctrinal foundation of the Church and speaks the word of God to all the world.

The Book of Mormon both confirms and supplements the Bible: ""Behold, this [the Book of Mormon] is written for the intent that ye may believe that [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe [the Book of Mormon] also"" (Morm. 7:9). The Bible is primarily a record of God's dealings with the forebears and descendants of Jacob or Israel in the ancient Near East. Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of God's dealings principally with another group of Israelites he brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem about 600 B.C. (see Lehi). They anticipated the birth and coming of Jesus Christ and believed in his Atonement and gospel. Their complex, lengthy records were abridged by a prophet named Mormon, inscribed on plates of gold, and buried by his son, Moroni 2, after internecine wars destroyed all of the believers in Christ in the New World except Moroni (A.D. 385).",2,

See also Doctrine and Covenants 1:24. For more on this idea, see Book of Mormon Central, ""Why Does the Lord Speak to Men 'According the Their Language' (2 Nephi 31:3),"" KnoWhy 258 (January 6, 2017)."")

First, it tells in a plain manner of Christ and his gospel. It testifies of his divinity and of the necessity for a Redeemer and the need of our putting trust in him. It bears witness of the Fall and the Atonement and the first principles of the gospel, including our need of a broken heart and a contrite spirit and a spiritual rebirth. It proclaims we must endure to the end in righteousness and live the moral life of a Saint.

Second, the Book of Mormon exposes the enemies of Christ. It confounds false doctrines and lays down contention. (See 2 Ne. 3:12.) It fortifies the humble followers of Christ against the evil designs, strategies, and doctrines of the devil in our day. The type of apostates in the Book of Mormon are similar to the type we have today. God, with his infinite foreknowledge, so molded the Book of Mormon that we might see the error and know how to combat false educational, political, religious, and philosophical concepts of our time.

Now God expects us to use the Book of Mormon in several ways. We are to read it ourselves—carefully, prayerfully—and ponder as we read, as to whether this book is the work of God or of an unlearned youth. And then when we are finished reading the things in the book, Moroni exhorts us to put them to the test in these words:

""And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.""

God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ revealed themselves to Joseph Smith in a marvelous vision. After that glorious event, Joseph Smith told a minister about it. Joseph was surprised to hear the minister say that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days, that all such things had ceased. (See JS—H 1:21.)

This remark symbolizes practically all of the objections that have ever been made against the Church by nonmembers and dissident members alike. Namely, they do not believe that God reveals his will today to the Church through prophets of God. All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage, seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation. Here, then, is a procedure to handle most objections through the use of the Book of Mormon.

First, understand the objection.

Second, give the answer from revelation.

Third, show how the correctness of the answer really depends on whether or not we have modern revelation through modern prophets.

Fourth, explain that whether or not we have modern prophets and revelation really depends on whether the Book of Mormon is true.

Therefore, the only problem the objector has to resolve for himself is whether the Book of Mormon is true. For if the Book of Mormon is true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a prophet receiving revelation.",0,

Then later they were sent up into Idaho, where a sawmill and a gristmill were needing to be built. My father's family had settled in Farmington, Utah, part of this colonization that I'm referring to—the colonization that made people stronger and gave them opportunities. Rather than being lost in a big city, they were asked to move to a smaller community where they could develop their ability and where there would be more schools and a need for more schoolteachers and where people with talent would develop their ability. Out of all of this, my family were asked to leave Farmington and Tooele, to sell their green acres, and go out into southern Idaho, where there was nothing at that time but sagebrush.

In a little settlement of that kind, my mother and father fell in love. By the time they were 20 years old and ready to be married, where would they be married? In the Logan Utah Temple. How would they get there? By buggy. How long would it take? Well, five or six or seven days. Highways and good roads? Of course not. They went by roads made by wagons going over the sagebrush and through the bushes and over the rocks. Where would they be married? Where would they be sealed? Only one place—the temple.

That became part of my heritage. And so people grew up in these little towns. Then the Church decided to open some academies, and they opened some 30 of them out in these areas far away.

Religious persecution of the 1830s and 1840s in the more populated eastern states necessitated the movement of the Latter-day Saints to the West, where they could be more isolated. The Prophet Joseph Smith had designated Jackson County, Missouri, on the fringes of civilization, as the Zion of the latter days. However, continued persecution in Ohio, in Missouri, and later in Illinois caused the Latter-day Saints to seek a refuge in the Rocky Mountains, farther to the west, where they could worship God and practice their religious beliefs in the absence of religious bigotry, in land claimed by Mexico. To approximately 80,000 LDS pioneers who gathered from many nations and traveled across the great American desert by wagons before the advent in 1869 of the railroad, and to the thousands who followed afterward, the LDS presence in the Salt Lake Valley was compared to a fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy of the latter days, the City of God, established in the top of the mountains where people from all nations could gather to the House of the Lord to learn his ways (Isa. 2:1-3). To the Latter-day pioneers, President Brigham Young's words expressed their feelings: ""This is the place.""

The seventeen-mile-wide by twenty-five-mile-long Salt Lake Valley is some 4,500 feet above sea level and is surrounded by towering mountain peaks of the Wasatch Range that rise to over 11,000 feet. The valley is part of the Great Basin, where river waters are kept from flowing into the Pacific Ocean by high mountains. Lake Bonneville once lay within the Great Basin, and geologists say that it measured 1,000 feet deep where Salt Lake City is now located. The current Great Salt Lake is the evaporation remnant of that inland sea.",3,

If they wanted statehood, which they did and which Brigham felt very strongly about, they couldn't pass any anti-slavery laws.

The specific intent of the slavery laws in Utah (there were two, one for black people and one for Native Americans, passed within a month of each other) was to eventually lead to the complete elimination of slavery. Slavery in Utah was a step between the slavery of the South and indentured servitude.

There were some differences between the two laws, but basically, slaves had to come into the territory willingly and couldn't be sold or forced to move out of the territory if they didn't want to be. There were term limits on the contracts and education was required for all slaves. If masters slept with their slaves, even if it was consensual, or they neglected to feed, clothe, or shelter them, or if they abused the slaves, the contracts were null and void and the slaves were to be freed. There were also fines and potential prison sentences for the masters if they violated their contacts. There were legal recourses for the slaves and term limits imposed, which was very different from Southern slavery, and more akin to indentured servitude.

Obviously, some people abused these laws and looked for loopholes and other people were treated very badly, but the intent was to be better than those in the South and to eventually eliminate the practice from the territory.",1,

In order to become an official territory in 1850, they were neutral as to slavery: they had no laws establishing it or denying it. However, depending on the Missouri Compromise, they might have been required to be a slave state if they were granted statehood. It all depended on the timing of other states being approved. Making things even more complicated, some of the Saints had slaves when they joined the main body of the Church in Utah. The leaders weren't sure what to do with them. The Native Americans also had a bustling slave trade going between the local tribes and dealers in Mexico, and they were conducting it right there in the middle of Utah Territory. It was a tangled mess they had to try to organize.

By 1852, it was becoming critical for the Territorial government to pass some laws regarding slavery in Utah. President Young, as the governor, gave a series of speeches in front of the legislature in January and February, alternating with Orson Pratt in sort of a debate where they'd each take a turn and voice their opinions.

Salt Lake City, in the north end of the valley, became the ""big city,"" the headquarters of the Church. But as immigrants gathered from far-flung countries to their Zion, numerous smaller towns were established in the valley along the mountain streams.

With the coming of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, Gentiles (non-Mormons) began to move into the valley, diluting the LDS population; but Latter-day Saints continued to be a majority. The railroad helped foster more manufacturing, mining, and commerce, and the valley took on a decided change. By 1870 modern houses were replacing the log and adobe brick cabins, and green trees lined the streets and roads. Farms were fenced and well groomed.

The 1880s saw the introduction of the telephone and electricity to Salt Lake City, and in 1893 the Salt Lake Temple was finished.

* + It is a star.1
 + It is a ""great [star]"" and a ""governing one.""
 + It is ""near unto [God]"" or ""nigh unto the throne of God.""
 + It was used to tell relative time (""one revolution [of Kolob] was a day unto the Lord, after his manner of reckoning, it being one thousand years according to the time appointed unto that whereon thou [Abraham] standest"").
 + It ""signify[ed] the first creation, nearest to the celestial, or the residence of God. First in government, the last pertaining to the measurement of time. The measurement according to celestial time, which celestial time signifies one day to a cubit.""

Latter-day Saints have long been interested in Kolob for its doctrinal and potential cosmological significance.2 The opening words to the beloved Latter-day Saint hymn ""If You Could Hie to Kolob"" written by W. W. Phelps was, of course, inspired by Kolob in the Book of Abraham.3

In recent years, spurred on by promising discoveries in Egyptology and Near Eastern archaeology, some Latter-day Saint scholars have sought to situate Kolob in the ancient world. Although there are still many uncertainties, a few points in favor of Kolob being authentically ancient can be affirmed with reasonable plausibility.",3,

One of the more common proposals is that the name derives from the Semitic root *qlb*, meaning ""heart, center, middle,"" and is thus related to the root *qrb*, meaning ""to be near, close.""4 This explanation is enticing because it works well as a pun on the name provided for Kolob within the Book of Abraham itself: ""the name of the great one is Kolob [*qlb*; ""middle, center""], because it is near [*qrb*] unto me [i.e. the Lord]"" (Abraham 3:3).5 The drawback to this theory, however, is that *qlb* as a Semitic word is only attested as far back as Arabic, which is considerably later than Abraham's time.6 That being said, there are conjectural Afroasiatic roots that could potentially place this word in Abraham's day.7

Another promising proposal is that Kolob derives from the Semitic root *klb*, meaning ""dog.""8 This theory has been circulating since at least the early twentieth century, when a non-Latter-day Saint named James E. Homans (writing under the pseudonym R. C. Webb) postulated this idea in 1913.9 This, in turn, has prompted some to identify Kolob with Sirius, the dog-star.10 Known as Sopdet (or Sothis in Greek) in ancient Egypt, Sirius held both mythological as well as calendrical significance to the ancient Egyptians. Usually associated with the goddesses Isis and Hathor, the star Sirius ""had a special role because its heliacal rising coincided with the ideal Egyptian New Year day that was linked with the onset of the Nile inundation.""11

Both Sirius and Kolob share a number of overlapping characteristics, including:

* + Both are associated with the throne of God.12
 + Both are recognized as the ""greatest"" (probably meaning brightest) of stars.13
 + Both are depicted as governing other stars.14

> The ancient Egyptians associated the idea of encircling something (whether in the sky or on earth) with controlling or governing it, and the same terms are used for both. Thus, the Book of Abraham notes that ""there shall be the reckoning of the time of one planet above another, until thou come nigh unto Kolob, . . . which Kolob is set nigh unto the throne of God, to *govern* all those planets which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest"" (Abraham 3:9; emphasis added). The Egyptians had a similar notion, in which the sun (*Re*) was not only a god but the head of all the gods and ruled over everything that he encircled. Abraham's astronomy sets the sun, ""that which is to rule the day"" (Abraham 3:5), as greater than the moon but less than Kolob, which governs the sun (Abraham 3:9). Thus, in the astronomy of the Book of Abraham, Kolob, which is the nearest star to God (Abraham 3:16; see also 3, 9), revolves around and thus encircles or controls the sun, which is the head of the Egyptian pantheon.19

In any case, Kolob is said to govern the planets (celestial bodies) below it. Kolob can thus rightly be seen as a type of Christ, the Master of the cosmos in close concert with His Father (see Doctrine and Covenants 45:1; 76:23–24; Moses 1:33; 2:1). 3:11–12 Abraham's theophany. As Enoch (Moses 7:4; Doctrine and Covenants 107:49) before him and Jacob (Genesis 32:30) and Moses (Exodus 33:11; Moses 1:2, 31) after, Abraham receives a dramatic theophany (compare 2:6). The parallel language with Moses's theophany on the mount is especially striking. Abra- ham the seer. A Leitmotif running through this chapter is a depiction of Abraham as a seer: Abraham sees or is otherwise shown celestial bodies, spirits (or intelligences), God Himself, and the premortal council (Abraham 3:2, 6, 11–12, 15–16, 21–22). Furthermore, the Lord in- structs the heavenly council to will wait and see if the premortal intelligences will do all things they are commanded on earth (3:25). This echoes a Leitmotif in Genesis where Abraham sees the Lord and the land of his inheritance (see Genesis 12:1, 7; 13:15). 3:13 Names of celestial objects. Here the Lord shows Abraham various celestial bodies and gives them names. Shine- hah is plausibly attested as a name for the sun's ecliptic in Egyptian texts from Abraham's day

Actually the Hebrew word Kolob might mean heart or center, it even comes from the word Caleb in Hebrew actually means God, because a god is somebody who's nearby to you or center to you, so it's interesting how these words – even Kokaubeam is a Hebrew word that means the stars.

Kolob, signifying the first creation, near- est to the celestial, or the residence of God. First in government, the last pertaining to the measure- ment of time. The measurement according to celes- tial time, which celestial time signifies one day to a cubit. One day in Kolob is equal to a thousand years according to the measurement of this earth, which is called by the Egyptians Jah-oh-eh.

Kolob features prominently in the cosmology of the book of Abraham as a star or planet nearest to the residence of God (see Abraham 3:3–10). As with the explanation to this figure, Kolob in the text of the book of Abraham is said to have timekeeping significance (Abraham 3:9). The comment that ce- lestial time ""signifies one day to a cubit"" is perplexing, but perhaps is meant to describe angular velocity, or the speed at which an object revolves relative to another object (in this case the orbits of celestial bodies). According to this understanding, the movement of Kolob (assuming it is intended to be a physical star in the visible night sky; see the commentary accompanying Abraham 3:3) is being measured in cubits, an anciently attested phenome- non for other celestial bodies. In its Egyptian context this figure is commonly identified in other hypocephali as the god Amun (or Amun-Re), a supreme- ly important deity in ancient Egypt as the primeval, self-generating creator god whose name means ""hidden one"" (ỉmn). Although usually depicted in hypocephali with four heads, representing the universality and totality of this god's power over the cosmic elements, here the figure has two heads, as also attested in other hypocephali. He holds what appears to be the Egyp- tian wꜢs-scepter, indicating his lordly dominion.

It's Priesthood power.

 This refers to an explanation given for an item in Book of Abraham Facsimile 2. The description is symbolic, and is not referring to ""photons.""
### Logical Fallacy: Argument from Ignorance—The author has difficulty understanding the topic, so he or she assumes that it simply must not have any validity.

* Question: Does the Book of Abraham state that the sun gets its photons from Kolob?

* 1. Reporting the event as having happened. 2. Relating the event in the witness's own words while disclosing the author's belief that the witness's account is truthful. 3. Stating that the person who reported the event believed that it happened. 4. Relating the event but implying that it probably did not happen. 5–6. Ignoring the event, or distorting it, or stating that it did not happen. If Elder Oaks believed the letter was genuine, he would have reported its delivery under the parameters of Section 1 - reporting this event as having happened. It would therefore be ""a letter Martin Harris sent to W.W. Phelps."" But it was, instead, a letter ""Martin Harris is supposed to have sent."" This, at best, falls into category 4. The best that can be said is that Elder Oaks was open to the possibility that the Salamander Letter could have been genuine, but his bias, as defined within the talk, was firmly against authenticity.",3,

The other two documents that were embarrassing were the Joseph Smith III blessing, where Joseph Smith, Jr. supposedly selected his son as his successor, and the Josiah Stowell note, which confirmed that Joseph was a treasure seeker, which was already confirmed in Joseph's original history. Hofmann said in an interview that he was confident the Church would be eager to ""buy the blessing on the spot and bury it,"" i.e. purchase and suppress. The Church did nothing of the kind and initially turned Hofmann away. Later, after negotiations with the RLDS Church to buy the JS III blessing fell through, the Church entered into a new round of discussions with Hofmann and agreed to a non-cash trade to secure the fake blessing, which they then offered at no cost to the Reorganized Church. The Church immediately made the content of the letter public.

That's a pretty lousy job of suppression.

They were, Mormon says, ""poor as to things of the world; and also … poor in heart""13—two conditions that almost always go together.

Our burden of taxes would be lightened. The giver would not suffer but would be blessed by his small abstinence.

Joseph and Hyrum, meanwhile, went to their deaths nobly and with a clear conscience (D&C 135:4). In the immediate wake of their deaths, John Taylor wrote:

> Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. In the short space of twenty years, he has brought forth the Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift and power of God, and has been the means of publishing it on two continents; has sent the fulness of the everlasting gospel, which it contained, to the four quarters of the earth; has brought forth the revelations and commandments which compose this book of Doctrine and Covenants, and many other wise documents and instructions for the benefit of the children of men; gathered many thousands of the Latter-day Saints, founded a great city, and left a fame and name that cannot be slain. He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the Lord's anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood; and so has his brother Hyrum. In life they were not divided, and in death they were not separated! (D&C 135:3)

Oaks (a legal scholar before being called as an apostle) and Marvin S. Hill wrote, ""The murder of Joseph and Hyrum Smith at Carthage, Illinois, was not a spontaneous, impulsive act by a few personal enemies of the Mormon leaders, but a deliberate political assassination, committed or condoned by some of the leading citizens in Hancock County.""13, 46."") Nauvoo was the largest city in Illinois at the time, and Joseph was the mayor and a presidential candidate.14; Derek R. Sainsbury, Storming the Nation: The Unknown Contributions of Joseph Smith's Political Missionaries (Provo, UT: BYU Religious Studies Center; Salt Lake City, UT: Deseret Book, 2020)."") Hyrum was vice mayor and running for office in the state legislature. Politically, they were ""two of the most influential men in Illinois"" at the time.15 As such, their assassinations are not only important to Latter-day Saint history, but also the history of the state of Illinois.

The men who colluded together to kill Joseph and Hyrum had a diverse and complex set of motives for their actions—thus understanding *why* these two influential leaders were murdered is complex and involves numerous different factors. As Bentley explains:

> Many factors contributed to the Prophet's murder on June 27, 1844. Among these were fear of the Nauvoo Legion's power; perceived abuses related to powers granted under the Nauvoo Charter; political unrest caused by the rapidly increasing Mormon population in Hancock County, Illinois, and Lee County, Iowa; economic competition with some of the leading Mormon opponents; persisting grudges among some Missourians; rumors distorting the beginnings of the limited practice of plural marriage; criticism of Joseph Smith's presidential campaign; and the concentration of legislative, judicial, executive, military, and religious power in one man, Joseph Smith.16

At one point, Dan Jones overheard the leaders of this group ""say that they did not expect to prove anything against [Joseph], but that they had eighteen accusations against him, and that as one failed they would try another to detain him"" in Carthage.3: 97."") Once they were detained, anti-Mormon mobs whipped up into a frenzy by the charged rhetoric published by Sharp and others would seize the opportunity to execute the Prophet and his brother in an act of what they perceived as ""vigilante justice.""

This plan was put into action as early as February 26, 1844, when the Law brothers and their collaborators instituted or appealed a series of lawsuits to Carthage. Already at this point, Joseph suspected a darker plot at work than merely resolving legal differences.4 After those lawsuits were consolidated and dismissed, the dissenters initiated additional legal suits in May. Eventually, some of these were successful in getting Joseph out of Nauvoo, and thus he was in Carthage on May 27, 1844, exactly one month before his martyrdom. On that occasion, Charles Foster—one of the conspirators—evidently had a temporary change of heart and notified Joseph of a plan to have him assassinated the next day. With this advance notice, Joseph was able to muster ""enough well-armed troops … from Nauvoo to guarantee Joseph's protection,"" and he subsequently returned home safely.5",1,

This was not a spontaneous or unexpected event—Joseph himself anticipated that he went ""as a lamb to the slaughter"" (Doctrine and Covenants 135:4) and had in fact feared for his life for at least several months, perhaps longer. And he had good reason to fear—there was, in fact, a murderous plot to have him and his brother kidnapped and killed.

According to the recent analysis of legal scholar Joseph I. Bentley, the key Nauvoo apostates were a trio of brothers, William and Wilson Law, Robert and Charles Foster, and Francis and Chauncey Higbee. They colluded with prominent anti-Mormons such as Thomas Sharp, a newspaper editor in the nearby town of Warsaw, Illinois. Whether or not they hatched ""a well-planned conspiracy,"" Bentley argues, ""they undoubtedly went forward, acting deliberately and concertedly.""1: 26."")

In reaction to this threat, Joseph declared martial law in Nauvoo, calling out the Nauvoo Legion to protect the city from invasion. The threatened invasion never came, and after Governor Ford met with Joseph's enemies in Warsaw and Carthage, he insisted that Joseph come to Carthage to stand trial yet again for the riot charge. The Governor guaranteed Joseph that he would be protected. However, he insisted on disarming the Nauvoo Legion in order to keep the peace, but did not disarm the other militias at the same time.

Once in Carthage, Joseph and other defendants were arraigned on the riot charge and posted bail when the Higbees deliberately failed to present witnesses and asked for their case to be rescheduled for September. Before Joseph and Hyrum could leave Carthage, however, they were charged with treason for having declared martial law—yet another legal charge that lacked any legal merit, but was useful because treason was a non-bailable offense. This prevented Joseph and Hyrum from leaving, and left them trapped in Carthage Jail, vulnerable to mob action.

Inside the jail, Hyrum read from the book of Ether in the Book of Mormon and Joseph bore a strong testimony to the guards of the truthfulness of the Restoration, of the Book of Mormon, and of the visitations of angels. Outside, the mob, eventually numbering about 2,000, was able to mobilize, with people standing ready to join from Missouri, and then come to Carthage and assassinate Joseph and Hyrum late in the afternoon of June 27, 1844.12",1,

First, she would break her vows that she had made by committing adultery, and second she would be raped, which would mean she would still be innocent.

If the husband found out that his bride was pregnant he had two options. He first could bring her to court, where there would be witnesses and a judge who would try to determine whether she was guilty or not of committing adultery, and second the groom could divorce his bride privately. Now this does not mean that it would be private in the fact that nobody would know about it, everybody would still know about it! Nazareth was a very small town and everybody would know about what was going on. By divorcing Mary privately, Joseph not only saved Mary from humiliation (by not having to be brought before a public court), but more importantly he saved her life because of the fact that accusations were never brought against her, meaning that nobody could accuse her of being guilty of committing adultery (the penalty being death).",2,

""Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit."" (Matthew 1:18 NKJV). According to the Law of Moses, if a young man found that his bride was pregnant before their marriage, he had two options. First, he could publicly divorce her, meaning he would bring formal charges against her before a court. If found guilty, she would be stoned to death. Second, the young groom could divorce her privately, or in other words, he would not bring formal charges against her, but simply end the marriage. In this situation both the life of the mother and child would be preserved. Both options were legal under the law. Matthew tells us that Joseph chose to be merciful and ""and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly."" (Matthew 1:19 NKJV).

However, before Joseph was able to divorce Mary, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream telling him to take Mary as his wife. The angel also directs Joseph that he is to name the infant Jesus. By naming the child, according to Jewish tradition, Joseph would formally adopt Jesus as his own. We often just gloss over these few verses, but the implications are massive for Joseph! Consider this story from the perspective of the townspeople who all would know that Mary got pregnant before marriage. By taking her as his wife, Joseph is saying that either he broke his own vows and got Mary pregnant before the wedding feast, or he does not mind being the father to what the people would consider an illegitimate child. Either option would forever brand Joseph as a father of questionable background. Yet, the text seems to imply that Joseph shrugged off these massive consequences, and the instant he awakes from his sleep, does exactly as the angel commands.",3,

There were three parts of the Jewish marriage: first, there was the betrothal, then there was a waiting period, and then there was the actual wedding feast.

[

During the betrothal, the groom and the bride would actually exchanged wedding vows, very similar to what we would have in a modern day wedding. During this time, they were literally considered man and wife. During the next phase, the waiting period, the groom would prepare a home, and the family would prepare for the enormous wedding feast that would occur. The third phase was the actual wedding feast. On this night, the groom would go to the bride's home, followed by a huge procession of lights and torches and lamps. There he would take his bride back to his home, or to his parent's home, and the feast would begin! The feast would be huge and could last up to seven days long, which would help you understand why they needed a year to prepare. At the end of the night, the bride and the groom would consummate their marriage. However, up to this point they were still were considered husband and wife. So if the wife at any point during the betrothal process was found to be pregnant, according to the law, the husband had to divorce her.",0,

Ancient Jewish marriage included three main parts, the betrothal, the period of preparation, and the actual wedding feast.

A young bride typically between eleven and thirteen years old would be formally betrothed to a groom aged about seventeen to twenty. While comparable to an engagement today, it was a far more significant commitment. The bride and groom were actually legally married at the betrothal as wedding vows would be exchanged. The distinction being that the marriage is not yet consummated nor do the couple live together. A period of waiting and preparation would follow when the groom learned a trade, in Joseph's case stone masonry and carpentry, and built a small home for his future bride.

The two families would also prepare for the wedding feast. Unlike today with the convenience of modern-day stores, everything for the wedding would be made by hand, grown, or traded in the market including harvesting all the food, making white robes for each participant, and other significant preparations. This enormous amount of preparation meant that it was very common to wait a full year before the actual wedding feast. Once ready, the groom would go to the home of his bride with a large procession of his family and friends with torches and oil lamps. He then would take his new bride to his father's home where the marriage feast would occur and the marriage would be consummated. The wedding feast was huge often lasting for seven days—all the more reason for a yearlong preparation!",2,

First, we learn that even though it was an arranged marriage, Joseph really loved Mary. The fact the he decided to divorce her privately shows that he cared more about Mary then about being vindicated for something that had been done wrong to him.

Second, everybody knew the story Joseph and Mary. Everybody knew what had happened, or at least what the townspeople would accuse them of. By taking Mary as his wife, Joseph shows that he was willing to do whatever it took and to deal with whatever would come in the future because he knew what the Lord had commanded and he loved Mary.

Third, it shows how much he cared for Jesus Christ. The fact that he actually names Jesus as the Matthew account records (see Matthew 2:25), shows that he not only was willing to take Mary in, but he was actually taking Jesus in as his own adopted son (in essence he was taking in an illegitimate child). By naming Jesus, Joseph literally is legally adopting him into his own line, which is the reason that Jesus Christ can be called the son of David, just as Joseph was the son of David.

Last, we learn that Joseph immediately acted. In the scriptures, it reads ""Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife"" (Matthew 1:24). In other words, Joseph was quick to act and did exactly as the angel told him *the very next day*. From this, it would seem that there was no wedding feast that actually occurred, dashing all the hopes and dreams that Mary and Joseph may have had. The huge feast, the lights, the torches, the music all would have been cancelled and forgone because of the fact that Jesus would be born to Mary. And yet this does not discourage Joseph to the least degree. He knows what is right and he acts.",3,

Because Joseph's story is only covered in four chapters of the Bible and he most likely died before the ministry of the Savior, we often gloss over him, and sadly miss the powerful witness he left of his adopted son, the Messiah of the world.

We know relatively few details about Joseph from the scriptures, but through insights from the historical background of life in Israel, we can actually weave together a beautiful tapestry on the life of Joseph.

Joseph was of the tribe of Judah, and in particular a direct descendant of King David ([Matthew 1:20). This would mean that he, at least in some regards, had a legal right to the throne. Consequently, any of his descendants, including Jesus through adoption, would also have this same status. Despite his royal lineage, the scriptures tell us that Joseph was only a poor carpenter or craftsman. Joseph is typically portrayed in art as working with wood, but because Israel has a limited number of trees and stone is by far the more abundant resource, Joseph would have actually been a carpenter of mostly stone.

According to Jewish custom, we also know that Joseph was most likely quite young. In fact, he probably was only about seventeen to twenty years old when he was engaged to Mary.

1. Evidence suggests that on some occasions during early stages of the translation, Joseph directly utilized the plates in the dictation process.

2. As a physical object which Joseph Smith had personally seen and knew that he could obtain if he was faithful, the plates no doubt helped motivate him to be worthy of his impending prophetic calling.

3. The plates serve, even today, as an object lesson about prioritizing sacred things over worldly temptations.

4. Characters copied from the plates helped convince Martin Harris of their authenticity.

5. The copied characters also facilitated the fulfillment of a significant Book of Mormon prophecy.

6. The physical presence of the plates helped strengthen the faith of Joseph and his associates that his translation was tied to a genuine ancient artifact created by real ancient prophets.

7. The presence of the plates all but eliminates the possibility that Joseph Smith was merely *mistaken* about his revelatory claims, thereby impelling a choice between truth or fraud, while also leaving no rational grounds for interpreting the Book of Mormon as ""inspired fiction.""

He never produced a ""Book of Kinderhook.""20, 490: ""After the first meeting, no further mention was made of translation, and the Kinderhook plates dropped out of sight. Joseph may not have detected the fraud, but he did not swing into a full-fledged translation as he had with the Egyptian scrolls. The trap did not quite spring shut, which foiled the conspirators' original plan. Instead of exposing the plot immediately, as they had probably intended to do, they said nothing until 1879, when one of them signed an affidavit describing the fabrication."""") Whatever Joseph Smith may have thought of the Kinderhook plates, the Lord could not be fooled. God would not and did not reveal a translation of these bogus artifacts.

The more universal message from the Kinderhook incident is that Joseph's ability to translate, like the case of Mosiah's in the Book of Mormon, was a gift from God, and only worked when God enabled him to do His will. The gift of ""the interpretation of languages,"" like all spiritual gifts, ""come[s] by the Spirit of Christ; and they come unto every man severally, according as [Christ] will"" (Moroni 10:16). Like Joseph and Mosiah, we all have gifts from the Lord, which can only be properly used to build-up the kingdom of God. If we try to use these gifts from the Lord for inappropriate or irrelevant purposes, we can expect underwhelming results, like those from the case of the Kinderhook plates.",1,

He once explained that ""the Title Page of the Book of Mormon is a literal translation, taken from the very last leaf, on the left-hand side of the collection or book of plates.""8 David Whitmer once stated that while looking into the seer stone, Joseph Smith saw a ""parchment, on which would appear the characters of the plates in a line at the top, and immediately below would appear the translation in English.""9 How well Joseph Smith regularly understood the correlation between the English text and the characters on the plates, however, is uncertain.

Another important consideration is that the presence of the plates helped confirm Joseph Smith's revelatory claims.10: xxiv argues that the presence of the plates makes it difficult to ""contend that there were no Nephites but that Joseph Smith was nonetheless an inspired prophet. If the plates really existed, somebody made them. And if no Nephites existed to make them, then either Joseph Smith, or God, or somebody else seems to have been engaged in simple fraud. The testimony of the witnesses exists, I think, to force a dichotomous choice: true or false?"""") Anthony Sweat insightfully noted, ""The Book of Mormon text didn't just pass through Joseph's trance-induced revelatory mind; its palpable relics passed through a clothing frock, hollowed log, cooper's shop, linen napkin, wooden chest, fireplace hearth and barrel of beans.""11 According to Michael MacKay and Gerrit Dirkmaat, the plates were ""in essence the body for the spiritual words that fell from Joseph Smith's lips as he translated,"" and they helped instill ""confidence in the minds of Joseph and his family and friends"" that his words were derived from an actual ancient record.12",0,

The third chapter summarizes the outcast condition of Israel in 1823; it also argues that the natives of America are ""the descendants of Israel"" and propounds that all pre-Columbian Americans had one origin, that their language appears originally to have been Hebrew, that they had an ark of the covenant, that they practiced circumcision, that they acknowledged one and only one God, that their tribal structure was similar to Hebrew organization, that they had cities of refuge, and that they manifest a variety of Hebraic traits of prophetic character and tradition.

I. Woodbridge Riley in 1902 was the first author to suggest a relationship between *View of the Hebrews* and the Book of Mormon (*The Founder of Mormonism*, New York, 1902, pp. 124-26). In 1921, LDS Church authorities were asked to reply to questions posed by a Mr. Couch of Washington, D.C., regarding Native American origins, linguistics, technology, and archaeology. B. H. Roberts, a member of the First Quorum of Seventy, undertook a study of Couch's issues; he received some assistance from a committee of other General Authorities. Roberts's first report, in December 1921, was a 141-page paper entitled ""Book of Mormon Difficulties."" However, he was not satisfied with that work and later delved more deeply into other critical questions about Book of Mormon origins, which led him to a major analysis of *View of the Hebrews*.",3,

 The author wants us to believe that View of the Hebrews was a source of information for Joseph Smith in creating the Book of Mormon. Lots of data argues against this.

**Longer response(s) to criticism:**

* Question: Could Joseph Smith have used Ethan Smith's ''View of the Hebrews'' as a guideline for creating the Book of Mormon?
* Question: Was the ''View of the Hebrews'' theory of Book of Mormon origin advanced during the lifetime of Joseph Smith?
* Question: What did B.H. Roberts say about ''View of the Hebrews'' and the Book of Mormon?
* Question: What are the similarities and differences between ''View of the Hebrews'' and the Book of Mormon?
* Question: Has the book ''View of the Hebrews'' been readily available?
* Question: Is there a link between Ethan Smith, author of ''View of the Hebrews'', and Oliver Cowdery?

In the ""Study"" Roberts looked candidly at the possibility that Joseph Smith could have been acquainted with Ethan Smith's book and could have used it as a source of the structure and some ideas in the Book of Mormon. He cited some twenty-six similarities between the two books. In all his writings, Roberts did not draw any conclusions that Joseph Smith used Ethan Smith's work to write the Book of Mormon, but rather posed questions that believers in the Book of Mormon should be aware of and continue to find answers for. Roberts's faith in the Book of Mormon as divinely revealed scripture was unshaken by his studies.

Roberts's papers were published in 1985. This again stirred an interest in the relationship of *View of the Hebrews* and the Book of Mormon, especially since the editorial ""Introduction"" concluded that ""the record is mixed"" as to whether Roberts kept his faith in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon after making his studies (B. D. Madsen, p. 29). Subsequent research, however, strongly indicates that Roberts remained committed to the full claims of the origin and doctrine of the Book of Mormon to the end of his life (Welch, pp. 59-60), and substantial evidence favors the position that there is little in common between the ideas and statements in *View of the Hebrews* and the Book of Mormon.

I had to read the whole thing in order to respond to your letter. No one should have to read View of the Hebrews, because it's an extraordinarily boring and inaccurate book, and it bears only a superficial, cursory resemblance to the Book of Mormon. Anyone who thinks Joseph Smith plagiarized from it has clearly never bothered to read it.

(That includes you, Jeremy.)

A century after the fact, View of the Hebrews was republished by Brigham Young University, which suggests that the Church is not at all concerned if people read View of the Hebrews and compare it to the Book of Mormon. (They still have the entire V of the H text posted on the BYU website.) Incidentally, Joseph Smith was equally unconcerned, and he even cited View of the Hebrews in 1842 as evidence for the authenticity of the Book of Mormon. It would be a very curious thing, indeed, for a plagiarist to call attention to his source material.

To read a single page of Ethan Smith's View of the Hebrews is to instantly recognize that the Book of Mormon did not plagiarize from it. In fact, for the benefit of those reading this, let's do precisely that. I'm going to pluck a paragraph at random and reproduce it here and let readers make a determination for themselves.",3,

View of the Hebrews is a polemical essay about Ethan Smith's theory that the Indians are Israelites. It is not, like the Book of Mormon, a narrative history. It's a recitation of historical facts and speculation; it has no story at all. In addition, the ""evidences"" that Ethan Smith provides to link the Indians to Israel are completely ignored in the Book of Mormon. You won't find chiasmus or much in the way of King James-style English in V of the H. There are no Nephites, Lamanites, Jaredites, or Liahonas, or cureloms or cumoms, or any Book of Mormon proper names or places. Even Captain Kidd is nowhere to be seen.

Below is a chart comparing the View of the Hebrews to the Book of Mormon:

Okay, let's take a look.

NOTE: Oliver Cowdery, one of the Book of Mormon witnesses, lived in Poultney when View of the Hebrews was published.

NOTE: You are incorrect. The Book of Mormon was first published in Palymyra, Wayne County, New York, not Sharon, Windsor County, Vermont.

Windsor is the county where Joseph Smith was born, 24 years prior to the Book of Mormon's publication. The fact that Windsor County is adjacent to Rutland County is about as relevant as the fact that Keokuk, Iowa is where the Des Moines River meets the Mississippi.
Poor B.H. Roberts. You have so woefully misrepresented his work on this subject that it's almost criminal. We'll get to that later.",3,

With the exception of Jerusalem and Jesus Himself, none of the people, places, or events referenced in V of H's first 47 pages correlate in any way to the Book of Mormon. In content, length, and literary structure, the treatment of both books of two different historical accounts couldn't be more different.

Again, let's remember what View of the Hebrews is. As a treatise postulating an Israeli genealogy for Native Americans, it could not make its case without citing recorded historical events that overlap with events of concern to the Book of Mormon. How many other books have been written about these widely known and researched historical events? Should we assume that all of them have plagiarized each other?

B. Both books reference the Scattering of Israel This should be considered a subsidiary of the first point, as Ethan Smith describes at great length Israel's scattering in the context of the Roman sacking of Palestine. The Book of Mormon, however, contains no description of any actual scattering and only makes reference to it in passing and in a much different doctrinal context. Ethan Smith focuses exclusively on the Lost Ten Tribes, which get a few passing mentions but don't really figure into the Book of Mormon narrative at all.

C. Both books reference the Restoration of the Ten Tribes Well, yes, but with entirely different purposes and focus. In the Book of Mormon, the Ten Tribes are almost an afterthought – Lehi's family descend from Joseph, not the Lost Tribes, which is in direct contrast to Ethan Smith's theory that all Indians come from the Ten Tribes.",3,

It is one of several books reflecting the popular fascination at the time of Joseph Smith with the question of Indian origins. While some have claimed it to be a source for the Book of Mormon, no direct connections between this book and the Book of Mormon have been demonstrated.

Ethan Smith was a pastor in Poultney, Vermont when he wrote and published the book. Oliver Cowdery – also a Poultney, Vermont resident – was a member of Ethan's congregation during this time and before he went to New York to join his distant cousin Joseph Smith. As you know, Oliver Cowdery played an instrumental role in the production of the Book of Mormon.

Which is insignificant. Since the Book of Mormon text bears no resemblance to View of the Hebrews, it doesn't matter at all whether or not Joseph or Oliver had seen it before 1830. Certainly Joseph was at least passingly familiar with the text later in life, as he cites it as evidence for the Book of Mormon's authenticity – again, an odd thing for a supposed plagiarist of that material to do. Nobody in Joseph's lifetime thought the two texts were similar enough to merit any accusation of plagiarism, and nobody who spends any significant time with both texts can plausibly claim that one was derived from the other.

This direct link between Joseph and Oliver and View of the Hebrews demonstrates that Joseph is very likely to have been aware of the theme and content of that book.

The fact that Joseph quoted from the book demonstrates that Joseph is very likely to have been aware of the theme and content of that book, at least after the Book of Mormon was published.

And that's partially because if you read A View of the Hebrews, you start to notice immediately that there aren't any parallels, except for the idea that the ancient Hebrews may have been among the ancestors of the Native Americans. A View of the Hebrews reads like a kind of thesis, where he posits ideas and puts them out there. And another thing that—that really pushes back against A View of the Hebrews is that Joseph Smith quoted it during his lifetime. He quoted it as evidence for the Book of Mormon in his lifetime. So in the Times and Seasons in Nauvoo, June 1st, 1842, he actually quotes Ethan Smith, saying, ""Reverend Ethan Smith of Pultney, Vermont … [correction: Joseph Merrick,] a highly respectable character in the church at Pittsfield,"" said that, and then he quotes A View of the Hebrews, basically.

—because it's been so thoroughly disproved. But here's just, in a nutshell, some of the problems. The Manuscript Found, Solomon Spalding's work, is 50,840 words. That means it is less than a fifth of the actual length of the Book of Mormon. You've still got to come up with four-fifths of the Book of Mormon, even if you're saying he plagiarized from this. The writing style and the composition of the two books are really, really different. For instance, the Book of Mormon follows this kind of King James language. The Spaulding manuscript does not. The Spalding manuscript and the Book of Mormon don't have similarities in their storyline. The Spalding manuscript is about a Roman galleon that gets blown off course and lands in the Americas. The Book of Mormon is totally, totally different from that. And honestly, most people, when they have the chance to look at the Spaulding Manuscript and look at the Book of Mormon back off. For instance, Gerald and Sandra Tanner, who have been, like, the top opponents of the Book of Mormon for a long time and written a lot of critical stuff about Joseph Smith, said, ""We do have the original Spaulding manuscript and the Book of Mormon, which do not appear to have enough in common to insist that the latter came from the former.""",2,

Such theories, however, soon were found to be counter to documentary evidence and inconsistent with historical events. As several knowledgeable witnesses attested, Rigdon first saw the Book of Mormon in November 1830, well after it had already been published, and he first met Joseph Smith in person in December 1830—too late to have collaborated on the composition of the Book of Mormon.16: 111–123. Rigdon's authorship is often connected to the so-called ""Spaulding theory,"" hypothesizing that a manuscript written by Solomon Spaulding was used as the basis for the Book of Mormon, with additions/edits from Rigdon or another author. On this theory, see Matthew Roper, ""The Mythical 'Manuscript Found',"" FARMS Review 17, no. 2 (2005): 7–140; Matthew Roper, ""Myth, Memory, and 'Manuscript Found',"" FARMS Review 21, no. 2 (2009): 179–223.

As Rigdon learned of the accusation that he wrote the Book of Mormon, he immediately sought to set the record straight. On one occasion, in front a large gathering of people, he declared:

> I testify in the presence of this congregation, and before God and all his Holy Angels up yonder, (pointing toward heaven), before whom I expect to give account at the judgment day, that I never saw a sentence of the Book of Mormon, I never penned a sentence of the Book of Mormon, I never knew that there was such a book in existence as the Book of Mormon, until it was presented to me by Parley P. Pratt, in the form that it now is.17

Those who reject Joseph Smith's claim that he translated the book through divine power assume that he or one of his contemporaries wrote the book. Various claims or arguments have been advanced to support or discount these competing positions.

Disputes about the book's authorship arose as soon as its existence became public knowledge. The first general reaction was ridicule. Modern minds do not easily accept the idea that an angel can deliver ancient records to be translated by an untrained young man. Moreover, most Christians in 1830 viewed the canon of scripture as complete with the Bible; hence, the possibility of additional scripture violated a basic assumption of their faith. Opponents of Joseph Smith, such as Alexander Campbell, also argued that the Book of Mormon was heavily plagiarized from the Bible and that it reflected themes and phraseology current in New York in the 1820s. Many critics have speculated that Sidney Rigdon or Solomon Spaulding played a role in writing the book (see Spaulding Manuscript). It has also been suggested that Joseph Smith borrowed ideas from another book (see View of the Hebrews). Though these varieties of objections and theories are still defended in many quarters, they are not supported by modern authorship studies and continue to raise as many questions as they try to answer (e.g., *CWHN* 8:54-206).",3,

In that year, Fawn Brodie published *No Man Knows My History*. This biography of Joseph Smith, hostile to his prophetic claims, dismissed the idea of any connection between Spaulding and Smith or their writings. Rigdon first met Joseph Smith in December 1830 after the Book of Mormon was published.

Nevertheless, some have continued to promote the Spaulding theory (e.g., see Holley). In 1977, graphologists claimed to have detected similarities between the handwriting of Spaulding and of one of the scribes who transcribed some of the Book of Mormon from Joseph Smith's dictation. After considerable media attention and further scrutiny, anti-Mormon spokespersons acknowledged that they had been too hasty. The handwriting evidence did not support a connection between Solomon Spaulding and Joseph Smith.

One of them kept a record of their experiences among eastern and midwestern American Indian tribes. The 175-page manuscript was first published as a 115-page monograph in 1885, some seventy years after the death of its author, Solomon Spaulding (sometimes spelled Spalding). The only known manuscript was lost from 1839 until its discovery in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1884. It was promptly published by both the Latter-day Saints and Reorganized Latter Day Saint churches to refute the theory of some critics that it had served as an original source document for the Book of Mormon, supposedly supplied to Joseph Smith by Sidney Rigdon.

Spaulding was born in Ashford, Connecticut, on February 21, 1761. He served in the American Revolution, later graduated from Dartmouth College, and became a clergyman. He subsequently lost his faith in the Bible, left the ministry, and worked unsuccessfully at a variety of occupations in New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania until his death near Pittsburgh in 1816. About 1812 he wrote *Manuscript Found*, which he attempted to publish to relieve pressing debts.",0,

This he raised with a lever, uncovering a cave in which lay a stone box containing twenty-eight rolls of parchment. The writing was in Latin.

In that 1983 treatise, Holley argues that the Book of Mormon was plagiarized from a manuscript by Solomon Spaulding. The problem, of course, is that he's wrong.

For any not familiar with the Spaulding Theory, I turn again to my father's Leap of Faith book, with words again taken from his digital manuscript:

Sometime prior to 1829, a former Presbyterian Minister named Solomon Spaulding was known to have written a novel called ""The Manuscript Found,"" in which a fictional Indian describes events that took place in America before Columbus.
Joseph's detractors focused on the similarity between this plot line and the story of The Book of Mormon and insisted that Joseph was a simple plagiarist. Somehow, they say, he had come across the Spaulding book and pilfered it for his own purposes.",3,

Those holding to this view see the book as reflecting no inspiration and having no historical value, although they may see some religious value in it as a statement of Joseph Smith's religious feelings. The assumption underlying this view may be either a doctrinaire rejection of divine intervention in human affairs or a specific rejection of Joseph Smith's claims to experience with the divine. Those maintaining this position may accept either the Spaulding theory or, more commonly, various environmentalist explanations for the contents of the book (see View of the Hebrews). One environmentalist explanation that has attracted some interest in the recent past among both believers and nonbelievers is based on the purported ""magic worldview"" that suffused the environment in which Joseph Smith grew up. However, this position has been heavily criticized and has not been widely received.

Another view of the Book of Mormon accepts its inspiration but rejects its historical authenticity, seeing it as in some sense inspired but not the product of antiquity, coming rather from the pen of Joseph Smith.

A third position accepts parts of the Book of Mormon as ancient, but views other parts of the book as inspired expansions on the text. This view has suffered because a concession that any part of the book is authentically ancient (and beyond the powers of Joseph Smith to have established through research) seems an admission that the Book of Mormon is what it claims to be and what has traditionally been claimed for it: that it is ancient.",1,

Number four is that Joseph Smith went into some kind of trance state and wrote in what we call automatic writing, and then interestingly, a lot of opponents of the Book of Mormon have circled back to saying, ""Well, Joseph Smith was a genius. That's the only way to explain the Book of Mormon."" So the arc is that they start out saying, ""Joseph Smith was too dumb to have done this. What's an alternate explanation?"" to where we get to the point to where most modern opponents of the Book of Mormon are saying, ""Joseph Smith must have just been a genius. How else could he have done this?"" So let's walk through each one, OK? Starting with the one that gets the most currency, which is the Spaulding theory. So this is by far the most popular theory that shows up in the 19th century. Apparently there's a reverend named Solomon Spaulding who writes some kind of book about an early American civilization that's linked to the Book of Mormon. And the reason why this one worked so well and gained so much press was because the manuscript was lost. Nobody knew where it was, and so you could basically project anything you wanted to onto the manuscript and say, ""Yeah, Joseph Smith just stole from this."" Now, the theory was dealt a major blow when the manuscript was found. In 1884, it was found in Honolulu, Hawaii, of all places, and actually, that is the name of the manuscript when it was discovered. It's called Manuscript Found.

Moroni's famous promise, for instance, explicitly exhorts and invites readers to ask God the Eternal Father about the truthfulness of the record, and ensures that if they do so in sincerity and faith in the name of Jesus Christ, ""he will manifest the truth of it … by the power of the Holy Ghost"" (Moroni 10:4).

Because the power of the Holy Ghost will unequivocally testify to the historical reality and spiritual message of the Book of Mormon, it therefore stands as a valid witness of God's influence and interaction with His children.13 To believe in the truth of its stories is to believe in the divinity, resurrection, and miraculous power of Jesus Christ. To follow its messages and commandments is to follow the words, inspiration, and ""Spirit of Christ"" (Moroni 7:16) and to ""come unto him, and be perfected in him"" (Moroni 10:32).",0,

* 13) The First Book of Napoleon, The Tyrant of the Earth (1809) has similar language to that found in the Book of Mormon.

Answer: The similarities between the Book of Mormon and the The First Book of Napoleon don't extend beyond the fact that both use language that is similar to the King James Bible. Stylometric studies show (like they do with the Late War) that the Book of Mormon and The First Book of Napoleon are very far apart in their use of King James writing styles. It's extremely unlikely that the Book of Mormon copied or borrowed from the The First Book of Napoleon.

The CES Letter highlights a number of supposed parallel word usages between the Book of Mormon and The First Book of Napoleon that seem to support a borrowing. In one example, the CES Letter pulls selected text from the Book of Mormon and compares it with text taken from The First Book of Napoleon. This is how it appears in the CES Letter:

So Napoleon Bonaparte, he is known for a lot of things, but one of them is his late 18th century adventures and depredations and exploits in Egypt, where he unintentionally inaugurates an age of exploration and inquiry into all things Egyptian antiquities. So in 1798, Napoleon enters into Alexandria, Egypt, and then he starts to, like, bust into tombs and graves, and there's treasures in there. There's all these mummies and artifacts. And after he paved the way for that, plundering in Egypt skyrockets after this point. There's an Italian man somewhere between 1817 and 1821. His name is Antonio Lebolo. He's an Italian explorer, he's an antiquities dealer, and he uncovered a tomb near Thebes, Egypt, which is kind of down in the middle of Egypt and then over to the right a little bit if you're looking on a map. And in Thebes, he found a large cache of mummies and papyri. He procured eleven mummies and some of the papyrus scrolls from that Thebes area and takes them to Italy.

At first glance, that seems pretty damning, right? *Surely* Joseph copied that over, because how could he not?

Yet, we're supposed to believe that this book is the inspiration for the Book of Mormon? Really? Come on.

But the problems don't stop there. Take a look at the Book of Mormon paragraph:

At the beginning of the book of First Nephi, we have a header that gives a description of the events that are to come in the book. Nephi wrote this header, and included one for Second Nephi as well.

The most interesting part of the header for First Nephi is that the nature of the writing changes for the last line. For the most part, the synoptic header is written in the third person, a practice that continues in all other book headers. Then, in the last line, it shifts to first person.

It would be best to consider that line as a chapter header rather than a book header. Nephi will have a chapter header in Second Nephi Chapter 6, so he clearly has that understanding in his literary arsenal.

This new theory posits that ""Joseph [Smith] most likely grew up reading a school book called *The Late War* by Gilbert J. Hunt and it heavily influenced his writing of The Book of Mormon.""23 Published in 1816, The Late War Between the United States and Great Britain gave an account of the War of 1812 that was intended to be an educational textbook for schoolchildren. To support the idea that Joseph Smith drew from this book in fabricating the Book of Mormon, some authors have pointed to ""similarities"" and parallels between the two books, including ""over 100 rare phrases that bind The Book of Mormon to The Late War.""24

While this theory has become popular in some online circles, it suffers from many problems. Most glaring is the fact that, as demonstrated by recent statistical analysis, the ""similarities"" and linguistic parallels between the Book of Mormon and *The Late War* are easily explainable as shared imitation of the language of the King James Bible, and not direct literary dependence.25 Beyond this, others have pointed out that many of the parallels typically listed between the two books are illusory or otherwise rather weak.26",2,

In this way we get a lot of biblical sounding text. The Book of Mormon, on the other hand, doesn't just use biblical language, it engages biblical issues – it asks questions about morality, about agency, about creation. It ponders the meaning of writing and reading. It describes religious experience.""27: 354–355."")

These problems with the Late War Theory indicate that in all likelihood, rather than the Book of Mormon flagrantly plagiarizing Hunt's work, the two books emerged alongside others in a shared early American literary culture.28, 2. Shalev also discussed the position of the Book of Mormon in this broader literary culture and wondered if ""the Book of Mormon's biblical language . . . catered to audiences' need to hear prophecy in the language that was universally accepted as suitable and even necessary for divine pronouncements."" Shalev, American Zion, 84–117, quote at 114. For another view, see Stanford Carmack, ""Is the Book of Mormon a Pseudo-Archaic Text?""

The gospel of Jesus Christ calls upon disciples to ""do good; seek peace"" (Psalm 34:14) and ""live peaceably with all men"" (Romans 12:18). In His Sermon on the Mount, the Savior said, ""Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God"" (Matthew 5:9). He then taught His disciples to reconcile with adversaries (vv. 21–26), turn the other cheek (v. 39), and ultimately, ""love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you"" (v. 44).

In response to the first wave of persecution and mob violence directed against the Saints in 1833, Joseph Smith received a revelation instructing the Saints to ""renounce war and proclaim peace"" (Doctrine and Covenants 98:16) and to endure persecution patiently and seek to resolve conflicts peacefully before taking up arms in self-defense (D&C 98:23–37). On multiple occasions when local Church leaders from Parowan and Cedar City counseled together regarding the emigrant company at the Mountain Meadows, they encouraged actions that would prevent or deescalate the violence and promote peace. It was only by repeatedly ignoring the judicious and sound decisions of these councils that the massacre was brought about.

Speaking on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of this tragic event, President Henry B. Eyring said:

> The gospel of Jesus Christ that we espouse abhors the cold-blooded killing of men, women, and children. Indeed, it advocates peace and forgiveness. What was done here long ago by members of our Church represents a terrible and inexcusable departure from Christian teaching and conduct. We cannot change what happened, but we can remember and honor those who were killed here.28

It is well documented that Brigham Young's command was to let the travelers pass through in peace, but his advice arrived too late to prevent the killing, and a locally orchestrated cover-up portrayed the crime as solely an Indian depredation. Responding to charges that whites were involved, President Young urged the new governor to investigate, but Governor Cumming maintained that if whites were involved they would be pardoned under the general amnesty granted in 1858. Eventually, as more information came to light, some of the principal participants were excommunicated from the Church and one, John D. Lee, was convicted in federal court and executed.

Though preoccupied by the Civil War, the federal government nonetheless demonstrated interest in Utah Territory. In 1862 Fort Douglas was established on the eastern edge of Salt Lake City, under the leadership of a dedicated anti-Mormon, Patrick Edward Connor. Connor and his troops were charged with guarding transportation routes, but they also published the aggressively anti-Mormon *Union Vedette*, encouraged mining, and promoted non-Mormon immigration to the territory. In 1863 Connor's troops attacked a group of Northern Shoshone Indians on the Bear River in the northern Cache Valley, killing some 250 men, women, and children.",3,

These officials would then go back to Washington and spread rumors about the Saints, which stirred up further animosity.8 On July 24, 1857, word reached Utah of an approaching army sent by the US government.9."") The intentions of this military force were initially unclear, but given the Saints' past experience with violent persecution, many assumed the worst. The Saints began to prepare for war. Brigham Young and other leaders throughout Utah gave wartime speeches, rallying the Saints to defend themselves and encouraging them to store up any surplus grain, guns, and ammunition.10

Summer was also a time when many people emigrated, and by some reports an especially high volume of emigrants poured into California in 1857. Many wagon trains heading to California would pass through Utah, hoping to restock and resupply on food, ammunition, and other necessities in Salt Lake City and other towns along the trail. Although these wagon trains were generally good for the Utah economy, squabbles between the emigrants passing through and the settled population, including Native Americans, were not uncommon. The heightened tensions in Utah due to the wartime atmosphere served to magnify these petty conflicts in the minds of some of the Saints.11",3,

Recent years alone have witnessed riots, mass shootings, and war. Such violence is endemic to the human condition. Too often, regular people get swept up in the heat of a moment, and a specific set of conditions leads typically good people to commit unspeakable acts of violence. Regrettably, Latter-day Saints have not been immune to this common human problem.

Violence was an especially prevalent reality on the American frontier in the nineteenth century, where it was often directed toward minority groups, including religious minorities, who were unfairly perceived as the source of various social ills.2 As such, Latter-day Saints were regularly victims of violence in the 1830s and '40s.3, 6–19."") Incidents like the Hawn's Mill Massacre, which was set amid the violent expulsion of Latter-day Saints from Missouri,4."") and the later martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith followed by another violent expulsion—this time from Illinois—had a generational impact upon the Latter-day Saints who endured these injustices and lost loved ones either in the violence or its aftermath.5."")

At times, after repeated acts of violence against them, the Saints responded with violence of their own, which they saw as acts of self-defense. As one trio of historians noted, however, ""The majority could take the law into its own hands with impunity, but when minorities employed the same approach or tried to fight back, it usually backfired.""6 Such acts of aggression tended to confirm the stereotypes about how violent and depraved the ""Mormons"" were and thus escalated the hostilities directed toward them. Still, according to D. Michael Quinn, ""Mormon marauding against non-Mormon Missourians in 1838 was mild by comparison with the brutality of the anti-Mormon militias.""7, 99."")",2,

John D. Lee was recruited to persuade the Paiutes, who only agreed to do it if Lee led them.18 When Haight convened a council meeting in Cedar City to try to obtain approval for the attack, he was opposed by other local leaders, who forced him to agree to send a messenger to Brigham Young asking how to proceed.19 Before a messenger could be sent, however, an ambush was launched on the emigrants by Lee and some Paiutes. The wagon company circled their wagons in a defensive position and settled in for what became a five-day siege.20

A messenger was still sent to Brigham Young, but before he could return events began to spiral out of control. The emigrants became aware that it was not merely an attack by natives, but that Mormons were involved. Fearing the consequences if word got out that the Mormons had attacked a wagon train, Haight and others determined that they could not allow survivors to escape, but Haight felt he needed permission from William Dame to execute his deadly plan.21

Once again, a council was called in Parowan with Dame and other leaders. But these men did not approve an attack on the emigrants, and instead a plan was made to help the company continue on its way to California.22 Haight believed this was unacceptable. He and one of his counselors privately met with Dame and pressed upon him his fear that letting the emigrants survive to tell of the attack ""would unleash aggression on the southern Mormon settlements.""23 Reports on exactly what was said and agreed to in this meeting are conflicting and uncertain, but Haight came away believing that he had Dame's support for his subsequent actions.24",2,

""In our time,"" he said, ""we can read such history as is available, but we really cannot understand nor comprehend that which occurred those tragic and terrible September days in 1857. Rather, we are grateful for the ameliorating influence that has brought us together in a spirit of reconciliation as new generations gather with respect and appreciation one for another. A bridge has been built across a chasm of cankering bitterness. We walk across that bridge and greet one another with a spirit of love, forgiveness, and with hope that there will never be a repetition of anything of the kind.""

Besides a few persons who left the party before the attack, only about eighteen small children were spared. Two years later, seventeen of the children were returned to family members in northwestern Arkansas. Two decades after the tragedy, one of the Mormon settlers who were present at the massacre, John D. Lee, was executed by a firing squad at the Mountain Meadows, symbolically carrying to the grave the responsibility for those who ""were led to do what none singly would have done under normal conditions, and for which none singly can be held responsible"" (Brooks, p. 218).

Yet for more than another century after Lee's death, the community guilt of those who participated in the massacre continued to fester alongside the collective pain of both the children who survived it and the relatives of those who did not. Then in the late 1980s, the descendants of those affected by the tragedy began meeting to bind the wounds and achieve a reconciliation. On September 15, 1990, many of them gathered to dedicate a memorial marker to those who died at the Mountain Meadows.

One speaker at the marker dedication was Judge Roger V. Logan, Jr., of Harrison, Arkansas, a man related to twenty-one of the massacre victims listed on the marker, as well as to five of the children who survived. ""I am happy to say that thanks to the work, cooperation and gifts of many of you,"" he said, ""there is now an appropriate monument standing in the place of the emigrants' demise; a monument containing the names of eighty-two persons who died and seventeen who survived and [that] also contains reference to many others who may have been a part of the caravan."" As he read the victims' names, he asked all related to them to stand in their honor.",2,

The name Jesus, like Joshua, derives from the Hebrew root *yasha'*, meaning ""to deliver, rescue, or save""; and *christos* is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew *mashiyach*, meaning ""anointed"" or ""Messiah"" (see Jesus Christ, Names and Titles of). Thus, the Nephites used the intimate yet freely spoken name of the mortal Jesus as their name for God, while the ineffable YHWH (see Jehovah, Jesus Christ) appears only twice in the book (2 Ne. 22:2; Moro. 10:34).

Some, such as Sherem, whose cultural roots lay in the monotheistic world of Jerusalem, resisted the worship of the Messiah, alleging that this violated the Law of Moses (Ex. 20:3; Jacob 7:7; see Antichrists). Nephi had previously declared that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost were ""one God"" (2 Ne. 31:21), but Nephite challengers continued to attack the proposition that Jesus was God, to deny that his Atonement could be efficacious in advance of its occurrence, and to argue that there could not be many Gods who were still one God (e.g., Mosiah 17:8; Alma 11:28). Abinadi and others gave inspired explanations (Mosiah 14-16; see Jesus Christ, Fatherhood and Sonship of), but until the resurrected Jesus appeared, announced by and praying to the Father, such issues were not firmly put to rest.",3,

The names used for Christ in the Book of Mormon are important conveyors of meaning, content, and power. Names in antiquity typically conveyed meaning. They bespoke the character, individuality, and qualities of the person. Knowing and personally taking upon oneself the name of God was a sacred and vital function in ancient Israel and in the Book of Mormon: In the Old Testament, Jehovah said, ""And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them"" (Numbers 6:27), and in the Book of Mormon King Benjamin proclaims, ""There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh"" (Mosiah 5:8).

> In [2 Nephi 25:19] Nephi specifically refers to the fact that the angel of God revealed the name of the Messiah and that his name would be ""Jesus Christ the Son of God"". And *Jesus Christ* is precisely what the angel in 1 Nephi 12:18 gives as the name of the Lamb of God.11

He remembered and wrote it down, but then chose not to use it again until he was nearly finished with his record, after quoting extensively from Isaiah. Then, after reintroducing the name and reminding readers that an angel had revealed it, Nephi went on to use both *Jesus* and *Christ* together 5 more times, and the name *Jesus* alone appears another 3 times.18; 30:5 (2x). For only Jesus, see 2 Nephi 31:10; 33:4, 6."")

Perhaps Nephi chose to begin using the name during his commentary on Isaiah because, in Hebrew, ""The names 'Jesus' and 'Isaiah' are similar in form and meaning.""19, 490. Yesha'yahu (Isaiah) is composed of yesha, which means ""help, deliverance, salvation,"" and then the theophoric yahu, meaning Yahweh. Yeshua (Jesus) is another form of the name Yehoshua (Joshua) and likewise derives from yasha. See Ludwig Koehler and Walter Baumgartner, The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament, trans.

Both names are based on the root word *yasha*, meaning *salvation*. It thus may not be a coincidence that right after Nephi reminded readers of the angelically revealed name *Jesus Christ*, Nephi taught the most central doctrine of the Gospel: ""there is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be *saved*"" (2 Nephi 25:30).",1,

Like the carefully chosen names of Nephi and Lehi, can it be said and written of us that we are true disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ? Do we honor the name of Jesus Christ that we have willingly taken upon ourselves? Are we both ""a minister and a witness""18 of His loving-kindness and His redeeming power?

Not long ago, I was listening to the Book of Mormon. In the last chapter of 2 Nephi, I *heard* Nephi say something that I had never *read* the same way before. All throughout his record, he teaches and testifies of the ""Redeemer,"" the ""Holy One of Israel,"" the ""Lamb of God,"" and the ""Messiah."" But as he closed his account, I heard him say these words: ""I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in *my Jesus,* for he hath redeemed my soul.""19 When I heard these words, my heart rejoiced and I had to listen over and over again. I recognized and responded to that verse just as I recognize and respond to my own name.

The Lord has said, ""Yea, blessed is this people who are willing to bear my name; for in my name shall they be called; and they are mine.""20

As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, may we ""gladly [take upon us] the name of Christ""21 by honoring His name with love, devotion, and good works. I testify that He is ""the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father.""22 In the name of His holy child, Jesus Christ, amen.",1,

As times and conditions changed, some words used in describing Christ dropped out of the Nephite texts, whereas others became more frequent in usage. Words such as ""Messiah,"" ""Lamb of God,"" and ""Holy One of Israel"" were used often by Lehi, Nephi, and Jacob but rarely by later Book of Mormon writers. The earlier writers tend to connect the Lord more with Israel than do the later authors.

5. The earlier Book of Mormon writers use greater variety in their names for Christ than do the later writers. In the early texts, more forms of expression were used and greater variety exists in their formulations. Of the sixty-seven names researched in this study, Lehi used fifteen, Nephi used thirty-two, and Jacob, nineteen. Nephite religious speech was evidently more varied in the earlier generations when the revelations were new. As Nephite religious practices and culture became more established, standardized forms and conventions of discourse evidently prevailed.

6. Significantly different names for Christ are used by the various writers of the Book of Mormon. Of the sixty-seven names, thirty-seven are used by only one of the ten prophets under examination. That is further evidence of the multiple authorship of the ancient records underlying the Book of Mormon.",0,

1. These testimonies are true to life. They are corroborated by the credentials of authentic personal experience and complex individual diversity. They make sense historically, and they emerge distinctly even from widely scattered primary sources within individual authors.

2. The testimonies become linguistically more definite as time progresses. Lehi at first spoke of Jesus being ""*a*Messiah,"" ""*a*prophet,"" ""*a* Savior"" (1 Nephi 10:4; emphasis added) or ""*this*Redeemer"" (1 Nephi 10:5; emphasis added), but this designation soon crystallized in Nephi's abridgment as ""*the*Messiah"" (1 Nephi 10:7, 9–10; emphasis added). It is also evident that Lehi was not explicit at first about the meaning of the ""redemption"" of this Messiah. Was it to be a spiritual redemption in the next life, or a physical redemption of the land now or later? This question was raised at least twice by Laman and Lemuel (see 1 Nephi 15:31; 22:1) and finally answered by Nephi: it would be both (see 1 Nephi 22:3).

3. The record often indicates when and how important details about Christ were revealed. The name of ""Christ,"" for example, was told to Jacob by an angel; the name of ""Jesus Christ"" was revealed to Nephi; the extended name, ""Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning,"" was first given to the people by King Benjamin to distinguish them above all people led by the Lord. Nephite knowledge of Christ, like all other facets of revealed knowledge, grew ""line upon line"" (2 Nephi 28:30).",2,

Nelson's charge to call the Church by its revealed name, I turned to where the Savior instructed the Nephites about the name of the Church.1 As I read the Savior's words, I was struck by how He also told the people that ""ye must take upon you the name of Christ.""2 This caused me to look at myself and ask, ""Am I taking upon myself the Savior's name as He would have me do so?""3 Today I would like to share some of the impressions I have received in answer to my question.

**First,** to take upon ourselves the name of Christ means we faithfully strive to see as God sees.4 How does God see?

The name Jehovah vocalized thus is not found in ancient texts, but is a modern convention. In ancient times, the Hebrew text had no vowels; thus the consonants in God's name were *yhwh*. Jews avoided pronouncing these consonants when reading aloud, substituting **adonai*, a word meaning ""the Lord."" Following this practice, King James translators usually rendered* yhwh *as ""the Lord."" In medieval Hebrew texts, the vowels from*** *adonai* were added to the consonants *yhwh* to remind Jewish readers to say ""'*adonai*."" English translators adopted this convention, creating the artificial form ""Jehovah."" Latter-day Saints accept Jehovah as a name for the premortal Christ because this is the common English form for *yhwh*.

**EL.** **El *is not a name, but is the common noun for God in Hebrew (plural,*** *elohim* ). Latter-day Saints often use Elohim for the Father, allowing a distinction between members of the Godhead. Nevertheless, in the Old Testament, El and its cognates, such as Elohim and El Shaddai (God Almighty), usually refer to the premortal Jesus, the God ('*el* ) of the Old Testament.

The instruction to take upon oneself the name of Christ is found in several previous Nephite scriptures, including 2 Nephi 31:13; Mosiah 5:8, 10; Mosiah 25:23; Alma 34:38; and Alma 46:18.",2,

Jesus established this church among us but we don't have a name for it so they're praying when all of a sudden the Lord appears – he came and stood (in verse 2) in the midst of them, and he says ""What will ye that I shall give unto you?"" By the way, just as a side note here, isn't it interesting how often God asks questions of people the answer to which God already knows. But there's something beautiful about him getting people to act, use their agency and to ask before he just comes and gives them things that he already knows better than they do what they need. So here it is again, he's asking them this question and their answer is well we want to know the name whereby we shall call thy church because there are disputations among the people concerning the matter. So there have actually been arguments and maybe contentious debates back and forth. So notice what he says in verse 5: ""Have they not read the scriptures which say that ye must take upon you the name of Christ, which is my name? For by this name shall ye be called at the last day.""

So when establishing his church he's making a really big deal about the name being his own, that you've got to take upon you the name of Christ because name in scripture, especially in antiquity, is associated directly with power. This is the name or the power by which we do what we need to do moving forward.",1,

Moreover, God gives the seer insight into the meaning of his or her visions (2 Sam. 24:11; 2 Chr. 9:29; Jer. 1:11–18). All of this fits quite nicely with how Joseph Smith saw himself.*

*To Bible scholars, the Urim and Thummim is one of several items similar to the* ephod *and* lots *used to determine the will of God or seek information from him. (The Liahona in the Book of Mormon follows this pattern.) It seems that early Mormons began to use the terms* seer stone *and* Urim and Thummim *interchangeably, with the latter convention winning the day. But both terms emerge from biblical practices and understandings.*

As you can see, his point was actually that Joseph using a seer stone was perfectly in line with the Biblical patterns of ""seers,"" something that Joseph was specifically called to be.",1,

(Book of Mormon Translation, LDS.org/topics)",14,"***On August 4th, 2015, LDS.org published an article titled, Joseph the Seer. It contains the first ever, official image of one of Joseph Smith's seer stones. It is the very same stone Joseph found while digging a well on the property of Willard Chase in 1822.***

There are actually multiple stories of how Joseph discovered his stones, and some of them conflict. Mark Ashurst-McGee traces much of the history and clarifies many of the conflicted stories in his Master's thesis, which is archived at Book of Mormon Central. The *Ensign* article in question does not specify exactly how Joseph came to be in possession of this particular stone.

According to Ashurst-McGee, he seems to have discovered the brown stone first by looking into his neighbor Sally Chase's seer stone, and then discovered the *white* stone second, in the Chase property well. He also eventually found two others in and around Nauvoo.

The white stone is the one that Martin claimed Joseph used to find lost objects, including a pin Martin had dropped into a pile of straw and wood shavings. It also appears to be this stone that Martin switched, leaving Joseph temporarily unable to translate. However, later translation witnesses described Joseph using his brown stone. So, he potentially used at least four stones to translate the plates: the white one, the brown one, and the two Nephite interpreters.

Essentially, the brown seer stone pictured in the *Ensign* article is *not* ""the very same stone Joseph found while digging in a well on the property of Willard Chase in 1822."" However, it *is* one of two of Joseph's personal seer stones potentially used during the translation process.",0,

And you totally need to explain a little bit because you just said that the church has a bunch of seer stones. What? What? So are there different people that have, like, claimed seer stones, and so the church collects them or what?

Casey Paul Griffiths:

Yeah, yeah. So there's this mysterious thing called the First Presidency Vault. And I have a friend whose grandfather was the executive secretary of the First Presidency. He gave me a list. This list is well-known, it's not hard to find, of things that are in the First Presidency's vault. And among them were several seer stones, and I'm guessing most of these seer stones don't have a clear provenance. The most likely explanation is that some family brought them to the first presidency and said ""Hey, this is a seer stone. It's legit,"" and the First Presidency kind of said, ""Okay. Well, we'll set it aside,"" because they've only given attention to the brown seer stone, and that's because with any object you have to test its provenance. If someone comes up to you and says, ""Hey, I've got George Washington's hat."" I wouldn't pay a lot of money for that without saying, ""Can you prove to me that it's his hat?"" With this seer stone, the provenance is fairly brief. It's just Joseph to Oliver to Elizabeth to Phineas to Brigham, which is incredibly brief. And it's been in church possession more or less since the 1850s. The other ones don't have any kind of clear sense of provenance. And so they're there, and that's interesting, but I wouldn't associate any historical events with these other seer stones, if that makes sense.

Why is the Church in commercial business of any kind?

Essentially, the business assets which the Church has today are an outgrowth of enterprises which were begun in the pioneer era of our history when we were isolated in the valleys of the mountains of western America. For instance, a newspaper was then needed to keep the people advised of what was going on at home and abroad. The result was the *Deseret News,* which has been published now for 135 years. In the 1920s, government officials encouraged newspapers to set up radio stations. That was in the infancy of the broadcasting industry. One such radio station was established by the *Deseret News* here in Salt Lake City. From that has grown, by the natural process of development, holdings of a number of broadcasting properties.

As all of you will recognize, the ability and the facilities to communicate are among our great and constant needs. The ownership of these properties, both newspaper and broadcasting facilities, while they are operated as commercial entities, both directly and indirectly helps us in our responsibility to communicate our message and our point of view.",3,Nyma

Some properties are also held for reasons other than investment. In addition to protecting the surroundings of sacred properties, such investments may be maintained to support the ecclesiastical efforts of the Church.

The Church still holds a few properties that were originally established to support commerce in LDS communities (see Economic History of the Church). However, as a result of an evaluation of these holdings and their contributions to its mission, the Church has divested many such holdings.

> *The corporation did not become the dominant form of private business organization in America until after the Civil War, and in the early republic corporations were thought of as public institutions whose primary role was to serve the common good. … Incorporation also required a special act of the legislature. Thus, for a church to be incorporated marked it out as the recipient of special favor from the state in view of the church's presumed promotion of the public good.*

>

So, prior to the Civil War, incorporation for churches was a sign that the churches were recognized as forces for the good of society. Each state had different rules: some incorporated virtually all churches, others tried to disestablish all churches and treat them equally in that way, and still others had a mix-and-match approach where some churches were incorporated and some weren't.",2,

These companies pay taxes to federal, state, and local governments. (The Church is the fourth largest payer of real estate taxes in Salt Lake County.) Church businesses have boards of directors that set policies for the individual companies. In most cases, Church leadership is represented on the boards of directors, but many boards include persons of other faiths.

Operating management is in the hands of professional managers, who need not be Church members. The Church requires them to operate the businesses in harmony with its principles and values of honesty, integrity, sensitivity, and service.

The Church expects its businesses to return something back to the communities from which they derive their revenues, and it encourages managers to participate actively in community activities and in business and professional associations.

The Church acquired historical sites, supported hospitals, established recreation centers in local meetinghouses, and erected new offices in Salt Lake City, including a Bishop's Building (1910) for the Presiding Bishopric and auxiliary organizations, and the Administration Building (1917), in which the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve still have their offices. Zions Securities Corporation was created to manage taxable Church properties, and the Corporation of the President was established to oversee ecclesiastical properties.

Church leaders also attended to programs for youth. Early correlation efforts saw the autonomy of Church auxiliaries decline as the Church assumed greater control over auxiliary magazines; the YMMIA's improvement era became a magazine for priesthood and Church readership. In 1911 the Church adopted the Boy Scout program as part of the YMMIA (see Scouting). In response to the secularization of Utah schools during the late nineteenth century, the Church had created stake academies and conducted religion classes after school for elementary-school children. By 1910 a General Board of Education supervised thirty-four stake academies; Brigham Young College in Logan, Utah; Latter-day Saint University in Salt Lake City; and Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. By the 1920s the Church had closed most of its academies or transferred them to the state. Starting in 1912 released-time seminaries provided religious instruction for high school students. In 1926 the first institute of religion for college students opened adjacent to the University of Idaho (see Church Educational System (CES) ""Church Educational System (CES)"")).",1,

Elements of history, theology, and practice combine to form a positive LDS attitude toward honest business endeavors.

Many LDS attitudes toward business are rooted in the Church's frontier heritage. As the Church developed settlements in Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, and the Great Basin, it became necessary and desirable to be involved in business activities. Cooperative business efforts were necessary for success, independence, and survival.

In addition to its spiritual and cultural roles, the Church sponsored economic initiatives that could not be mounted by individual entrepreneurs. For example, when it was determined that sugar would be expensive and difficult to obtain in the Great Basin, the Church in the 1850s sponsored a business venture to cultivate and process sugar beets. Converts brought capital and equipment from Europe, and factories were constructed. After extended difficulties, a thriving sugar beet industry resulted in the 1890s. Similarly, to provide banking services, a Church-sponsored bank was incorporated. A general store-Zion's Cooperative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI)-was begun, as were a newspaper, the Deseret news, and several hospitals; later, radio and television stations were acquired by the Church (see Broadcasting). As the capital needed for these businesses became available from private sources, the Church divested itself of nearly all business activities unrelated to its ecclesiastical mission.",3,

Successive Presidents of the Church have refined the organization to meet changing needs and demands of an expanding international organization but have not altered the fundamental structure of the Church as it was first organized. The Church is presided over by a president, who generally has two counselors; together with him, they constitute the First Presidency of the Church.

A second governing body, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, consists of twelve men called to be ""special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world"" (D&C 107:23). The Quorum of the Twelve collectively holds in latent form the same priesthood authority as the President of the Church, and in the event of his death is the body that governs the Church and installs a new president. Members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are regarded and sustained by vote of Latter-day Saints as prophets, seers, and revelators, receiving direct revelation from Jesus Christ. These brethren are assisted by members of the quorums of the Seventy and the Presiding Bishopric.

The quorums of the Seventy, each consisting of up to seventy men, have special responsibility for missionary work and also supervise Church activities in geographic areas under the direction of the Twelve. The Presiding Bishopric is responsible for the temporal affairs of the Church, including finances, records, buildings, and administration of the Church Welfare Services program. All these men are designated by Latter-day Saints as General Authorities because their authority extends over the entire Church.

In addition, ward officers are in continuing contact with a hierarchy of priesthood leaders linking them directly to the central authorities in Salt Lake City. Wards are organized into stakes, stakes into regions, and regions into areas, which constitute the major international divisions of the Church organization. The present article will describe the organization beginning with the most general level and ending with the local wards.

A body of priesthood leaders called the General Authorities heads the organization of the Church. They are full-time ecclesiastical leaders drawn from the laity, and they receive modest living allowances from returns on investments made by the Church, not from the tithes and offerings paid by members of the Church. The General Authorities consist of the First Presidency of the Church, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles or Council of the Twelve, the quorums of the seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric.

These General Authorities preside over the entire ecclesiastical organization of the Church, from the central headquarters in Salt Lake City, and its area offices in major cities in different parts of the world. They also manage the departments of the central office, which are composed largely of full-time employees who serve the administrative needs of the Church from offices in Salt Lake City and other locations as needed.

All of this may also account in part for the meticulous attention given to record keeping in the Church and by the prophets (see History of the Church; Historians, Church). All members of the Church are encouraged to write personal journals and family histories, and to make them a part of their extended families' sacred possessions.

In recent years the recognition of the Church by historians and sociologists as a distinctive new religion has generated broader interest in the writing and understanding of its history. But the writing of general history, especially religious history, has always had its difficulties. Surviving documents are limited and often inconsistent. Spiritual experiences are often kept private, and primarily lend themselves only to spiritual verification. Memories and lore are selective and fallible. Purposes, needs, audiences, historical fashions, and professional methods change from one decade to the next.

Traditional LDS historians, following their Jewish and early Christian predecessors, have tended to focus heavily on the hand of God in writing about Church and world history. Their histories are generally descriptive and declarative, sympathetic to the historical figures, and written mainly to inspire and build faith. According to William Mulder, ""No where in Mormon record-keeping can [one] escape the teleological, the didactic, the eschatological"" (p. 17).",3,

The Book of Mormon, published in 1830, is a product of ancient records kept by command of God (1 Ne. 9:3, 5; Jacob 1:2; 3 Ne. 23:4, 11-13). Record keeping is also commanded by modern revelation (D&C 21:1;47:3;69:3;72:5-6). Latter-day Saints write history not only to obey divine injunctions but also to combat false reports and to convert and edify future generations (*HC* 1:1; 2:199; 6:409).

Although most of the early commandments pertained to the keeping of ""official"" Church records, Latter-day Saints also apply them to individuals. Joseph Smith and other prominent leaders set the example by keeping journals. Clerks and scribes recorded revelations, minutes of meetings, speeches, correspondence, blessings, and ordinances.

**EARLY CHURCH HISTORIANS, 1830-1842.** Record keeping and history writing were institutionalized with the appointment of Oliver Cowdery as the first Church Recorder when the Church was organized on April 6, 1830 (D&C 21:1). That the Prophet's closest associate and most capable scribe, who also served as second elder in the Church, should be called as Church Recorder is an indication of the importance attached to the position. According to his successor, Cowdery wrote the History of the Church up to mid-1831, when he was released; that early history has never been located. During his second term in office (1835-1837), Cowdery completed a series of eight historical letters that he had started publishing in the messenger and advocate in October 1834.

John Whitmer, one of the eight Book of Mormon Witnesses, served officially as Church recorder between 1831 and 1834 and, after his release, wrote unofficially until his excommunication in 1838. His history for 1831-1838 was published in 1908.",3,

The motivation for compiling this early history was fourfold: (1) to obey a commandment of the Lord (D&C 21:1); (2) to preserve a record of the Church for later generations (see Record Keeping); (3) to combat and correct anti-Mormon publications; and (4) to provide a written record as a protection against false accusations and lawsuits (see Smith, Joseph: Legal Trials of Joseph Smith).

Although the responsibility for keeping a History of the Church was delegated to the Church recorder and historian, Joseph Smith was the prime motivator. He selected able men, gave them regular encouragement and instruction, and provided space for them in his home or store.

There are journals, letters, revelations, court transcripts, sermons, meeting minutes, etc. You can now access them for free with just a few words typed into a search engine.

Again, Elder Snow did not say that the true history of the Church was ""kept closed all these years."" He said that the historical collections at the Church History Library were available only on a restricted basis. Those are very different things. As this series will hopefully show, this information was widely available even before the internet was around. You just had to know where to look.

As for the Church's ""troublesome past,"" I said in the CES Letter series that these supposed historical controversies become a lot less controversial when you put the quotes and events back into their proper context. That is what the Church is trying to do by posting all of their documents online, and writing things like *Saints* and the Gospel Topics Essays. That's what this series will try to do as well.

However, history is messy and people aren't perfect. Mistakes were made along the way, and that's to be expected. There are gaps in the historical record, and that's to be expected, too.

It was ignorance of a true knowledge of God and man's relationship to him that spawned the many churches.

During the 1820s a knowledge of the fundamental principles and ordinances of the gospel was revealed anew from heaven to the boy prophet, Joseph Smith. Many of these principles and ordinances he learned from the Book of Mormon, which came to him in the following manner.

In September 1827, Moroni, an ancient American historian and prophet, at that time resurrected, delivered to Joseph a record inscribed on thin sheets of gold, which, by the gift and power of God, Joseph translated. This record contained an explanation of the principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as it was taught and implemented among the ancient people of America.

In 1829 Joseph published his translation under the title The Book of Mormon. This book contains a record of the personal ministry of Jesus Christ among the inhabitants of America immediately following his post-resurrection ministry in the land of Jerusalem. To them he taught his gospel, even as he had taught it in Palestine. Among them he organized his church. Upon their leaders he conferred the holy priesthood. He instructed them concerning, and showed them how to administer, the saving ordinances of his gospel.

By the time he published the Book of Mormon Joseph had also received the third indispensable element of the gospel, namely, the holy priesthood, which empowered him to act for and in the name of God.",3,

**ELABORATION AND CONTINUITY.** The Church faced the 1880s with a well-developed and well-functioning organization; in addition, it was beginning to create auxiliary organizations for children and youth. Over decades these would mature and be fine-tuned to function more effectively in an increasingly complex world.

Church pioneering institutions also remained. During the 1880s and 1890s, the Church continued to direct colonization and economic development (see Economic History of the Church). Building on the cooperative movement of the 1860s and the united orders of the 1870s, by the 1880s the First Presidency was coordinating development and regulated economic competition through a central Board of Trade and similar stake boards. During this period as well, revelations to President John Taylor initiated a revitalization of quorums of Seventy and moved these quorums toward becoming stake rather than general Church entities.

Thus, some Nauvoo Masons thought of the Endowment as a restoration of a ritual only imperfectly preserved in Freemasonry and viewed Joseph Smith as a master of the underlying principles and allegorical symbolism (Heber C. Kimball to Parley P. Pratt, June 17, 1842, Church Archives). The philosophy and major tenets of Freemasonry are not fundamentally incompatible with the teaching, theology, and doctrines of the Latter-day Saints. Both emphasize morality, sacrifice, consecration, and service, and both condemn selfishness, sin, and greed. Furthermore, the aim of Masonic ritual is to instruct-to make truth available so that man can follow it.

Resemblances between the two rituals are limited to a small proportion of actions and words; indeed, some find that the LDS Endowment has more similarities with the Pyramid texts and the Coptic documents than with Freemasonry. Even where the two rituals share symbolism, the fabric of meanings is different. In addition to creation and life themes, one similarity is that both call for the participants to make covenants. Yet, the Endowment alone ties covenants to eternal blessings and to Jesus Christ. The Masonic ceremony does not emphasize priesthood or the need to be commissioned by God to represent him. The active participation of God in the world and in men's lives is a distinctly LDS temple motif. While Masons believe in an undefined, impersonal God, everything in the LDS Endowment emanates from, or is directed to, God who is a personage and man's eternal Father. The Endowment looks to the eternities and to eternal lives, but Freemasonry is earthbound, pervaded by human legend and hope for something better.",3,

Snoek et al., History of Freemasonry, p. 14) and (notwithstanding the fantastic claims of best-sellers) the first suggestion of a link between chivalry and Freemasonry does not occur until 1723 (P. Mollier, Freemasonry and Templarism, pp. 83–84).*
>

> *That said, few scholars would disagree that many of Freemasonry's ideas and ritual components drew on ideas from ancient sources, especially early Christianity (see, e.g., M. B. Brown,**Exploring**, pp. 45–55). Indeed in 1766, in one of the earliest exposés of Masonry, Bérage,**Les Plus Secrets Mystères**, p. ix went so far as to say: ""the mysteries of Masonry … are nothing more than those of the Christian religion.""*

> *Though Old Testament themes are pervasive in Masonic ritual, it seems clear that they come by way of Christian tradition. As R. J. Van Pelt,**Freemasonry and Judaism**, pp. 189-190 observes: ""There is no evidence that the most important Old Testament stories, themes and symbols that found their way into Freemasonry were directly derived from the Tanakh [= the Hebrew Bible]. … In fact, they are clearly derived from the King James translation of the Bible. Therefore these are all examples of a Christian legacy.""*

In the temple Endowment all covenants are between the individual and God. In Freemasonry, testing, grading, penalizing, or sentencing accords with the rules of the fraternity or membership votes. In the Endowment, God alone is the judge. Within Freemasonry, rank and promotions are of great importance, while in the LDS temple rites there are no distinctions: all participants stand equal before God. The clash between good and evil, including satan's role, is essential to, and vividly depicted in, the Endowment, but is largely absent from Masonic rites. Temple ceremonies emphasize salvation for the dead through vicarious ordinance work, such as baptism for the dead; nothing in Masonic ritual allows for proxies acting on behalf of the dead. Women participate in all aspects of LDS temple rites; though Freemasonry has women's auxiliaries, Masonic ritual excludes them. The Endowment's inclusion of females underscores perhaps the most fundamental difference between the two rites: LDS temple rites unite husbands and wives, and their children, in eternal families (see Eternal Lives, Eternal Increase; Marriage). Latter-day Saint sealings would be completely out of place in the context of Masonic ceremonies.

Thus, Latter-day Saints see their temple ordinances as fundamentally different from Masonic and other rituals and think of similarities as remnants from an ancient original.

Several scholars of differing degrees of belief in Joseph Smith's teachings have analyzed the evidence and arrived at this conclusion. Michael Homer argued that ""the rituals of Freemasonry provided a starting point for the Mormon prophet's revelation of 'true Masonry.'"" David Buerger argued that the pattern of resemblances was too great and the content of the endowment too unique to explain simply. ""Thus,"" he concluded, ""the temple ceremony cannot be explained as wholesale borrowing from Masonry; neither can it be explained as completely unrelated to Freemasonry."" Allen Roberts concluded that ""Joseph's Masonry was not a conventional one. He attempted to restore it in much the same way the gospel was restored. That is, he saw Masonry like Christianity, as possessing some important truths which could be beneficially extracted from what was otherwise an apostate institution.""*

So, here's what it all really boils down to: yes, there are some elements of Masonic ceremony in the endowment. But those elements link back at least to early Christianity, and some are far older than that. Additionally, those elements are small things, like signs, tokens, symbols, minor phrasing, and the fact that there's a ritual drama to teach us important lessons. They do not include the lessons themselves or the ordinances and covenants.",3,

Modified over centuries, these rituals existed in some form among ancient Egyptians, Coptic Christians, Israelites, and Masons, and in the Catholic and Protestant liturgies. Common elements include the wearing of special clothing, ritualistic speech, the dramatization of archetypal themes, instruction, and the use of symbolic gestures. One theme common to many-found in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the Egyptian pyramid texts, and Coptic prayer circles, for example-is man's journey through life and his quest, following death, to successfully pass the sentinels guarding the entrance to eternal bliss with the gods. Though these ceremonies vary greatly, significant common points raise the possibility of a common remote source.

The Egyptian pyramid texts, for example, feature six main themes: (1) emphasis on a primordial written document behind the rites; (2) purification (including anointing, lustration, and clothing); (3) the Creation (resurrection and awakening texts); (4) the garden (including tree and ritual meal motifs); (5) travel (protection, a ferryman, and Osirian texts); and (6) ascension (including victory, coronation, admission to heavenly company, and Horus texts). Like such ancient ceremonies, the LDS temple Endowment presents aspects of these themes in figurative terms. It, too, presents, not a picture of immediate reality, but a model setting forth the pattern of human life on earth and the divine plan of which it is part.

Masonic ceremonies are also allegorical, depicting life's states-youth, manhood, and old age-each with its associated burdens and challenges, followed by death and hoped-for immortality. There is no universal agreement concerning when Freemasonry began. Some historians trace the order's origin to Solomon, Enoch, or even Adam. Others argue that while some Masonic symbolism may be ancient, as an institution it began in the Middle Ages or later.",3,

There were statements given by Joseph prior to 1842 regarding the endowment as well as mentions of ancient symbols and tokens that have associations with Freemasonry. As Brian Hales states, ""Freemasonry in Nauvoo offers too little, too late to serve as the starting point and principal source of inspiration for the major doctrines and teachings relating to priesthood and temple ordinances. … Given Joseph Smith's reluctance to share the details of the most sacred events and doctrines publicly, it is certainly possible he received specific knowledge about some temple matters even earlier than can be now documented. These matters include: 1) the narrative backbone, clothing, and covenants of the modern temple endowment, especially as described in the book of Moses (1830-1831); 2) the sequence of blessings of the oath and covenant of the priesthood described in D&C 84 (1832); and 3) priesthood keys and symbols expressed in keywords, names, signs, and tokens (from 1829).**""**

Matthew Brown elaborates on this in his book. There's an entire chapter devoted to the evidences and symbols of the endowment that preceded Joseph's becoming a Mason, which reads, in part:

> *The theory that Joseph Smith took ritual elements from the Freemasons in order to create the LDS temple ceremony is principally founded upon the concept of time. Supporters of this theory argue that since the Prophet joined the Masonic fraternity shortly before he introduced the Nauvoo endowment among the Saints—and because there are similarities between the two sets of ceremonies—the leader of the Mormons must have been guilty of unacknowledged borrowing from the Masons.*

Is it really that surprising that He might inspire Joseph to do the same thing when trying to teach the endowment to the Saints? Because it seems like Joseph was using those Masonic elements to teach eternal principles to the Saints who were already familiar with those ceremonies.

Jeffrey Bradshaw explains:

For instance, Joseph Fielding, an endowed member of the Church who joined Freemasonry in Nauvoo, said: ""Many have joined the Masonic institution.

Define ""links."" You would be correct to say that it's impossible to demonstrate that the rituals of Masonry have been handed down from the time of Solomon in an unbroken chain. You would be incorrect to say that Masons have not appropriated their understanding of ancient practices into their ceremony. The ""link,"" then, would not be a passed-down line of authority but one of similar ideas, many of which the Masons undoubtedly got wrong but a few, apparently, they got right.

Although more a Church folklore, with origins from comments made by early Mormon Masons such as Heber C. Kimball, than being Church doctrine, it's a myth that the endowment ceremony has its origins from Solomon's temple or that Freemasonry passed down parts of the endowment over the centuries from Solomon's temple.

The Church makes no attempt to claim that either Freemasonry or the endowment claim their authority from being ""passed down"" in an unbroken chain from Solomon's temple.",3,

This law of finance for God's Church has been reiterated in latter-day scripture. In 1838 the Lord emphasized this important law in a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith and defined tithing as ""one-tenth of all their interest [income] annually"" (D&C 119:4).",3,Joseph

Examples of the use of tithing funds are the construction of temples, the financing of the worldwide missionary effort, the building and maintenance of meetinghouses, and other worthy purposes.

***Why does the Lord require His people to pay tithing?*** The Lord is our Father, and as our Father, He loves us. Because He loves us, He wants to bless us both temporally and spiritually. Listen to some of His statements as written in the scriptures: ""Hearken and hear, O ye my people, saith the Lord and your God, ye whom I delight to bless with the greatest of all blessings.""4 And another: ""For thus saith the Lord—I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.""5",3,

Is the Church an institution of great wealth, as some claim?

The Church does have substantial assets, for which we are grateful. These assets are primarily in buildings in more than eighty nations. They are in ward and stake meeting facilities. They are in schools and seminaries, colleges and institutes. They are in welfare projects. They are in mission homes and missionary training centers. They are in temples, of which we have substantially more than we have ever had in the past, and they are in genealogical facilities. But it should be recognized that all of these are money-consuming assets and not money-producing assets. They are expensive to build and maintain. They do not produce financial wealth, but they do help to produce and strengthen Latter-day Saints. They are only a means to an end. They are physical facilities to accommodate the programs of the Church in our great responsibility to teach the gospel to the world, to build faith and activity among the living membership, and to carry forward the compelling mandate of the Lord concerning the redemption of the dead.

We have a few income-producing business properties, but the return from these would keep the Church going only for a very short time. Tithing is the Lord's law of finance. There is no other financial law like it. It is a principle given with a promise spoken by the Lord Himself for the blessing of His children.

When all is said and done, the only real wealth of the Church is the faith of its people.",3,

The collection and disbursement of all funds are carefully managed according to standard procedures worldwide and under the direct supervision of the First Presidency. The Church also maintains limited business investments and financial reserves as part of its larger strategy for supporting expanding ecclesiastical programs. The handling of all funds is regularly audited in accordance with sound financial practices.,1,

He is ""no respecter of persons.""14 His law of revenue is truly an equitable one.

Significant in our day is the way in which tithing is distributed. As we see examples of greed and avarice among some irresponsible corporate executives, we can be grateful that the Lord has provided a way for tithing to be administered under His direction.

According to revelation, bishops are ordained to ""keep the Lord's storehouse; to receive the funds of the church.""15 Both bishops and clerks are expected to be full-tithe payers who have learned to live prudently within their means. Within hours of receiving tithing funds from members of their wards and branches, these local leaders transmit the funds directly to the headquarters of the Church.

Then, as revealed by the Lord, the use of tithing is determined by a council comprised of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the Presiding Bishopric. The Lord specifically states that the council's work be directed ""by mine own voice unto them.""16 This council is called the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes.

It is remarkable to witness this council heed the Lord's voice. Each member is aware of and participates in all the council's decisions. No decision is made until the council is unanimous. All tithing funds are spent for the purposes of the Church, including welfare—care for the poor and needy—temples, buildings and upkeep of meetinghouses, education, curriculum—in short, the work of the Lord.",2,

The common mode of tithing payment is by cash. However, when income has been received in some other form, the member may pay accordingly, as was done anciently (Lev. 27:30, 32).

Without exception, the tithing funds of this Church have been used for His purposes.

The Lord desires that all His children have the blessings of tithing. Too often we as parents do not teach and encourage our children to live this law because their contribution only amounts to a few cents. But without a testimony of tithing, they are vulnerable. In their teenage years, they become attracted to clothes, entertainment, and expensive possessions and risk losing the special protection that tithing provides.

As the years go on, is it possible that a young man can be ordained an elder, serve a mission, and effectively teach a law to others that he has not lived himself? When he returns home and faces the pressures of schooling, starting a family, and a career, will the law of tithing become easier to live? Likewise, will a young woman be worthy to serve the Lord and make celestial marriage covenants without having gained a testimony of tithing for herself? Will she be prepared to teach her children a law she has not learned by her own experience? O what faithfulness is required of fathers and mothers who would unitedly call down the protective blessings of tithing upon their family and the blessings that are rightfully theirs!

I promise you that as you trust in the Lord, the blessings of heaven will follow.

And [they] shall pay one-tenth of all their interest annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever.""11

The Lord clearly directed how tithing should be disbursed, saying, ""Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse,""12 meaning bring the tithes into His restored kingdom, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.13 He directed that the use of these sacred tithes would be prayerfully considered by a council of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the Presiding Bishopric, ""and by mine own voice unto them, saith the Lord.""14",1,

A young man not unfamiliar with praying, and responding to his youthful faith, entered a grove and, looking around and finding himself alone, kneeled, and offered up the desires of his heart to God. The grove became exceedingly light, brighter than he had ever known. Before him stood two glorious personages—defying all description. One pointed to the other and said, *""This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!""* The Son spoke to the kneeling boy. Joseph was told that all the churches were wrong—they had corrupted the doctrine, had changed the ordinances, and had lost the authority of the priesthood—and that he, unlearned but humble, was to be the instrument through whom the Almighty would reestablish his work. (See JS—H 1:15–20).

The prevalent religious teachings of the world had reduced God, in the minds of people, to a fragile spirit, spread throughout the universe, nowhere yet everywhere present—nebulous theories and uncertain doctrine as to the personality of God and the Godhead. Truth had become perverted. When the boy prophet came out of the grove, he had no doubts—he knew. He had looked upon the Father and the Son. They had visited him and instructed him. In the Prophet's own words: ""I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it"" (JS—H 1:25).

Joseph now knew God is in the form of a man. He has a voice, he speaks, he is kind, he answers prayers. His Son is like the Father—but a separate and distinct person. Joseph learned the Son is obedient to the Father and mediator between God and man.

The Lord needed a man of steel, one fearless to withstand ridicule and social and political pressures, one like unto Moses, yet greater.

In due course the boy prophet had other angelic visitations.",2,Joseph

A young boy reads the Bible, and his eyes pause on a singular passage of scripture. This is a moment that will change the world.

He is anxious to know which church can lead him to truth and salvation. He has tried almost everything else, and now he turns to the Bible and reads these words: ""If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.""1

He reflects on them over and over again. The first glimmer of light penetrates the darkness. Is this the answer, the way out of confusion and darkness? Can it be this simple? Ask God and He will answer? At length he decides he must either ask God or ever remain in darkness and confusion.

And yet as anxious as he is, he doesn't run to a quiet corner and rattle off a hurried prayer. He is only 14, but in his haste to know, he is not hasty. This is not to be just any prayer. He decides where to go and when to make the attempt. He prepares to talk to God.

And then the day comes. It is ""the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of .""2 He walks alone into the stillness of the nearby woods, beneath the trees that tower above him. He reaches the place where he previously designed to go. He kneels and offers up the desires of his heart.

Describing what happens next, he says:

""I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.

""… When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—[Joseph,] *This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!*""3

Only 24 years later, Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum will die because of what began here.",3,

There is no dispute about what Joseph Smith accomplished, only how he did what he did and why. And there are not many options. He was either pretender or prophet. Either he did what he did alone, or he had the help of heaven. Look at the evidence, but look at all of the evidence, the entire mosaic of his life, not any single piece. Most importantly, do as young Joseph and ""ask … God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given [you].""17 This is not only how you may learn the truth about the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith; it is also the pattern to know the truth of all things.18

Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, as is Thomas S. Monson today. Through Joseph Smith, ""the keys of the kingdom of God are [again] committed unto man on the earth, and … the gospel [will] roll forth … as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands … , until it has filled the whole earth.""19

God is our Eternal Father, and Jesus is the Christ. We worship Them. Nothing compares with Their creations, the plan of salvation, and the atoning sacrifice of the Lamb of God. In this dispensation, we fulfill the plan of the Father and partake of the fruits of the Atonement only by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I bear testimony of Them—God the Eternal Father and Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. And I do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",2,

The good spoken of Joseph Smith came slowly; the evil speaking began immediately. Joseph wrote, ""How very strange it was that an obscure boy … should be thought … of sufficient importance to attract … the most bitter persecution.""3

While love for Joseph grew, so also did hostility. At the age of 38, he was murdered by a mob of 150 men with painted faces.4 While the Prophet's life abruptly ended, the good and evil spoken of Joseph was just beginning.",2,

There's no reason to assume that only Joseph Smith is asking these questions or longing to know his relationship with and standing to God, and there's no reason to assume that God wouldn't answer others. Now, I don't know. I can't validate or verify whether these are actual experiences or not, but I don't doubt that they could be. And what I do notice, though, is that the idea of writing off Joseph's—the reality of his experience because there are other similar ones, it's bad logic. It's bad reasoning. It's a non sequitur, it does not follow. So if your first premise is there were lots of people—and there weren't lots. It was not terribly uncommon, but it also wasn't common, it's not 9 out of 10 people who are seeing the Father and the Son in the woods. It's one out of a who knows how many, but it's a small number, but probably enough that most people have heard of somebody, somewhere, in their recent past or lifetime that had an experience in their bedroom or in their law office or in the woods with a vision of some kind or other. So Joseph Smith's gets more concrete and more—he gets more emphatic over time as he describes it about the theological content of what happened. In other words, Joseph's vision leads, by his 1838-39 narration of it, to the establishment of the Church of Jesus Christ, and he—the more he's opposed by it and the more it goes counter to his culture, the more adamantly Joseph Smith affirms it.",1,

The prophet Joel anticipated that visions would increase in the last days, saying, ""Old men shall dream dreams, [and] young men shall see visions"" (Joel 2:28-32).

The Prophet Joseph Smith had his first vision at the age of fourteen while praying in a grove of trees in western New York (see First Vision). The appearance of the Lord to him, like that to Saul of Tarsus, was attended by a shining light from heaven (Acts 9:3). The Lord spoke face-to-face with Joseph and called him to service. This was the first of a series of visions Joseph Smith received, many of which were shared with other persons. Blessed like John on the isle of Patmos and Paul who spoke of the third heavens, the Prophet Joseph Smith affirmed, ""Could you gaze into heaven five minutes, you would know more than you would by reading all that ever was written on the subject"" (*TPJS*, p. 324; cf. *HC* 6:50).

The answer was astonishing. As he prayed in the woods near his house, the Father and the Son appeared to him. Assuring him that his sins were forgiven, the Lord told him that none of the churches were right and that he should join none. Latter-day Saints call this Joseph Smith's first vision, the initial event in the restoration of the gospel. At the time, it made little impression on the people around Joseph Smith. He told a minister about the vision and was rebuffed. Believing the Bible sufficient, ministers were skeptical of direct revelation. The scorn upset Joseph, who had only tried to report his actual experience, and alienated him still further from the churches.

After three years with no further revelations, Joseph wondered if he still was in favor with God and prayed again for direction and forgiveness. The vision he received on September 21, 1823, set the course of his life for the next seven years. An angel appeared and instructed him about a sacred record of an ancient people. This angel, Moroni 2, told Joseph that he was to obtain the record, written on gold plates, and translate it. He also told him that God's covenant with ancient Israel was about to be fulfilled, that preparation for the second coming of Christ was about to commence, and that the gospel was to be preached to all nations to prepare a people for Christ's millennial reign. In a vision Joseph saw the hill near his home where the plates were buried. When he went the next day to get the plates, the angel stopped him. He was told that he must wait four years to obtain the plates and that, until then, he was to return each year for instructions. On September 22, 1827, he obtained the plates from which he translated the Book of Mormon (see Moroni, Visitations of).",3,

It is the event that kicks off the entire story. But that's not necessarily the way Joseph Smith thought of it, and it's definitely not the way he presented it to the early Saints. He didn't. He presented to them being called of God when the angel Moroni came and called him to the work, right? God has a work for you to do, Moroni said. And Joseph being called to the work in his narrative starts with that. And that's how Mother Smith tells the story as well. So early saints didn't necessarily even know there was a First Vision. We might think that's impossible, or if there was a First Vision, he certainly would have told them, if there was a First Vision, they would have all known about it. Those are nothing but hypothetical assumptions. Zero historical evidence behind them. You can't use them to disprove the vision. All you're disproving is what you think should have happened if history happened the way you imagine it happened.

Someone at some point would surely have noticed if he was spending any significant amount of time reading or writing in preparation for his translation.16: 13. "") Yet there is no such reliable report from anyone inside or outside of Joseph's family.

Moreover, the destitute circumstances of the Smith family required long hours of ""continuous labor"" from all who were capable of work (Joseph Smith—History 1:55). As Rees has argued, the notion that ""Joseph had time to read broadly, undertake research, construct various drafts, and work out the plot, characters, settings, various points of view, and multiple rhetorical styles that constitute the five-hundred-plus page narrative of the Book of Mormon is simply incredible (in its original Latin sense of 'not worthy of belief').""17

With these circumstances in mind, we can more clearly understand why the Lord himself, through the voice of the prophet Isaiah, referred to the coming forth of the Book of Mormon as a ""marvelous work and a wonder"" (2 Nephi 27:26), and then set about to see that this prophetic description was fulfilled.",2,

""But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.""14

Believing those prophetic words and with unwavering, childlike faith, Joseph went to a grove of trees near his home and there knelt and prayed. Later he recorded:

""I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head. …

""… When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air.""15

Looking up at these two beings, even Joseph could not have known who They were—for he had not yet witnessed and learned the true nature of God and Christ. But then, he records, ""one of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—*This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!*""16

The fathers from Adam to Jacob are seen as Patriarchs of this order. The word ""patriarch"" is often used in the Bible as a title of honor for the early leaders of the Israelites. It is perhaps in this sense that Peter spoke of ""the patriarch David"" (Acts 2:29). Stephen spoke of the sons of Jacob as ""the Twelve Patriarchs"" (Acts 7:8-9). These men may have been natural Patriarchs, being fathers, and some of them may also have been ordained to the patriarchal priesthood. By right of this priesthood and under inspiration, they could confer upon their sons and daughters promises, privileges, and duties like unto those of the family of Abraham.

The Doctrine and Covenants speaks of ""evangelical ministers,"" which is understood to refer to Patriarchs. The Council of the Twelve Apostles has the responsibility of calling and ordaining stake Patriarchs ""as they shall be designated unto them by revelation"" (D&C 107:39). This responsibility is now generally delegated to stake presidents. A stake patriarch may also give patriarchal blessings outside his stake to members of his own family. If he moves to another stake, his jurisdiction there requires approval through the Council of the Twelve.

The training and preparation of Patriarchs includes spiritual enhancement through prayer and righteous living, constant study of the scriptural and historical heritage of the calling, and occasional meetings where they are instructed by their leaders.",3,

The promises given to Abraham and Sarah pertain to this same order.

Three principles underlie the patriarchal order. First, the primal parents of the race were in their paradisiacal state in Eden united in eternal bonds before death entered their lives. Second, the fall of man and the continual source of degeneration in this world have resulted in the estrangement of parents from God, from each other, and from their children. Third, the healing of this broken harmony is the essence of eternal life, as is the perpetuation of powers of creation and procreation-eternal increase.

The patriarchal order is, in the words of Elder James E. Talmage, a condition where ""woman shares with man the blessings of the Priesthood,"" where husband and wife minister, ""seeing and understanding alike, and cooperating to the full in the government of their family kingdom"" (*Young Woman's Journal* 25 [Oct. 1914]:602-603). A man cannot hold this priesthood without a wife, and a woman cannot share the blessings of this priesthood without a husband, sealed in the temple.",3,

Stake presidents must provide very careful, special watch care over the patriarch. You should have him sit on the stand and be recognized.

On regular occasions, perhaps twice a year, you should interview the patriarch and read some of his blessings. Remind him that each blessing should be individual and special to the member. The periodic reading of blessings must not be neglected by the stake president.

I once ordained a patriarch who was overcome with the responsibility. For months he could not get himself to give a blessing. Finally, he asked his stake president if he might write a paragraph as a model introduction to any patriarchal blessing. The stake president approved.

Later he told me this: ""When the first young man came for a blessing, because I had memorized this prepared introduction, I felt comfortable. I laid my hands on his head, and I did not use one word of it. That day I learned whose blessings they are. They are not my blessings but are dictated by the Spirit.""",3,

Priesthood authority functions in both the family and the Church. The priesthood is the power of God used to bless all of His children, male and female. Some of our abbreviated expressions, like ""the women and the priesthood,"" convey an erroneous idea. Men are not ""the priesthood."" Priesthood meeting is a meeting of those who hold and exercise the priesthood. The blessings of the priesthood, such as baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, the temple endowment, and eternal marriage, are available to men and women alike. The authority of the priesthood functions in the family and in the Church, according to the principles the Lord has established.

When my father died, my mother presided over our family. She had no priesthood office, but as the surviving parent in her marriage she had become the governing officer in her family. At the same time, she was always totally respectful of the priesthood authority of our bishop and other Church leaders. She presided over her family, but they presided over the Church.",3,

It brings temporal relief in times of hardship. It is also a laboratory outside of the home where we can serve, learn, and practice charity, the pure love of Christ.

I also found in this church that the priesthood has a patriarchal order and that God is a God of order. He is at the head, and following this pattern, the priesthood is conferred upon worthy men so they can preside in their homes and families. The husband and father, a patriarch, is to preside in righteousness and exercise the power of his priesthood to bless his wife and family. The husband and wife serve as partners in governing their family, and both act in joint leadership and depend on each other. They are united in the vision of their eternal salvation, one holding the priesthood, the other honoring and enjoying the blessings of it. One is not superior or inferior to the other. Each one carries his or her respective responsibilities and acts in his or her respective role.

Much more could be said about the priesthood and its uniqueness, the divine commission given to man through which he acts in the plan of salvation. In essence, therein is the true doctrine of the Father, the irreversible correct principles to govern ourselves, and the know-how to act upon the law and commandments that we were given.",2,

Approval is based on a desire and readiness to receive the blessing, and on personal worthiness as shown by faithfulness in the gospel and Church service. The blessing is given in a quiet setting, usually a room in the stake center or the home of the patriarch. Parents, a spouse, or other immediate family members may be invited to witness the blessing. The recipient is seated. The patriarch lays his hands on the head of the person and invokes the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. In the spirit of fasting and prayer all present are united in faith to seek inspired insight into the birthright blessings and destinies of the recipient. The patriarch also seeks inspiration to specify the dominant family line that leads back to Abraham. Then, as manifested by the Spirit, the patriarch gives admonitions, promises, and assurances.

The stake patriarch always records and transcribes the blessings he gives. The original copy is sent to the patriarchal division of the Church Historical Department. A copy given to the individual becomes a permanent record that is held sacred. It is usually available only to the recipient, or later to his family and descendants.

The appointment of stake Patriarchs does not preempt the calling and right of every father in the Church who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood also to give each of his children father's blessings. Both ordained Patriarchs and priesthood-bearing fathers have the power, through spiritual inspiration, to give a priesthood blessing that will look down the corridor of time and expand the vision, strengthen the faith, and clarify the life mission of the one receiving the blessing.

However, some writings of Joseph were recorded on the plates of brass, a scriptural record brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem by the prophet Lehi, and known among the Book of Mormon people. Another prophecy, restored by Joseph Smith, is now found in the Joseph Smith Translation (JST) Genesis 50.In this text, the ancient Joseph prophesied the bondage of his father's family in Egypt and their eventual deliverance by Moses, and specifically names him and his brother, Aaron. Moses was to deliver Israel from Egypt, have power over the Red Sea, receive commandments from God, and be assisted by Aaron as his spokesman (JST Gen. 50:24, 29, 34-35).

The same source indicates that the Lord visited Joseph, promising him a righteous posterity, a branch of which would be separated from their kindred and taken to a distant country (JST Gen. 50:25-26). According to the Bible, Jacob had already prophesied that Joseph's branches-Ephraim and Manasseh-would inherit the ""utmost bound of the everlasting hills"" (Gen. 49:26). Moses described the new land of their inheritance as containing riches of both heaven and earth (Deut. 33:13-15). The Book of Mormon records the partial fulfillment of these prophecies with the exodus of the families of Lehi, a descendant of Manasseh (Alma 10:3), and Ishmael, a descendant of Ephraim (JD 23:184), to the western continents. The Book of Mormon is called ""the stick of Ephraim"" in modern revelation (D&C 27:5) and both ""the stick of Ephraim"" and ""the stick of joseph"" (Ezek. 37:15-28,esp. verses 16 and 19).",1,

One of the questions asked, ""Was not Jo Smith a money digger,"" meaning somebody who was hired to locate buried treasure. To this, the Prophet answered ironically, ""Yes, but it was never a very profitable job to him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it.""1: 43. $14 in the 1820s was the equivalent to between $300–$380 in 2019, depending on the year, as calculated at https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation."")

Treasure-seekers wanted to employ him to help with their searches. One, a man named Josiah Stowell (sometimes spelled Stoal), hired Joseph and his father in 1825 to dig for a supposed Spanish treasure near harmony, pennsylvania. The effort came to nothing, and the Smiths returned home, but the neighbors continued to think of the Smiths as part of the treasure-seeking company.

In fact, he was probably only about seventeen to twenty years old when he was engaged to Mary.

Like Moses, he would bring forth the word of God (the Book of Mormon and other revelations), which would testify of, and sustain, other words of God that had already gone forth (the Bible), thereby confounding false doctrines and laying contentions to rest. As Moses would liberate Israel from Egyptian bondage, the ""choice seer"" of the last days would liberate them from the bondage of false traditions; as Moses would reveal a new covenant and prepare Israel to enter the Promised Land, so his latter-day counterpart would reveal a new and everlasting covenant and prepare modern Israel, the Church, for the day of Christ's millennial reign (JST Gen. 50:24-38; cf. 2 Ne. 3; JST Gen. 48:11).",1,

In fact, he was the very seer foreseen anciently by the earlier Joseph in Egypt! (See 2 Ne. 3:6–7, 16–18.)

In a prophetic father's blessing given in December 1834 to Joseph Smith, Jr., Father Smith confirmed those promises given the ancient Joseph, and pronounced added blessings, including these, upon young Joseph: ""Thy God has called thee by name out of the heavens … to do a work in this generation which no other man would do as Thyself."" The ancient Joseph ""looked after his posterity in the last days … And sought diligently to know … who would bring the word of the Lord [to them] and his eyes beheld thee, my son: [Joseph Smith, Jr.] his heart rejoiced and his soul was satisfied.""

Young Joseph also heard his father promise, ""Thou shalt like to do the work which the Lord shall command Thee."" (See 2 Ne. 3:8.)

Earlier, during the approximately ninety days of translating, Joseph was processing—and at a remarkable rate—truths and concepts of immense significance, beyond what was then his capacity. A few gems only from that treasure trove:

Could Joseph have been expected, for instance, to appreciate fully that, through him, would be given the only significant scriptural elaboration of one of the most fundamental and demanding declarations of Jesus?

""Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."" (Matt. 18:3.)

Through Joseph Smith's translation came these stunning, defining, and sobering words about what childlike and saintly submissiveness really means:

""A saint [is one who becomes] through the atonement of Christ the Lord … a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father."" (Mosiah 3:19.)",1,

Steeped in the language of the Bible and a mixture of Anglo-European cultures brought over by immigrants to North America, some people in the early 19th century believed it was possible for gifted individuals to ""see,"" or receive spiritual manifestations, through material objects such as seer stones.
>
>
> The young Joseph Smith accepted such familiar folk ways of his day, including the idea of using seer stones to view lost or hidden objects. Since the biblical narrative showed God using physical objects to focus people's faith or communicate spiritually in ancient times, Joseph and others assumed the same for their day. Joseph's parents, Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith, affirmed the family's immersion in this culture and their use of physical objects in this way, and the villagers of Palmyra and Manchester, New York, where the Smiths lived, sought out Joseph to find lost objects before he moved to Pennsylvania in late 1827.8

Potiphar soon recognized his worth and made him overseer over all that he had. The Bible says that ""Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured"" (Gen. 39:6).

Thus it was that his master's wife desired him, but Joseph refused her advances, and he fled from her. She caught hold of his cloak, which he left in her hand. This she used as evidence against him.

Her husband believed her lies and cast Joseph into prison, where he remained many years, when he was summoned before Pharaoh, the king.

It seems that the king had a dream which none of his wise men nor magicians could interpret, and someone remembered that Joseph had interpreted dreams while in prison which came to pass as predicted.

When Pharaoh related his dream unto Joseph, he was able to interpret it and to warn about the seven years of plenty to be followed by seven years of famine which were to come upon Egypt, and to give instructions to the king as to what he should do.

Joseph made it very clear that the interpretation came from God, who through this dream was directing Pharaoh. Because he knew that God was with Joseph, Pharaoh appointed him to be ruler over all the land of Egypt, and in this position he was later able to save his own family from starvation. I think you all know the story.

It's that – it's that ultimate enduo that the world has to offer, the very finest clothing.

The Bible is primarily a record of God's dealings with the forebears and descendants of Jacob or Israel in the ancient Near East. Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of God's dealings principally with another group of Israelites he brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem about 600 B.C. (see Lehi). They anticipated the birth and coming of Jesus Christ and believed in his Atonement and gospel.

This is not a condition the Lord desires, for the Apostle Paul declared that there is ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism"" (Ephesians 4:5). To help bring this oneness about, the Lord established a divine law of witnesses. Paul taught, ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Corinthians 13:1).

The Bible is one witness of Jesus Christ; the Book of Mormon is another. Why is this second witness so crucial? The following illustration may help: How many straight lines can you draw through a single point on a piece of paper? The answer is infinite.

Then read the Book of Mormon. It will teach you and testify to you that Christ's Atonement is infinite because it circumscribes and encompasses and transcends every finite frailty known to man. That is why the prophet Mormon declared, ""Ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ"" (Moroni 7:41).

No wonder the Book of Mormon proclaims with boldness, ""And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ"" (2 Nephi 33:10). Together with the Bible, the Book of Mormon is an indispensable witness of the doctrines of Christ and His divinity.

That the Book of Mormon stands strong after nearly 200 years of critical examination should bolster the confidence of those who accept it as inspired scripture and an authentic ancient record translated by the gift and power of God. Likewise, that skeptics have yet to offer a convincing counter-explanation for the existence of the Book of Mormon is strong evidence for its authenticity. This has, remarkably, not stopped dogmatic skeptics from ""look[ing] everywhere for explanations [for the Book of Mormon] except to the one explanation"" that was offered by Joseph Smith.32, 87, emphasis in original."")

Arguments that the Book of Mormon was derived from other nineteenth century books do not adequately explain its features—for example, its astounding narrative complexity, literary elegance, profound theology, and authentic ancient characteristics. Nor do such arguments account for the circumstances of its coming forth, including its rapid dictation, lack of revisions, and the testimonies of those who handled the plates and beheld the angel. The weight of the combined evidence affirms that the Book of Mormon is unlike any other nineteenth century work, and is an authentic ancient text. The testimony of the Holy Ghost given to sincere seekers ratifies this truth (Moroni 10:4–5).",3,

Anxious to meet the translator of the Book of Mormon, Brigham journeyed from New York to Kirtland, Ohio. ""When I went to Kirtland I had not a coat in the world,"" he recalled. ""Neither had I a shoe to my feet, and I had to borrow a pair of pants and a pair of boots.""2 Of meeting Joseph Smith, Brigham recalled, ""Here my joy was full at the privilege of shaking the hand of the Prophet of God, and receiving the sure testimony, by the spirit of prophecy, that he was all that any man could believe him to be as a true Prophet.""3

Brigham served missions and defended Joseph against persecutors no matter the personal inconvenience. When overhearing a man loudly rail against the Prophet one night, he didn't hesitate to jump in the fray:

>
> I put my pants and shoes on, took my cowhide, went out, and laying hold on him, jerked him round, and assured him that if he did not stop his noise and let the people enjoy their sleep without interruption, I would cowhide him on the spot, for we had the Lord's Prophet right here, and we did not want the devil's prophet yelling round the streets. The nuisance was forthwith abated.4

I did this because he's often seen as a stumbling block to members of the Church today due to some of the comments and policies we'll be discussing in this set of questions/concerns. I wanted to point out that he frequently exhorted the Saints to pray to receive their own revelation concerning the things he said, and to reject the things he taught if they felt they didn't come from God.

There are some other things we all need to know and understand about ""Brother Brigham"" before we can put these subjects in context, though. The first is that he had a very theatrical style, sort of like today's televangelists. He was fond of the old ""fire and brimstone"" style of preaching that was so common in his day, where he'd exaggerate and threaten damnation and the Saints going to Hell if they turned away from the Gospel, that kind of thing. He would also often act out the things he was saying—like if he was talking about searching for something, he'd stand there at the pulpit, checking all of his pockets like he couldn't find what he was looking for. The people loved it; it was like going to a show every time they watched him preach. It was very entertaining, and he would play up the theatrics while he was preaching in response to their reactions. But things like that don't always translate very well when you're reading them over a century later, so it's hard to tell when he was being serious and when he was playing to the crowd or exaggerating for effect.",1,

He left a copy with Brigham's oldest brother, Phineas, an itinerant preacher. Phineas was favorably impressed with the book and lent it to his father, then to his sister Fanny, who gave it to Brigham. Though impressed, Brigham nevertheless counseled caution: ""Wait a little while&#133;I [want] to see whether good common sense [is] manifest"" (*JD* 3:91; cf. 8:38). After nearly two years of investigation, Brigham, moved by the testimony of a Mormon elder, was baptized in the spring of 1832. All of Brigham's immediate family were also baptized, and they all remained loyal Latter-day Saints throughout their lives. Miriam, who also joined, lived only until September 1832.

One week after his baptism, Brigham gave his first sermon. He declared ""[After I was baptized] I wanted to thunder and roar out the Gospel to the nations. It burned in my bones like fire pent up, so I [commenced] to preach&#133;. Nothing would satisfy me but to cry abroad in the world, what the Lord was doing in the latter days"" (*JD* 1:313). Brigham felt the impulse to ""cry abroad"" so strongly that he enlisted the assistance of Vilate and Heber C. Kimball to care for his daughters and abandoned his trade to devote himself wholeheartedly to building the ""kingdom of God."" That fall, after Miriam's death, he, Heber Kimball, and several relatives traveled to Kirtland, Ohio, where he first met the twenty-six-year-old Prophet Joseph Smith. Invited to evening prayer in the Smith home, Brigham was moved by the Spirit and spoke in tongues, the first speaking in tongues witnessed by the Prophet.",1,

We landed in the spring of 1840, as strangers in a strange land and penniless. But through the mercy of God we have gained many friends, established churches and have left sown in the hearts of many thousands the seeds of eternal truth.""6

Brigham's darkest day was on June 27, 1844, the day the Prophet Joseph was killed in Carthage. Brigham wrote, ""Spent the day in Boston with brother Woodruff . . . In the evening, while sitting in the depot waiting, I felt a heavy depression of Spirit, and so melancholy I could not converse with any degree of pleasure. I could not assign my reasons for my peculiar feelings.""7 Twelve days later he learned the reason for his heavy depression: ""The first thing I thought of was whether Joseph had taken the keys of the kingdom with him from the earth.

There were a lot of people then as now who believed that they didn't have to accept plural marriage as being a commandment, and they could just put their heads down and ignore it and skate by without making that commitment to God in their hearts. Earlier in the sermon, he specifically said he was giving it to those who did not believe in the practice. He wasn't directing his words at everybody, but only those who refused to believe that plural marriage was a commandment from God.

Brigham was saying that, as hard as plural marriage could be to accept, this is something they (and we) had to support and believe was truly a commandment, whether they/we lived it or not. Accepting that is part of accepting the celestial marriage covenant, and if we only agree with part of the covenant, we may not reach the highest degree of exaltation in the next life that is possible if we do accept the entire covenant in full.",1,

His conversion reminds us of the important role of the Book of Mormon in missionary work, and the power of simple testimonies of its truthfulness. Like Brigham and the early Saints settling in the Salt Lake Valley and surrounding area, the Book of Mormon can be a guiding influence as we face challenges and go through transitions in our lives. For Brigham Young, the Book of Mormon ""formed one of the pillars on which he rested some of his most important teachings.""22 Today, we can likewise use the Book of Mormon as one of the pillars of our lives.

Brother Brigham's understanding that revelation—including the Book of Mormon translation—is tailored to the circumstances in which it is given remains important to understand today. After only approximately thirty years since the Book of Mormon had been published, according to President Young, a new divine translation would have differed noticeably. We should not be surprised, therefore, if the translated Book of Mormon contains phrases and imagery best suited for an early 19th century translation—such would be expected in order for the divine translation to most effectively communicate with the Lord's intended audience.

Brigham's teachings about the Book of Mormon and the Bible also remain relevant today. As Elder Russell M. Nelson recently reaffirmed, ""Love for the Book of Mormon expands one's love for the Bible and vice versa. … The Book of Mormon restores and underscores biblical doctrines such as tithing, the temple, the Sabbath day, and the priesthood.""23

Latter-day Saints throughout the world can and should appreciate the impact the Book of Mormon had on Brigham Young—and, in turn, the impact he had on the spread of that book throughout the world.",1,

Brigham Young was a complex individual with a lifetime of experiences, circumstances, and personality traits rubbing off on him that we've never experienced. He was highly theatrical when he was speaking and he loved to exaggerate to make a point, as he was surely doing with the scripture comment. The Saints of his day knew that, even if it's often lost in translation to us today.

Brigham Young taught correct, beautiful, true doctrine 98% of the time, but you don't see Jeremy pointing any of that out. He was also the prophet for more than 30 years. I guarantee you that in any given 30-year span of time, we'll all say things that we think are true but that ultimately turn out not to be.

As we went over a few weeks ago, Brigham believed that all knowledge was revelation from God. This included ideas, inspiration, facts, figures, and actual revelation. He believed everything that was taught to him was a revelation of some kind, given from God through various teachers and people he knew. When he said that God revealed the Adam-God theory to him, he almost certainly was not saying that it came in the form of a vision from God. In fact, he frequently said that *Joseph Smith* taught it to him, not God Himself. He apparently believed it was revealed by God *through* Joseph and, likely, also through his very close friend, Heber C. Kimball.",3,

Certainly, nobody ever labeled Brigham Young as such except for Jeremy. It was a preaching style, and Brigham was not telling us to go out and murder apostates. He was saying that apostatizing from the Church after making temple covenants was a grievously serious sin, and there may be no full repentance for that in the next life if you don't make amends while you still can in this one.

The statements we just went over regarding Brigham Young are some of them. Are Adam-God, Blood Atonement, and the Priesthood ban the sum of his teachings? Are they only notable things about him or the things he accomplished? Of course not. And yet, that's what he's reduced to in the CES Letter. So, how do we tell truth from fiction, or even half-truth? President Oaks gives us the answer to that, as well:

> *… Any contest between deception and truth pits Satan against the Holy Ghost. The scriptures teach us that ""Satan hath sought to deceive you that he might overthrow you"" (**D&C 50:3**), whereas, ""the Holy Ghost … will show you all things that ye should do"" (**2 Nephi 32:5**). ""And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things"" (**Moroni 10:5**).*

> *As members of the Church, we have the Gift of the Holy Ghost. If we will use our spiritual powers of discernment, we will not be misled by the lies and half-truths Satan will circulate in his attempts to deceive us and to thwart the work of God.*

This is what discernment truly is. It's the whispers of the Spirit that help you sense Gospel truth. It's not a warning light that flashes every time someone starts to lie. It takes practice to learn, and as President Oaks said in another talk, sometimes Church leaders have to learn how to tune it out in order to be effective in their callings.",0,

The Book of Mormon attempts to persuade all men and women that ""Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God"" (Book of Mormon Title Page) not only by describing the inspired teachings of ancient prophets who foretold his birth, life, ministry, Atonement, death, and Resurrection, but also by narrating the actual appearance of the resurrected Jesus to the ancient Nephites in the New World (3 Nephi 11–26). If these ancient prophets never existed, and if a resurrected Jesus never actually appeared to the ancient Nephites, then the Book of Mormon loses all its credibility as another testament of Jesus Christ.

Another proponent of the ""inspired fiction"" theory for the Book of Mormon has claimed that Joseph Smith utilized vast amounts of reworked biblical material to create ""new holy fictions.""14 In this way, this author alleged, Joseph Smith was the ""inspired author"" of the Book of Mormon because he created new fictional scripture in the same way that ancient biblical authors created fictional scripture.

Finally, another advocate for reading the Book of Mormon as ""inspired fiction"" has argued that the book was produced by a method called ""automatic writing."" Automatic writing is the phenomenon where texts are allegedly written with no conscious or deliberate effort, and instead are the result of the author's or scribe's subconscious or supernatural powers. If the Book of Mormon was produced in this manner, the argument goes, then Joseph Smith could not have been consciously attempting to deceive anyone. Therefore his integrity might remain intact, and the book might be read as inspired scripture while not having any historical authenticity.15",0,

It is evident that the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts provide evidence contravening modern theories of multiple authorship of Isaiah's book (see Isaiah: Authorship); for if the origins of the Isaiah material in the Book of Mormon are accepted as stated by its authors, then by 600 B.C. the book of Isaiah was essentially as it is today. The chief value of textual criticism, in this case, is to help identify special themes and language patterns, that is, to provide a better understanding of the message, not a determination of authorship. The most viable and certainly the most productive option for determining the origin of the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts is therefore an internal examination.",2,Joseph

Book of Mormon prophets taught from the brass plate records, not only from chapters 1-39, which are usually assigned by scholars to the prophet Isaiah of the eighth century B.C., but also from the later chapters, the so-called Deutero-Isaiah. For example, Isaiah chapters 48-54 are all quoted in the Book of Mormon, with some passages mentioned a number of times (1 Ne. 20-21; 2 Ne. 6:16-8:25; Mosiah 12:21-24;14;15:29-31; 3 Ne. 16:18-20;20:32-45;22).

The attraction derives primarily from the extensive use of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon. Secondarily, chapter 11 of Isaiah was quoted to Joseph Smith in a vision in his earliest days as a prophet (JS-H 1:40) and became the subject of a section in the Doctrine and Covenants (D&C 113). In addition, Jesus Christ has given revelations about, and prophets and apostles of the latter days have frequently quoted from and commented upon Isaiah's words when instructing the Saints.

Traditionally, the book of Isaiah has been ascribed to a prophet living in the kingdom of Judah between 740 and 690 B.C. In Germany during the late 1700s, several scholars challenged this view, claiming that chapters 40-66 were written by one or more other individuals as late as 400 B.C. because of the specific references to events that occurred after Isaiah's death. This outlook now permeates many Bible commentaries and has led to the postulation of a second prophetic writer who is commonly called in scholarly literature ""Deutero-Isaiah."" Indeed, a wide variety of theories regarding the date and authorship of Isaiah now exist. However, LDS belief in revelation and the seership of prophets, along with the quotations from Isaiah in the Book of Mormon and its admonitions to study his writings, have reinforced Latter-day Saints in the traditional view concerning the date and authorship of Isaiah, in the following ways.

First, while some scholars argue that prophets could not see the future and that, therefore, the later chapters of Isaiah must have been written after Isaiah's time (e.g., Isa. 45 concerning Cyrus), Latter-day Saints recognize that prophets can see and prophesy about the future. In chapters 40-66, Isaiah prophesies of the future, just as the apostle John does in Revelation 4-22,and the prophet Nephi 1 in 2 Nephi 25-30.",2,

Initially, some Church leaders encourage first-time readers to move through these chapters, understanding what is accessible and saving the rest for later study. In Isaiah's writings, Latter-day Saints find an important testimony of Christ and of the fulfillment of God's covenants with the house of Israel. Christ admonished his followers to ""search these things diligently, for great are the words of Isaiah"" (3 Ne. 23:11).

Another possible hurdle for readers is the book's nonchronological insertions. Nephi and Jacob and Jacob's descendants wrote first-person accounts from about 590 B.C. until about 150 B.C., and then Mormon (about A.D. 385) inserted a shorter chapter to explain his role as abridger of another record. Then the reader is returned via Mormon's abridgment to the history of Nephi's successors and of the descendants of Alma 1. As groups of people break away from and return to the main body, parts of their records are incorporated into the book, causing the reader to jump back to earlier events. Likewise, Moroni's abridgment of the very ancient book of Ether appears out of chronological order near the end. In addition, the Book of Mormon, like the Old Testament, describes events from widely separated intervals. As an abridgment, it contains only a small part of the proceedings of these ancient peoples.",3,

The numerous relationships between the two books also show us how the Nephites incorporated some of the timeless truths of Deuteronomy into their lives, teaching us how we can do the same.

For example, Deuteronomy tells us that good leaders should care more about knowing and keeping the commandments than they do about money or possessions (see Deuteronomy 17:14–20). King Benjamin clearly took this counsel to heart (see Mosiah 2:10–13). His life is an example of how we can apply Deuteronomy to ourselves and become better leaders. Another example is in Deuteronomy 31:9–13, which tells people that they should make the scriptures a focal point of their lives. Alma 5 gives practical ways in which people can make this ideal a reality in daily life.

Another doctrine, found in Deuteronomy 6:7–9, states that parents should teach the commandments ""diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up."" Alma 36–42 is an example of how Alma obeyed this commandment and shows us how we can fulfill this commandment today as well.

When we understand how the Nephites lived the commandments contained in Deuteronomy and applied its teachings to their own lives, we can have a better idea of how we can apply Deuteronomy to ourselves as well, allowing it to become an important source of insight into how we can live better lives today.",3,

When the Book of Mormon people left Jerusalem, they carried records on plates of brass that contained many Old Testament books predating 600 B.C., including Isaiah. Early in their narratives, Nephi 1 and his brother, Jacob, quoted extensively from Isaiah. Later, the resurrected Jesus admonished his hearers in the Americas to search the words of Isaiah diligently, for ""great are the words of Isaiah"" (3 Ne. 23:1).

Latter-day Saints see many of Isaiah's prophecies fulfilled in contemporary events. When the angel Moroni appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith on September 21-22, 1823, he quoted Isaiah 11 and said it was ""about to be fulfilled"" (JS-H 1:40). Isaiah 29 is also seen as a prophecy anticipating the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith's teachings contain many references to Isaiah, especially about the last days before the second coming of Christ. Additionally, Isaiah is often quoted in the Doctrine and Covenants (e.g., 45:10; 50:10-12; 64:34-35; 133), and in some cases interpretations are added (e.g., D&C 113).",3,

They are the only extant Isaiah texts that have no ""original"" language source with which the translation can be textually compared. These English texts date to the translation and initial publication of the Book of Mormon (1829).

These Isaiah texts were quoted and paraphrased by many Book of Mormon prophets who had a copy of Isaiah on the plates of brass. Attempts to determine the authenticity of those Book of Mormon Isaiah texts by comparing them with Hebrew, Greek, and Latin texts of Isaiah hold interest, but such efforts are moot because the ancient texts behind the Book of Mormon Isaiah translation are not available for study. However, much can be learned by comparing the numerous ancient versions and translations of Isaiah with the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts. Such comparisons result in granting the Book of Mormon Isaiah full recensional status.

The Isaiah materials in the Book of Mormon exhibit many similarities to those in the King James translation of the Bible, which would seem to indicate that both share a Hebrew Masoretic origin. However, many other peculiarities in the Book of Mormon texts point to an origin related to texts similar to those from which the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate were derived. These peculiar readings are significant enough that they preclude relegating the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts to being a mere copy of the King James Version. The Isaiah texts found in English translation in the Book of Mormon possess a distinctive character that indicates a unique textual origin. The important question is not, ""Are the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts authentic?""

But ""when the king had heard the words of the book of the law … he rent his clothes"" in grief, knowing that he and his people had not kept the laws in this book (vv. 11–13).

Included in the record were prophecies of Isaiah (1 Ne. 19:22-23; cf. 5:13). All of the Isaiah texts in the Book of Mormon are quotations from that record, except perhaps those cited by the risen Jesus (cf. 1 Ne. 16, 21- 22). Whether quoting directly or paraphrasing, Book of Mormon prophets were trying to do two things: ""persuade [people] to believe in the Lord their Redeemer"" (1 Ne. 19:23) and reveal the plans of God for his people, as noted by the prophet Isaiah (e.g., 2 Ne. 25:7; Hel. 8:18-20; 3 Ne. 23:1-2). These features give a singular quality to the Isaiah texts of the Book of Mormon, because it preserves almost exclusively the texts pertaining to salvation and saving principles and ignores Isaiah's historical material. The concerns of Book of Mormon prophets were doctrinal, and passages were utilized to expound their testimonies. Moreover, the passages that concern salvation from the later chapters of Isaiah are presented to show that Jesus was the promised Messiah (cf. Mosiah 13:33-15:31, which cites Isa. 53;52:7, 8-10). While nineteenth-century biblical scholarship held that the concept of a ""saving Messiah"" arose after the Babylonian exile (587-538 B.C.) and therefore the later chapters of Isaiah are to be dated to the end of the sixth century or later, the Book of Mormon texts obviously undermine that theory.",2,

The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants, modern LDS scriptures, confirm this assessment and contain extensive commentaries on his writings. The Book of Mormon quotes 425 verses and paraphrases many others from the book of Isaiah, taken from the plates of brass, a record brought to the Western Hemisphere by the prophet Lehi and his family (c. 600 B.C.). The Book of Mormon quotations from Isaiah are accompanied by the interpretations of Nephite prophets and the resurrected Jesus Christ. The Doctrine and Covenants likewise contains quotations and paraphrases of Isaiah, many illuminating the setting for and relevance of the fulfillment of his prophecies.

**THE BOOK OF MORMON.** The prophets in the Book of Mormon explicitly praise the writings of Isaiah and provide a thorough commentary thereon. Besides three early nephite prophets, Nephi 1, Jacob, and Abinadi, who quoted extensively from and explained the meanings of Isaiah, the resurrected Jesus Christ, when he visited the Nephites (A.D. 34), commanded his hearers to ""search these things diligently; for great are the words of Isaiah"" (3 Ne. 23:1). Most Book of Mormon citations of Isaiah concern two themes: (1) the testimony that Jesus Christ would come into the world to save it (1 Ne. 19:23; cf. 2 Ne. 9:5-12), and (2) pronouncements that even though the Lord would scatter Israel, he would gather and restore them, fulfilling the covenants that he made with Abraham and Israel (2 Ne. 6:5; cf. 9:1-2).",3,

President Cannon, for instance, wrote, ""there can be no harm result from the study of the geography of this continent at the time it was settled by Nephites, drawing all the information possible from the record which has been translated for our benefit.""17 Elder James E. Talmage said:

> The fact is, the Book of Mormon does not give us precise and definite information whereby we can locate those places with certainty. I encourage and recommend all possible investigation, comparison and research in this matter. The more thinkers, investigators, workers we have in the field the better; but our brethren who devote themselves to that kind of research should remember that they must speak with caution and not declare as demonstrated truths points that are not really proved.18

Ultimately, as several leaders have stressed, while the subject is of interest and has value, readers should not let it distract them from true purpose of the Book of Mormon. Elder Russell M. Nelson explained that he has ""read much that has been written about"" the Book of Mormon, including studies of ""its language structure or its records of weapons, geography, animal life, techniques of buildings, or systems of weights and measures."" Yet, ""Interesting as these matters may be, study of the Book of Mormon is most rewarding when one focuses on its primary purpose—to testify of Jesus Christ.""19",2,

Where were famous Book of Mormon cities, like Zarahemla and Bountiful, or the epic battlefields of the Nephites and Lamanites, such as Cumorah?

Interest in answering these questions began almost immediately after the Book of Mormon was published. Only months later, a group of missionaries, including Oliver Cowdery, were apparently telling people in Ohio that Lehi ""landed on the coast of Chile.""1, November 18, 1830, spelling modernized."") A couple of years later, W. W. Phelps linked the land of Desolation to the mid-western United States, ranging from the Mississippi to the Rocky Mountains.2 The next year, Phelps got ahold of reports about ancient ruins in Guatemala with stones ""cemented by mortar,"" and argued that this find was ""good testimony in favor of the Book of Mormon,"" specifically the account in Helaman 3:3–11.3

Clearly, for early Latter-day Saints, events in the Book of Mormon were believed to have spanned the entire Western Hemisphere. Any and all ancient or pre-Columbian ruins and artifacts found throughout North, Central, and South America (known as a ""hemispheric"" geography approach) were quickly accepted as evidence of Book of Mormon peoples. Even Joseph Smith was not above the fray. In a letter to Emma while marching with Zion's camp in 1834, Joseph Smith described their travels as ""wandering over the plains of the Nephites"" and ""picking up their skulls & their bones, as a proof of its divine authenticity.""4,"" KnoWhy 336 (July 7, 2017)."")",1,

While questions of geography are far from settled, our understanding of the book's physical setting has improved thanks to the increasingly more rigorous work of many scholars interested in questions of Book of Mormon geography. For example, today most proposals focus only on a specific area or region of the American continent, because more careful study has made it clear that the scope of Book of Mormon lands must be limited.13, 55–81. Already in 1903, some were disputing proposals for Book of Mormon geography on the grounds that ""students could not reconcile the statements as to time consumed in traveling from one place to another with Zarahemla being at the point claimed by him."" See ""Book of Mormon Students Meet: Interesting Convention Held in Provo Saturday and Sunday,"" Deseret Evening News, May 25, 1903; reprinted in Journal of Book of Mormon Studies 22, no. 2 (2013): 109.

Roberts suggested, ""the physical description relative to the contour of the lands occupied by the Jaredites and Nephites … can be found between Mexico and Yucatan with the Isthmus of Tehuantepec between,"" but ultimately continued to promote a hemispheric view.

To members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Book of Mormon forms the doctrinal foundation of the Church and speaks the word of God to all the world.

The Book of Mormon both confirms and supplements the Bible: ""Behold, this [the Book of Mormon] is written for the intent that ye may believe that [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe [the Book of Mormon] also"" (Morm. 7:9). The Bible is primarily a record of God's dealings with the forebears and descendants of Jacob or Israel in the ancient Near East. Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of God's dealings principally with another group of Israelites he brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem about 600 B.C. (see Lehi). They anticipated the birth and coming of Jesus Christ and believed in his Atonement and gospel. Their complex, lengthy records were abridged by a prophet named Mormon, inscribed on plates of gold, and buried by his son, Moroni 2, after internecine wars destroyed all of the believers in Christ in the New World except Moroni (A.D. 385).",2,

Three mutually supportive avenues are most often followed. First, the book serves as a source of guidance and doctrine, yielding lessons and wisdom applicable to contemporary life. This approach is recommended in the writings of Nephi, who wrote that he ""did liken the scriptures unto [his people], that it might be for [their] profit and learning"" (1 Ne. 19:23). Latter-day Saints find its pages rich with ennobling narratives, clear doctrines, eternal truths, memorable sayings, and principles. Knowing the conditions of the latter days, the ancient prophets periodically address the individual reader directly. Latter-day Saints emphasize the need to read the Book of Mormon prayerfully, with faith in God, to benefit personally from its teachings and to come unto Christ.

A second approach to the Book of Mormon, adding historical dimension to the first approach, is to study the book as an ancient text. The reader who accepts the Book of Mormon as an ancient Hebrew lineage history written by prophets in the New World will find the book consistent with that description and setting. The book is a repository of ancient cultures that are as far removed from modern readers as are those of the Old and New Testaments. Continuing research has found Hebrew poetic forms, rhetorical patterns, and idioms, together with many Mesoamerican symbols, traditions, and artifacts, to be implicit in the book or consistent with it.",2,

The central event in the Book of Mormon is the appearance of the resurrected Christ to righteous inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere after his ascension into heaven at Jerusalem. During his visit, Christ delivered a sermon that is similar to the Sermon on the Mount recorded in the New Testament, but with certain vital clarifications and additions. He declared his doctrine, the fulness of his gospel necessary to enter the kingdom of God; and he established his Church with its essential ordinances, and ordained disciples to preside over the Church. At this time, Christ also explained the promises of God to Israel; healed the sick and disabled; blessed the children and their parents; and expressed his great love, allowing each individual to come forward and touch the wounds he had received during his crucifixion (see 3 Ne. 11-26). The record of Jesus' visit and many other passages in the Book of Mormon verify the divine sonship, ministry, Atonement, resurrection, and eternal status of the Lord Jesus Christ and show that the fulness of his gospel is the same for all people, whenever and wherever they have lived.",3,

In the months following Joseph's martyrdom, Brigham Young and the Quorum of the Twelve emerged as the most prominent leaders of the Church, especially because Joseph had rolled the authority of leadership onto the Twelve three months before his death.6: 5–19. This was confirmed a year later (Council of Fifty, Minutes, March 1844–January 1846; Volume 1, 10 March 1844–1 March 1845, p. 51, online at josephsmithpapers.org)."") However, tensions between Emma and Brigham Young arose. Historian Jenny Reeder recounts, ""Both Emma and Brigham Young were fiercely dedicated to Joseph for different reasons: he was committed to seeing the future success of the Church, while she was devoted to preserving her fatherless family.""7, 163."") Emma also had a complex relationship with plural marriage. Sources indicate that Emma participated in several plural marriages, but later in her life she appeared to deny her participation in or acquiescence to the practice.8",3,

Unable to condone continuation of the practice of plural marriage or the leadership of Brigham Young, who supported it, and ambivalent about the proper line of succession to her husband, Emma made her first priority after her husband's death the preservation of an inheritance for her five living children. Distinguishing Joseph's personal property from that of the Church defied easy solution, however, and involved Brigham Young and Emma Smith in a series of complex and often bitter legal entanglements. Brigham Young, as president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and steward of the Church, claimed all that he felt rightfully belonged to its members. Emma Smith, as guardian of Joseph's children, just as vigorously claimed their share, to which she had contributed throughout her marriage to Joseph. Unable to reach an amicable solution and unwilling to accept plural marriage even in principle, Emma elected to remain in Nauvoo with her family while Brigham Young led the majority of Church members to the Rocky Mountains in 1846. On December 23, 1847, Emma Smith married Lewis Bidamon, a non-Mormon, further estranging her from the Church, to which she had once been known as the Elect Lady.

Most of the Saints had left Nauvoo by the time of the marriage, but Almon Babbitt, a Church leader left behind in Nauvoo to oversee Church interests, confronted Emma, accosting her about her decision to marry outside of the faith.10 Emma and Lewis never had children together, but he acted as a surrogate father to the Smith children. This and many other factors continued to widen the rift in the years following.

As the years continued, Emma and her oldest son, Joseph III, accepted leadership roles in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (today called the Community of Christ), with Joseph Smith III serving as president of that organization from 1860 to 1914.11."") A few days before her death, Emma was interviewed by Joseph III, recalling many vital details about the early Church but also denying the practice of plural marriage.12, 65–69. Two of her sons, Alexander and David, came to Salt Lake City as RLDS missionaries in 1869 and were shown affidavits relating to Joseph's commencement of eternal sealings of husbands, wives, and children, including plural marriages.

At Brigham's invitation, Lucy spoke at a general conference of the Church in October 1845 and expressed a desire to travel to the West but said that her health would not permit her to go.16, 26."") In poor health and crippled by arthritis, Lucy depended on the support of Emma and of her own daughters Katherine, Sophronia, and Lucy, who also remained in the area for the rest of their lives.17."") Lucy later spoke tenderly of Emma's care for her, noting that on one occasion ""for five nights Emma never left me; but stood at my bedside all the night long.""18

Finally, Emma had endured terrible trials and saw Nauvoo as a safe haven for her family after Joseph's death. On one occasion she wrote to Joseph III saying of Nauvoo, ""It is my home, and my children's home, and I shall not cease to pray that they all may live to enjoy it.""19 Emma was visited a number of times by members of the Church from Utah. During one such visit, she told her visitors, ""You may think I was not a very good Saint not to go West but I had a home here and did not know what I should have done there.""20

When Emma died, she was surrounded by her family and friends. Her son Alexander heard her say, ""Joseph, Joseph, Joseph."" He said that Emma then sat up in her bed, extended her left arm, and said, ""Yes, I am coming,"" before she collapsed back on her bed. Emma passed away on April 30, 1879.21",1,

During the Missouri persecutions of 1838–1839, Emma was forced to flee from that state with her children while Joseph Smith languished in Liberty Jail. Lucy Mack Smith, the mother of the Prophet, recorded this tribute to Emma:

> I have never seen a woman in my life, who would endure every species of fatigue and hardship, from month to month, and from year to year, with that unflinching courage, zeal and patience, which she has always done. … She has breasted the storm of persecution, and buffeted the rage of men and devils, until she has been swallowed up in a sea of trouble which [would] have borne down almost any other woman.1

After Joseph Smith's death in 1844, Emma remained in Nauvoo for the rest of her life rather than traveling on with the Saints, and for several years she did not associate herself with any of the groups linked to the Restoration. Why did Emma stay in Nauvoo after Joseph's death?

Emma was devastated at the death of Joseph Smith. According to one witness, when she saw Joseph's body, she spoke softly to him, saying, ""Oh, Joseph, Joseph! My husband, my husband! Have they taken you from me at last!""2, 197."") At the time of Joseph's death, Emma was pregnant with their last child and left to care for four young children alone. Going anywhere would have been extremely difficult. She was also left without much financial support, and she worried about how she could provide for her family (although in Nauvoo, she had a substantial home and considerable property). Legal claims regarding Joseph's estate and Emma's legal rights as Joseph's widow remained to be sorted out—a process that would take over eight years to complete.3."")",2,

She shared the Nauvoo House, her final home, with relatives and friends and basked in the love and care of her children and grandchildren. She continued to live her life with genteel qualities, meeting adversity and difficulty with grace and equanimity. She was polite to the ""Utah Mormons"" who occasionally visited, but was firm in her decision to remain apart from them.

Though Emma was publicly criticized by Church leaders for her failure to remain faithful to her husband's mission, she was sympathetically remembered by some of her former Nauvoo friends. Many of them, unlike Emma, had found the courage to accept the doctrine of plural marriage. ""I know it was hard for Emma, and any woman to enter plural marriage in those days,"" wrote Emily Partridge Young, a plural wife, ""and I do not know as anybody would have done any better than Emma did under the circumstances"" (*Woman's Exponent* 12 [Apr. 1, 1884]:165).

In 1892 at the jubilee celebration in Salt Lake City of the founding of the Nauvoo Relief Society, a motion to hang a life-size portrait of Emma Smith in the Tabernacle brought mixed responses from the Relief Society board members. To settle the question, Relief Society president Zina D. H. Young took the matter to Church President Wilford Woodruff, who replied that ""anyone who opposed it [hanging the portrait in the Tabernacle] must be very narrow minded indeed"" (Emmeline B. Wells Diary, March 11, 1892, HDC). Fifty years had softened bitter memories, and Emma Smith could once again be honored as a leader of women and remembered for the essential part she had played in the restoration of the gospel and the support she gave her Prophet-husband through the difficult years of his ministry.

In general conferences of the Church, the most frequently cited scriptures from the book of Hebrews are those concerning the Godhead (Heb. 1:1-3;12:9;13:8); the obedient suffering of Jesus (Heb. 2:14-18;4:15-16;5:8-9; *see also* Atonement of Jesus Christ); the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ (Heb. 7-8); how one must be called by God in order to hold the priesthood (Heb. 5:1-4); the nature of true faith, which motivates people to righteous action (Heb. 11); going on ""unto perfection"" (Heb. 6:1); and enduring to the end (Heb. 12:4-11). These themes are essential pillars of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

The main point at the center of the epistle is that Jesus Christ is the eternal ""high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle"" of God (Heb. 8:1-2). This theme is developed throughout the epistle, showing how eternal salvation comes through the greatness, sufficiency, and supremacy of Jesus Christ. The letter was written to devoted converts from Judaism to the early Christian church, who already understood the first principles of the gospel and had received its basic ordinances (Heb. 6:1-4). Step by step, it systematically strives to persuade them ""to hold fast to their faith"" (Buchanan, p. 266), to keep the covenant, and to realize the incomparable hope and irrevocable promises given to them by God through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. With its explication of the Atonement in terms of priesthood, oaths, covenants, and temple imagery, this entire epistle resonates and harmonizes with LDS concepts and practices.",1,Joseph

This—if you've ever been in a situation where you feel kind of giddy, you're so excited with anticipation, that's how we feel getting ready to jump into this epistle to the Hebrews. It is loaded. It is one of my favorite books in the New Testament. And let me just, let me begin with a 30,000 foot overview of what the epistle to the Hebrews is. You ready? That's it. The greater than sign. That's it. The entire book, what it's showing is that Jesus Christ is greater than or superior to everything that the recipients of this letter hold near and dear to their hearts. The Hebrews—we don't know where these people are living specifically. We don't know exactly when this epistle was written. We don't even know who specifically wrote it. It says ""The Epistle Paul the Apostle.""

But you'll notice, it's one of the longer epistles of all of them contained in the New Testament, and yet it comes after Philemon which is the shortest—Romans being the longest of Paul's Epistles—which tells us that even when the Bible was put together, there was some uncertainty as to, is this really Paul? Because it doesn't have some of the fingerprints of Paul, like his introduction at the beginning: Paul an apostle unto you. He doesn't give his name, ever, the author.

We have now read all of his epistles. Imagine the book of Hebrews being what Paul—this is my imagination here—imagine this is what he would have taught people verbally when he was with them. And so when he's now not with them, and we had all those other epistles where he's trying to correct and fix contention and disorder, it's lovely that we now have what may have been a common sermon from Paul about how people can understand Jesus Christ—things that we don't typically get in other Pauline writings because he's trying to address specific issues in different words around the Mediterranean Basin who've already received this message.

And by the way, just as another side note on the Paul point. If you're Paul and you're trying to convince judaizers of the supremacy of Christ and you want to persuade people and move the needle, per se, you probably don't want to introduce yourself and you probably want to get somebody who's really good with the Greek, so that people can't tell it's you giving the message because Paul isn't the most popular.

As a separate and distinct personage in the Godhead, he is the God of creation and the perfect revelation of godhood for all time. He is the express image of his Father, both spiritually and physically; he alone purged the sins of mankind and sits on the right hand of God the Father (Heb. 1:1-3). The Father brought the Savior (who was his ""firstbegotten"" in the premortal existence) ""into the world"" (Heb. 1:6; cf. D&C 93:21; 1 Ne. 11:18). As the firstborn, Jesus is the heir of all things (Heb. 1:2), and those who are faithful become joint-heirs with him (see Heirs).

Chapter 2 holds a strong warning to heed the word of God given through Jesus Christ (Heb. 2:1-4). The next world is in subjugation to Christ alone (Heb 2:5-10). God made him a little lower than ""the gods"" (taking the marginal reading of Ps. 8:4-6). Because God is the Father of all, even Christ is subject to him. Christ is second only to the Father, yet he is the spirit brother of mankind (Heb. 2:17). Like his brothers and sisters in mortality, he suffered temptation, but unlike them, he never sinned (Heb. 2:18;4:15-16). Through this suffering, he learned obedience and gained compassion for all God's children.",2,

Faith is the actual substance or substantiation or assurance (*hypostasis* ) and the evidence or evincing (*elenchos* ) of things not seen that are true (Heb. 11:1; Alma 32:21). True faith necessarily manifests itself in works of righteousness. Chapter 12 thus exhorts the faithful to endure the chastening and correction of God, who is the Father of their spirits. By inheriting the blessings of eternity as sons of the living God, his Saints are able to come to the new Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, being made perfect, an assembly of ""firstborns"" (*prototokon* ), having inherited all with the Firstborn.

Chapter 13 concludes by noting that ""marriage is honourable in all,"" and by counseling all to ""let brotherly love continue,"" to ""be without covetousness,"" and to be loyal to Jesus alone, ""bearing his reproach, for here [on earth] have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come"" (Heb. 13:1, 4-5, 13-14). Those who enter into this holy order and keep its covenants prepare themselves for eternal life, and fulfillment of the invocation that ""the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will"" (Heb. 13:20-21).

And you'll just see the richness that is packed into the book, this epistle to the Hebrews, and you'll see these powerful connections between the Old Testament and the New Testament to make this case really clear.

Paul and others, whoever is responsible for this book, they knew the Old Testament extremely well, and they're using examples and words and phrases and snippets and snatches from the Old Testament, peppered throughout this entire epistle. Notice verse 9 and 10: ""There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his."" So that's something that the Old Testament Law of Moses would teach very clearly, and they all get this. But look at verse 11: ""Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.""",1,

Gal. 2-3; Rom. 2-5). Early on, Paul had taught his gentile converts that they did not need to live the Law of Moses in order to be justified before God. It was sufficient to make and keep the gospel covenant, the covenant of faith, to do this, while outward observance of the Law of Moses was not (Gal. 2:16). In particular, after Christ's Atonement, there was no longer any necessity of observing the earlier law and covenant of Moses, which were rendered obsolete by the law and covenant of the gospel (cf. Heb. 8:6-13; 3 Ne. 9:17-20). Thus, Paul's Gentile converts did not need to become Jews in order to become Christians (cf. Acts 15:5-29), for human beings are ""justified by faith without the deeds of the law"" (Rom. 3:28). A complete commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ, the covenant of faith, automatically fulfills all previous obligations before God, including the obligations of the Law of Moses.",3,

Most of his epistles in the New Testament follow fairly standard literary forms of Paul's time, which has led one New Testament scholar to note that they ""are generally among the clearest"" of the New Testament writings to outline.1: 3."")

However, Paul's second letter to the Corinthians is much more difficult to outline, and many scholars point to its ""unparalleled lack of apparent structure and unity,"" especially in the beginning of the letter.2 Because of this, many scholars believe that 2 Corinthians is actually a combination of two or more letters that were put together by a later scribe or editor sometime after Paul had written them. However, as evangelical scholar Craig Blomberg has noted, many of these apparent discrepancies in the letter can be resolved when the first seven chapters are read as a large chiasm focused on the Atonement of Jesus Christ.3. For reference and discussion of Blomberg's work, see Neal Rappleye, ""Chiasmus Criteria in Review,"" in Chiasmus: The State of the Art, 292–293."")

Biblical scholars have long recognized the use of chiasmus in the ancient world, especially among ancient Israelites. Paul, having been taught in the Jewish law and having been raised as a Jew, would have likewise been familiar with this literary practice. Indeed, as John W. Welch has observed, Paul used chiasmus to various extents throughout some of his other epistles, such as Galatians and 1 Corinthians.4, 213–219. For additional examples of chiasmus in Paul's epistles, see pp. 213–229."") As such, it should be no surprise that Paul could use chiasmus in a profoundly complex and meaningful ways.",2,

Now, as we dive in we're going to be reading as we always do in English. The amazing thing here is—and I'm not a Greek expert. Taylor, you know a lot better Greek than I do. But talking to people, my colleagues who are Greek experts, they say: hands down, among the 27 books of the New Testament, the Hebrews, the Epistle to the Hebrews, contains the most polished and most poetic and most beautifully formed Greek of any of the other 26—the other 26 books in the New Testament. It is just beautifully written. Including verse 1.

If you look at this example on the screen, from Greek bible.com, of Hebrews chapter 1 verse 1. You'll notice that there are a whole series of words that start with the letter Pi, or English P. Which isn't an overly used letter in Greek. So whoever's doing the actual writing, taking the ideas, whether they come from Paul or whether they come from a committee of people or whether some person on their own taking all of those other writings and creating this book on their own (we don't know), but whoever it is, they are a master of the Greek language, using alliteration. Look at how many words in verse 1 start with the letter Pi. That's highly unusual.

This is more of a general epistle pushing back against judaizers and everything that they hold so sacred from the Old Testament and from the old law of Moses. This book is showing the supremacy and the majesty of Jesus Christ as being greater than all of those things.

So it turns out the first four verses give that as a very clear thesis statement. And then, it turns out, the chapters are broken up, identifying really amazing things from the Old Testament. You have angels; Jesus is better than them or superior. You have Moses and Mount Sinai; Jesus is superior. You have priests and Melchizedek; Jesus is superior. You have the whole sacrificial system that was meant to point people to Jesus Christ; He is superior. So as you read through these chapters you're looking for all the really amazing things. We should not denigrate them from the Old Testament. But ultimately, we will see that Jesus Christ surpasses them all.

Latter-day Saints are interested that, in replacing Judas, one apostle was chosen to complete the Twelve and that Peter set the qualifications of apostles: They must know the ministry of Jesus, they must be ordained, and they must be witnesses of his resurrection (Acts 1:21-22). Latter-day apostles in the Church are also ""special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world"" (D&C 107:23; cf. 27:12; 84:108). In addition, the book of Acts indicates the rich outpouring of the Holy Ghost in the early Church, both in the form of guiding revelation and in manifestations of the gifts of the spirit, characteristics that Latter-day Saints experience and value. Further, certain prophetic statements have particular meaning. For example, Latter-day Saints understand Paul's prophecy to the elders of Ephesus concerning mutinous problems within the early Church to be an inspired declaration about the impending apostasy (Acts 20:29-30). Moreover, they view Peter's prediction of Jesus' return from heaven at ""the times of restitution of all things"" as commencing with the latter-day restoration of the gospel (3:19-21). Further, the book of Acts has a good deal to say about the organization, doctrines, and character of the preaching of the early Christian church.

**THE EPISTLES.** Letters in the New Testament are traditionally divided into two groups, the writings of Paul and the general epistles.

The style of Paul's writings varies from the almost formal exposition in Romans to the charming persuasion in Philemon.",2,

Latter-day Saints believe that if a more complete collection of Paul's letters had survived, it would reflect a theology much like that of the restored gospel of latter days. They see support for this in the number of references in Paul to doctrines that are now peculiar to the Latter-day Saints, such as baptism for the dead (1 Cor. 15:29), the three degrees of glory (1 Cor. 15:39-41; 2 Cor. 12:2), the premortal life (Eph. 1:4), and the necessity of an ecclesiastical organization that includes apostles and prophets (Eph. 2:19-20;4:11-13). Latter-day Saints assume that Paul did not expand on these topics in his extant writings because they were written to people who already knew about them.",1,

No other early Apostle has had the impact on subsequent believers through both his personal example and his written words that Paul has. The early Christian apostle to the Gentiles, in his New Testament letters, produced a rich source of Christian doctrine and the single most important doctrinal influence upon many of the denominations of modern Christendom. Without Paul, the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ would be largely missing from the Bible, and considerably less would be known about grace, the Lord's Supper, church structure, the Apostasy, or the role of gifts of the spirit in the Church.

**BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.** Details of Paul's life are found in his letters and in the book of Acts. Born in Tarsus of Cilicia (modern southeastern Turkey), Paul was multicultural. As a Jew, he was known by the name of Saul and was educated in Jerusalem as a Pharisee under the famous rabbi Gamaliel. He was also a Roman citizen by birth, a rare privilege for a Jew at that time. Finally, he was familiar with Greek language and culture through his early environment in the Hellenistic city of Tarsus. Thus, he was able to deal with Jews, Romans, and Greeks on their own cultural terms-a great advantage for his later missionary work.",3,

The University of Utah was chartered in 1850 by our pioneer forebears. Brigham Young University came along later, outlasting most of the Church academies. It has grown until its present enrollment numbers more than 27,000. That is a large number of students, but it is a very small fraction of the young people of the Church worthy of a university education. We can accommodate only a relatively few. If we cannot give to all, why should we give to any? The answer is that if we cannot give to all, let us give to as many as we can. The number who can be accommodated on campus is finite, but the influence of the university is infinite. Tremendous efforts are being made to enlarge and extend that influence.",1,

""Utah stands first in the nation in the total population ages 3 to 34 enrolled in school.

""Utah stands first in the percentage of the total population enrolled in school at every age level except ages 16–17, where Minnesota ranks first. …

""Utah stands first in the average years of school completed for all of its citizens age 25 and older. …

""Utah stands first in expenditures on the operating programs of medical schools per $100,000 of personal income in the state.""

And then he said this: ""The Carnegie Commission on Higher Education surveyed the performance of higher education in each of the 50 states. It found Utah, unlike many states, to have no major deficiencies.""

Remarkable, isn't it?

Then he asked, ""Why has Utah done so well? It is neither the richest, nor the oldest, nor the best located state for educational development. If one could find its secret, perhaps it could be exported elsewhere. But this is not easy, for its secret, I think, is its history. Your early leaders placed a great emphasis on education.""

Then later they were sent up into Idaho, where a sawmill and a gristmill were needing to be built. My father's family had settled in Farmington, Utah, part of this colonization that I'm referring to—the colonization that made people stronger and gave them opportunities. Rather than being lost in a big city, they were asked to move to a smaller community where they could develop their ability and where there would be more schools and a need for more schoolteachers and where people with talent would develop their ability. Out of all of this, my family were asked to leave Farmington and Tooele, to sell their green acres, and go out into southern Idaho, where there was nothing at that time but sagebrush.

In a little settlement of that kind, my mother and father fell in love. By the time they were 20 years old and ready to be married, where would they be married? In the Logan Utah Temple. How would they get there? By buggy. How long would it take? Well, five or six or seven days. Highways and good roads? Of course not. They went by roads made by wagons going over the sagebrush and through the bushes and over the rocks. Where would they be married? Where would they be sealed? Only one place—the temple. They went by buggy.

That became part of my heritage. And so people grew up in these little towns. Then the Church decided to open some academies, and they opened some 30 of them out in these areas far away. One of those little academies was opened in our town, and it became an area where many from neighboring areas would move into that little town to get a higher education. Of course, the higher education was only a high school, but it was referred to as an academy.",1,

I almost become angry when I hear of complaining among the students or the faculty. I am grateful to be able to say that with very few exceptions those who come to learn and those who teach are appreciative and mindful of the great blessing that is theirs.

Moreover, the university has brought much favorable notice to the Church. Its sponsoring organization, the Church, is widely recognized. It has become known for standards and ideals which have been written about and talked about and which have let the world know of those things in which we believe. Its academic programs and its athletic programs have both brought honor to the university and the Church. And as generations of students move through its halls and on to graduation and then out across the world, they will bring honor to their alma mater and its sponsor, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

We shall continue to support BYU and its Hawaii campus. We shall continue to support Ricks College. We are not likely to build other university campuses. We wish that we might build enough to accommodate all who desire to attend. But this is out of the question. They are so terribly expensive. But we shall keep these as flagships testifying to the great and earnest commitment of this Church to education, both ecclesiastical and secular, and while doing so prove to the world that excellent secular learning can be gained in an environment of religious faith.

Backing up these institutions will be our other schools, our institutes of religion, scattered far and wide, and the great seminary system of the Church.

It is hoped that through these our youth, wherever they may be, may experience some of the good to be had at BYU.

If they wanted statehood, which they did and which Brigham felt very strongly about, they couldn't pass any anti-slavery laws.

The specific intent of the slavery laws in Utah (there were two, one for black people and one for Native Americans, passed within a month of each other) was to eventually lead to the complete elimination of slavery. Slavery in Utah was a step between the slavery of the South and indentured servitude.

There were some differences between the two laws, but basically, slaves had to come into the territory willingly and couldn't be sold or forced to move out of the territory if they didn't want to be. There were term limits on the contracts and education was required for all slaves. If masters slept with their slaves, even if it was consensual, or they neglected to feed, clothe, or shelter them, or if they abused the slaves, the contracts were null and void and the slaves were to be freed. There were also fines and potential prison sentences for the masters if they violated their contacts. There were legal recourses for the slaves and term limits imposed, which was very different from Southern slavery, and more akin to indentured servitude.

Obviously, some people abused these laws and looked for loopholes and other people were treated very badly, but the intent was to be better than those in the South and to eventually eliminate the practice from the territory.",1,

Religious persecution of the 1830s and 1840s in the more populated eastern states necessitated the movement of the Latter-day Saints to the West, where they could be more isolated. The Prophet Joseph Smith had designated Jackson County, Missouri, on the fringes of civilization, as the Zion of the latter days. However, continued persecution in Ohio, in Missouri, and later in Illinois caused the Latter-day Saints to seek a refuge in the Rocky Mountains, farther to the west, where they could worship God and practice their religious beliefs in the absence of religious bigotry, in land claimed by Mexico. To approximately 80,000 LDS pioneers who gathered from many nations and traveled across the great American desert by wagons before the advent in 1869 of the railroad, and to the thousands who followed afterward, the LDS presence in the Salt Lake Valley was compared to a fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy of the latter days, the City of God, established in the top of the mountains where people from all nations could gather to the House of the Lord to learn his ways (Isa. 2:1-3). To the Latter-day pioneers, President Brigham Young's words expressed their feelings: ""This is the place.""

The seventeen-mile-wide by twenty-five-mile-long Salt Lake Valley is some 4,500 feet above sea level and is surrounded by towering mountain peaks of the Wasatch Range that rise to over 11,000 feet. The valley is part of the Great Basin, where river waters are kept from flowing into the Pacific Ocean by high mountains. Lake Bonneville once lay within the Great Basin, and geologists say that it measured 1,000 feet deep where Salt Lake City is now located. The current Great Salt Lake is the evaporation remnant of that inland sea.",3,

He had the genius to have people go out and look for the valleys and the areas away from Salt Lake City where the pioneers who would pour into this valley could go and settle and make their homes and build cities and communities and build their personalities and their characters and develop the talents that would be theirs. So rather than having a large city in Salt Lake, under his leadership some 360 communities were developed out in Wyoming and Nevada and Arizona and southern Idaho as well as in Utah.

As people moved out and set up in these little communities, they developed their talents and abilities by serving on school boards and on town councils or became leading people in a little town. They became citizens of that area, and they started building schools and expanding those communities. We see what has happened in these areas that Brigham Young envisioned and which he helped set in motion. Just think of how that has developed—of the developing of a settlement, for example, in Las Vegas, Nevada, so that people could go down to San Bernardino, California. The people could come by ship into San Pedro, California, go to San Bernardino to be outfitted and helped with the equipment necessary to come into this valley, and then into the outlying communities, down into Sanpete County or up into Idaho or elsewhere.",2,

Although neither the Greek term nor its Hebrew equivalent, *nabi*, initially required the function of foretelling (Smith, p. 3), all prophecy looks to the future. Since the Lord has chosen some of his servants to be foretellers-to disclose, sometimes in specific terms, momentous events that are to occur-the predictive element often overshadows other implications of the word in the minds of some (see Revelation; Jesus Christ: Prophecies About Jesus Christ).

But the gift of prophecy is not restricted to those whose words have been recorded in scripture. By scriptural definition, a prophet is anyone who has a testimony of Jesus Christ and is moved by the Holy Ghost (Rev. 19:10; cf. *TPJS*, pp. 119, 160). Moses, voicing his approval of two men who had prophesied, exclaimed, ""Would God that all the Lord's people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them!"" (Num. 11:26-29). Schools of prophets and ""sons"" (followers) of prophets, some false and some true, existed in large numbers in Old Testament times. In modern times, speaking of Brigham Young, Elder Wilford Woodruff said, ""He is a prophet, I am a prophet, you are, and anybody is a prophet who has the testimony of Jesus Christ, for that is the spirit of prophecy"" (*JD* 13:165; see Spirit of Prophecy). It follows that this spirit does not operate in every utterance of its possessor. The Prophet Joseph Smith explained that ""a prophet [is] a prophet only when he [is] acting as such"" (*HC* 5:265).",1,Joseph

In contrast to the cultic concerns of the priests, the prophets stress the moral demands of deity and the ethical requirements of the covenant. The survival and success of the community depend more on the righteousness of the nation than on either the cultic activities of the priests or the military, political, social, and economic exploits of the king and his coterie. The battle against idolatry and apostasy was waged unremittingly through the whole biblical period, and the leaders in the struggle were the prophets. Second to that and equally difficult and important was the obligation to one's neighbor and to the community as a whole. On these two foundations, the prophetic message was constructed, and the prophets never ceased to propound the elementary and basic truths about biblical religion and the relationship of God to his people.",1,

Clearly, prophetic messages have not been designed to gain popular favor. A fundamental, common theme in all these messages is the call to repentance. Though prophets have counseled mercy, brotherhood, and humility, and though they have promised life and joy to those who have sought to love God and to receive his love, they have foreseen sorrow and despair as the unavoidable consequences of immorality, greed, idolatry, malice, pride, and other sins. They have yearned for peace, but they have condemned false prophets who have cried, ""Peace, peace; when there is no peace"" (Jer. 6:14). Unwarranted complacency, obsessive materialism, and the worship of other gods were main attributes of false prophets and their followers.",1,

Important truths are found in the counsel of the prophets to their own families, as in the words of Lehi and Alma 2 to their children (2 Ne. 1-4; Alma 36-42).

The same requirements and the same standards were upheld and applied even more sharply to an Israel prone to defection and default. With the appearance of the great world powers-Assyria in the eighth and seventh centuries B.C. and Babylonia toward the end of the seventh and on into the sixth-the question of the survival of the little kingdoms of Israel and Judah (and their neighbors) became acute. The prophets raise the issue sharply and in a new way for the first time since the time of the Patriarchs, with a larger perspective on the world scene and the role of Yahweh in ruling over the nations. The place of Israel and Judah in the larger picture is defined, and a theory of world order and time frame is foreshadowed. The implications of a single God ruling the universe but with special ties to one small nation (or two kingdoms) are developed. The danger and threats to the people of God are defined more sharply, but so also are the hopes and promises of the future. Ultimately, the God of the world, who is also the God of his particular way, and a restored and revealed Israel will take their place among the nations in a harmonious resolution of conflicts-to form the Peaceable Kingdom. The ultimate vision encompasses all nations and peoples, with a special place for Israel, still obligated by essential covenant stipulations, but a leader and model for all the others. Personal faith and morality are at the core of prophetic religion, but the implications and ramifications are social, national, and ultimately worldwide.",1,

Elder Bruce R. McConkie, an apostle, has written that a foreordained prophet has stood at the head of God's church in all dispensations of the gospel from the time of Adam (see Moses 5:9, 10) to the present, including, for example, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Peter, and Joseph Smith (*A New Witness for the Articles of Faith*, Salt Lake City, 1985, p. 2).

Prophets are always witnesses of Jesus Christ, a fact that is particularly evident in the Book of Mormon. The experience common to all its prophets is the witness they bore of Jesus Christ, the Messiah-of his divine sonship and his earthly mission. A number of them, including Lehi, Nephi 1, Jacob, Benjamin, Abinadi, Alma 2, and Samuel the Lamanite, foretold his coming (1 Ne. 1:19;10:4;19:7-8; Jacob 4:4-5; Mosiah 3:5-8). They foresaw his atoning sacrifice and his resurrection (Mosiah 3:10-11;15). Nephi wrote earlier of ancient prophets, Zenos, Neum, and Zenock (1 Ne. 19:10; 3 Ne. 10:14-16), who also foretold the visitation of Jesus Christ to the Americas after his resurrection (3 Ne. 11-26). Because Latter-day Saints identify Jesus Christ as Jehovah, they recognize that Old Testament prophets bore this same witness (see Jehovah, Jesus Christ).",3,

Three years later the angel-prophet-messenger Moroni 2, while instructing Joseph Smith, quoted from the prophets Malachi, Joel, and Isaiah, who told of the forthcoming mission of the Messiah and of the role of prophets, including Elijah, in the latter-day restoration of the gospel. Subsequent revelations given to Joseph Smith make frequent reference to the prophets of the Old and New Testaments. Most frequently cited, in addition to those mentioned above, are Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Peter, James, John, and John the Baptist. In April 1836, the prophets Moses, Elias, and Elijah appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and committed to them the keys of the priesthood (see D&C 110:11-16). Other angelic messengers, all prophets, had been instrumental in restoring the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods, beginning in 1829 (JS-H 1:68-73).

Joseph Smith had the spirit of prophecy after he and Oliver Cowdery were baptized in May 1829 (JS-H 1:73-74), and his prophetic office was officially recognized when the Church was organized on April 6, 1830. A revelation to him says, ""Thou shalt be called a seer, a translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of the church&#133;being inspired of the Holy Ghost to lay the foundation thereof"" (D&C 21:1-2). In March 1836, under the prophetic leadership of Joseph Smith, the membership of the Church sustained the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators (*HC* 2:417). Their successors have been similarly sustained.",1,

In its fully developed character, it sets biblical religion apart from other religions of the ancient Near East.

But often, and specifically in matters of religion, the people of the Bible formed and forged something distinctive and different from all that came before or continued side by side. And this is particularly true of biblical prophecy.

**THE CALL.** The divine call and commission mark the beginning of the prophet's career. In all recorded cases, the details are striking and distinctive; no two prophetic situations are exactly the same, although all share important elements. We have sufficient data for people like Moses, Samuel, Elisha (but not Elijah), and the great literary prophets such as Amos, Hosea, isaiah, jeremiah, and ezekiel to fill out a composite picture. But we lack information about the call of such prophets as Nathan and Ahijah. Typically, the call is initiated by God and is often accompanied by one or more visions, along with some unusual or miraculous occurrence (e.g., the burning bush). It is the combination of circumstances that persuades the prophet (or prophetess) that he (or she) is not hallucinating but is having contact with the living God.

**THE COMMISSION.** The call is always accompanied by a commission. The purpose is to enlist or draft the prophet to carry out a mission or duty-to do something in response to the call. Some prophets are reluctant to take on such responsibility, and therefore make excuses or otherwise try to evade their calling (e.g., Moses, Jeremiah, and, above all, Jonah). Other prophets are eager to carry out their task and hasten to do so (e.g., Isaiah, Ezekiel, perhaps Hosea). The basic rules for the prophet-the marching orders, as it were-are given succinctly and eloquently in the book of Jeremiah: ""Wherever I send you you shall go, and what I tell you, you shall say"" (Jer. 1:7[author translation]). In brief, the prophet is the ambassador or messenger of God, and his (or her) sole duty is to deliver the message as given.",3,

Though their teachings were all based in the gospel of Jesus Christ and they taught the same essential things, the record we have preserves some individual points of emphasis: Abinadi stressed living the Mosaic law with the proper spirit (Mosiah 12, 13); Nephi 1 and Alma 2 preached baptism and repentance (2 Ne. 31; Mosiah 18), as did Alma's sons (Alma 17-29). Many, including Nephi 1, Enos, Ether, and Moroni, were prompted to write and speak of faith and the gift of the Holy Ghost (e.g., 2 Ne. 26:13;32:2-3). In counsel to his son Jacob, Lehi taught the principles of ""opposition in all things"" and of agency (2 Ne. 2). King Benjamin urged his people to serve God by serving one another (Mosiah 2:17).

Prophets, beginning with Samuel, played a significant, if not decisive, part in establishing but also censuring the monarchy and remained an integral part of Israelite society as long as the monarchy survived, and even beyond, when there was still thought or hope of restoring the kingship of the house of David. While God generally speaks to prophets through visions, auditions, and even dreams, with Moses he spoke face to face (Deut. 34) or mouth to mouth (Ex. 33).

Their writings make up the Old Testament, one of the grandest collections of literature and revelation known to man.

But what about the New Testament period? Did God follow this same method then? Did he place prophets in the Christian church, thus preserving the historic pattern revealed in the Old Testament?

This he did!

Paul told the Ephesians that the church of Jesus Christ was built upon a foundation of apostles and prophets, with the Savior himself as the chief cornerstone. (See Eph. 2:20.)

Who were the prophets of that day?

The Twelve were included, of course. But were there others?

The New Testament tells us that there were. Silas and Barnabas were two of them, and both were great missionaries of that time.

Some, such as Moses, Amos, and Jeremiah, have even accepted the calling reluctantly. Some, including John the Baptist, Samuel, Nephi 1, and Joseph Smith, were called in childhood or youth.

The calls made to individual prophets and God's further communications with and through them have been accomplished in various ways: through the ministering of angels; in dreams; in day or night visions; by prophetic inspiration, an intense conviction verified by subsequent events; by the literal voice of God; and in face-to-face visitations such as those experienced by Moses (Ex. 33:11), Enoch (Moses 7:4), and Joseph Smith (JS-H 1:17). Sometimes the call has come with blinding intensity, as in those of Paul and Alma 2; sometimes, as with Elijah, the prophet has heard ""a still small voice"" (1 Kgs. 19:12). God has often spoken to his prophets in answer to prayer, but true prophets have not been mystics who try to make contact with the unseen by self-induced trances or similar means.

The calling of a prophet has always been made, and his messages have been written or spoken, through the power of the Holy Ghost, sometimes called the Spirit of the Lord (Acts 2:1-4, 37-42). Ananias put his hands on Paul that he might receive his sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost. ""And straightway he preached Christ&#133;that he is the Son of God"" (Acts 9:17-20). So, too, did the prophets before Paul, and so have all of them since. In close conjunction with the gift of the Holy Ghost is the priesthood power that has been exercised by God's representatives throughout all dispensations.

Miracles seem to be attached to unusual charismatic individuals who were also prophets but not necessarily to the role or office of prophet. In the case of Moses, they were designed to strengthen and confirm his claims to have received an authentic and authoritative message from God, and they served to augment the function and purpose of visions and similar experiences of other prophets.

**SUCCESS AND FAILURE.** On the whole, the results of the prophetic experience are themselves unpredictable, and success or failure on the part of individual prophets hardly affects their status as true prophets of God. Prophets such as Samuel and Elisha are reported to have met with much success in carrying out their missions. With Elijah and perhaps Isaiah, the results are mixed, as also with Amos, Hosea, and Micah. Ultimately, they were all recognized as true prophets, not because the leaders and the people heeded their words (often they did not), but because they faithfully reported what they heard from the mouth of God, regardless of consequences for themselves or the people to whom they delivered the message. The survival of the nation was seen to be at stake, and it was of the greatest importance to distinguish true from false prophets. This was no mere academic exercise, but required the best judgment of leaders and people alike.",2,

This is to say that while there is much we do not yet know, the truths and doctrine we have received have come and will continue to come by divine revelation. In some faith traditions, theologians claim equal teaching authority with the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and doctrinal matters may become a contest of opinions between them. Some rely on the ecumenical councils of the Middle Ages and their creeds. Others place primary emphasis on the reasoning of post-apostolic theologians or on biblical hermeneutics and exegesis. We value scholarship that enhances understanding, but in the Church today, just as anciently, establishing the doctrine of Christ or correcting doctrinal deviations is a matter of divine revelation to those the Lord endows with apostolic authority.2",3,

We believe that the same Church Jesus Christ established while on the earth has been restored once again by a prophet called of God in our time and that our leaders hold the same power and authority to act in God's name that ancient Apostles held. It is called the priesthood of God. We claim that through this restored authority, we can receive saving ordinances, such as baptism, and enjoy the purifying and refining gift of the Holy Ghost to be with us at all times. We have apostles and prophets leading and directing this Church through priesthood keys, and we believe that God speaks to His children through these prophets.

We also believe that this priesthood power makes it possible to make covenants and receive ordinances in holy temples that will someday enable us to return to the presence of God and live with Him forever. We also claim that, through this power, families can be bound together for eternity when couples enter the new and everlasting covenant of marriage in sacred buildings that we believe are literally the houses of God. We believe that we can receive these saving ordinances not only for ourselves but also for our ancestors who lived on the earth without having the chance to participate in these essential saving ordinances. We believe we can perform ordinances for our ancestors by proxy in these same holy temples.

(Matt. 28:19.)

The same gifts of the Spirit which prevailed in the church at the time of Jesus are prevalent today. Some of these gifts are: revelation, healing, miracles, prophecy, and many others—as found in First Corinthians, twelfth chapter; Doctrine and Covenants, forty-sixth section; and in the tenth chapter of Moroni in the Book of Mormon. Charity—the pure love of Christ—will be in evidence among its membership.

The same power which Jesus gave to His apostles that ""whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven"" (Matt. 18:18) will also be in the true church today. There are ordinances and blessings bestowed by an authorized ministry to Church members. These covenants and obligations, if entered into and obeyed, apply not just for this life, but for all eternity.

Every individual in the Lord's church is entitled to the sure knowledge, received by personal revelation through the Holy Ghost, that the Church is true. Personal revelation to the individual is the strength of the Church of Jesus Christ in any age.

We must learn the truth for a surety and not merely suppose we are right. It is our responsibility to know—and by the aid of the scriptures and the Holy Ghost one can know without any doubt.

One cannot prayerfully study the scriptures without gaining the knowledge and testimony that there is only one way to exaltation. The scriptures point the way very clearly. It must be God's way and not man's way, for God has said: ""For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord."" (Isa. 55:8.)",2,

Neither written scripture, nor natural theology, supersedes the ""living oracles"" (see Religious Experience; Revelation; Scripture).

**CHURCH.** Catholicism and Orthodoxy understand the Church as a ""communion of saints."" The Holy Spirit enlivens the Church with grace empowering it to carry on the work of Christ in history. It is a community of salvation where the Gospel is preached and the sacraments received. Latter-day Saints believe that with the restoration of the higher priesthood came three elements lost from the New Testament Church: (1) organizational patterns and their related offices, including a quorum of twelve apostles; (2) the spirit of prophecy, and all the spiritual gifts; and (3) the temple with its essential ordinances and practices (see Gifts of the Spirit; Organization; Temples). Catholics affirm that grace centers in God's free gift offered through Christ in the sacraments and is infused to the soul. Baptism is essential for salvation. All sacraments are the necessary means of the grace needed for salvation. Mormon rites or ordinances are processes of spiritual rebirth in which the powers of godliness are manifest. They are received by all and all the ordinances are essential to salvation, from baptism to the higher ordinances of the temple. Their efficacy requires proper forms, ordained priesthood authority, and the faith and repentance of the person. There are degrees of salvation and the fulness of salvation or exaltation requires the fulness of the ordinances (see Baptism; Confirmation; Endowment; Temple Ordinances).",3,

Therefore, the question in this case is likely not what his motivation was. It should be whether or not you believe him when you hear his motivation.

As I said above, this is a question I took directly to Heavenly Father. I put aside my personal assumptions and I asked Him if it was a commandment from Him, and if it was, to open my mind and give me understanding and insight as to *why* it was a commandment. Because I did that, I can say that yes, I believe Joseph when I hear what his motivation was, according to those who knew him and the revelation he received.

The idea that he did it for reasons of lust isn't borne out by the evidence. There isn't any evidence of sexual relations in most of his unions, and the ones that do have evidence show that it happened rarely.",3,

Some scholars have noted that the keys of Peter (Matt. 16:19) can only be the keys of the temple, and many studies have demonstrated the identity of tomb, temple, and palace as the place where the powers of the other world are exercised for the eternal benefit of the human race (cf. *CWHN* 4:361). The gates of hell do not prevail against the one who holds these keys, however much the church on earth may suffer.

Others press for a preparatory orientation so that those who enter the temple will not be confused. I want to emphasize that *the preparation to enter the temple lies in the gospel.* Nothing is said or done in the temple which does not have its foundation in the scriptures.

The gospel is *faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ.* This implies a willingness to accept His doctrine and take upon us His name, being obedient to His commandments. *The gospel is repentance* and a cleansing from all iniquity. *It is baptism* whereby we have made the covenant and promise. It is the right to have the *companionship of the Holy Ghost,* which, when we have a correct frame of mind, will teach us as we go through the temple. *The gospel is the scriptures.* The answer to almost any appropriate question about the temple will be found in the scriptures for those who seek it. *The gospel is prayer, humility, teachableness, charity.* It is *commitment* and it is *covenant* and *ordinances.* It is also *blessings.*",2,

The first known mention of the Latin word *templum* is by Varro (116-27 B.C.), for whom it designated a building specially designed for interpreting signs in the heavens-a sort of observatory where one gets one's bearings on the universe. The root *tem-* in Greek and Latin denotes a ""cutting,"" or intersection of two lines at right angles and hence the place where the four regions of the world come together, ancient temples being carefully oriented to express ""the idea of pre-established harmony between a celestial and a terrestrial image"" (Jeremias, cited in *CWHN* 4:358). According to Varro, there are three temples: one in heaven, one on earth, and one beneath the earth (*De Lingua Latina* 7.8). In the universal temple concept, these three are identical, one being built exactly over the other, with the earth temple in the middle of everything, representing ""the Pole of the heavens, around which all heavenly motions revolve, the knot that ties earth and heaven together, the seat of universal dominion"" (Jeremias, cited in *CWHN* 4:358).

For example, it is sometimes said:

1. My genealogy has all been done.
2. Computers and the name extraction will do the work for me.
3. Temple work is for the dead.
4. Temple work is for old people.
5. We go to the temple to do a name.
6. Going to the temple is optional.

As we study the scriptures, we learn that the doctrine of the temple requires the following of the Latter-day Saints:

First, the building of temples.

Second, going to the temple for our blessings.

Third, returning to perform the ordinances for deceased relatives.

Fourth, doing the work for others as well.

Fifth, frequent attendance for personal spiritual benefit.

What are all these temples for?

First: *Temples are for the living members of the Church.* Going to the temple is *not* optional. Temples are ""a place of instruction for all those who are called to the work of the ministry … that they may be perfected in [their] understanding … in all things pertaining to the kingdom of God on the earth."" (D&C 97:13–14.) ""Therefore, verily I say unto you, that your anointings, and your washings, … your solemn assemblies, … and … your oracles in your most holy places … [are] for the glory, honor, and endowment of [Zion's] municipals [or in other words, her citizens, and] are ordained by the ordinance of my holy house, which my people are always commanded to build unto my holy name.""

The early Christian fathers claimed that pagan counterparts had been stolen from older legitimate sources, and virtually every major mythology tells of a great usurper who rules the world.

Comparative studies have discovered a common pattern in all ancient religions and have traced processes of diffusion that spread ideas throughout the world. The task of reconstructing the original prototype from the scattered fragments has been a long and laborious one, and it is far from complete, but an unmistakable pattern emerges (*CWHN* 4:367).

Reconstructions of great gatherings of people at imposing ceremonial complexes for rites dedicated to the renewal of life on earth are surprisingly uniform. First, there is tangible evidence, the scenery and properties of the drama: megaliths; artificial giant mounds or pyramids amounting to artificial mountains; stone and ditch alignments of mathematical sophistication correlating time and space; passage graves and great *tholoi*, or domed tombs; sacred roads; remains of booths, grandstands, processional ways, and gates-these still survive in awesome combination, with all their cosmic symbolism.

Second is the less tangible evidence of customs, legends, folk festivals, and ancient writings, which together conjure up memories of dramatic and choral celebrations of the Creation, culminating in the great Creation Hymn; ritual contests between life and death, good and evil, and light and darkness, followed by the triumphant coronation of the king to rule for the new age, the progenitor of the race by a sacred marriage; covenants; initiations (including washing and clothing); sacrifices and scapegoats to rid the people of a year of guilt and pollution; and various types of divination and oracular consultation for the new life cycle.",0,

The words ""hotel,"" ""hospital,"" and ""Templar"" go back to those charitable organizations that took care of sick and weary pilgrims traveling to the holy places. Banking functions arose at the temple, since pilgrims brought offerings and needed to exchange their money for animals to be sacrificed, and thus the word ""money"" comes from the temple of Juno Moneta, the holy center of the Roman world. Along with that, lively barter and exchange of goods at the great year rites led to the yearly fair, when all contracts had to be renewed and where merchants, artisans, performers, and mountebanks displayed their wares.

Actors, poets, singers, dancers, and athletes were also part of temple life, the competitive element (the *agonal* ) being essential to the struggle with evil and providing the most popular and exciting aspects of the festivals. The temple's main drama, the *actio*, was played by priestly temple actors and royalty. Creation was celebrated with a creation hymn, or *poema* -the word ""poem"" meaning ""creation""-sung by a chorus that, as the Greek word shows, formed a circle and danced as they sang (*CWHN* 4:380).",1,

It was the *Museon*, or home of the Muses, representing every branch of study: astronomy, mathematics, architecture, and fine arts. People would travel from shrine to shrine exchanging wisdom with the wise, as Abraham did in Egypt. Since the Garden of Eden, or ""golden age"" motif, was essential to this ritual paradise, temple grounds contained trees and animals, often collected from distant places. Central to the temple school was the library, containing sacred records, including the ""Books of Life,"" the names of all the living and the dead, as well as liturgical and scientific works.

The temple rites acknowledged the rule of God on earth through his agent and offspring, the king, who represented both the first man and every man as he sat in judgment, making the temple the ultimate seat and sanction of law and government. People met at the holy place for contracts and covenants and to settle disputes.

**THE TEMPLE AND CIVILIZATION.** All this indicates that the temple is the source, and not a derivative, of the civilizing process. If there is no temple, there is no true Israel; and where there is no true temple, civilization itself is but an empty shell-a material structure of expediency and tradition alone, bereft of the living organism at its center that once gave it life and made it flourish.

Many secular institutions today occupy structures faithfully copied from ancient temples. The temple economy has been perverted along with the rest: feasts of joy and abundance became orgies; sacred rites of marriage were perverted; teachers of wisdom became haughty and self-righteous, demonstrating that anything can be corrupted in this world, and as Aristotle notes, the better the original, the more vicious the corrupted version.",1,

Only in dedicated temples can certain sacred ordinances be performed, certain covenants between man and God be made, and the promise of certain blessings be conveyed. Through them a person may more fully comprehend the purpose of earth life, the ultimate destinies of mankind, and the importance of developing Christlike attributes here in mortality.

**ENTERING THE TEMPLE.** All who enter the temple must come as worthy members duly certified by ecclesiastical leaders-the bishop and the stake president. The individual's temple recommend or certification to enter the temple is presented upon arrival to the recommend desk attendant. The signatures are verified and the expiration date is checked. A recommend is issued annually and is valid for one year.

Everyone in the temple, temple workers and patrons alike, is dressed in white clothing and is free of worldly ornamentation. All are encouraged to speak with soft voices and guard against extraneous thoughts and conversations, which detract from the spiritual tone of the sanctuary.

The temple is not used for Sunday worship but is rather a sacred edifice where ordinances may be performed and covenants may be made in quiet dignity, away from the cares and din of the outside world. The temple is closed on Sunday, the day in which members worship and learn in their ward meetinghouses.

1. The Restoration is a process, not an event, and will continue until the Lord comes again.
2. The ultimate objective of the gathering of Israel15 is to bring the blessings of the temple to God's faithful children.
3. As we seek how to accomplish *that* objective more effectively, the Lord reveals more insights. The ongoing Restoration needs ongoing revelation.

The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have often asked the Lord if there are better ways to take the blessings of the temple to His faithful children. We seek guidance regularly on how to ensure worldwide accuracy and consistency of temple instruction, covenants, and ordinances despite differences in language and culture.

Under the Lord's direction and in answer to our prayers, recent procedural adjustments have been made. *He* is the One who wants you to understand with great clarity exactly what you are making covenants to do. *He* is the One who wants you to experience fully *His* sacred ordinances. *He* wants you to comprehend your privileges, promises, and responsibilities. *He* wants you to have spiritual insights and awakenings you've never had before. This He desires for *all* temple patrons, no matter where they live.

Current adjustments in temple procedures, and others that will follow, are continuing evidence that the Lord is actively directing His Church. He is providing opportunities for each of us to bolster our spiritual foundations more effectively by centering our lives on Him and on the ordinances and covenants of His temple. When you bring your temple recommend, a contrite heart, and a seeking mind to the Lord's house of learning, *He* will teach you.",1,

First, they symbolically and literally remind us and teach us about Christ and His Father. We know that Christ spent key parts of His ministry at the temple in Jerusalem (see John 7–8; Matt. 21–23; Mark 11–12; Luke 20), and drew frequently on temple symbolism in His teachings, often comparing Himself to symbols used in the temple, such as light and water (see, for example, John 7:38; John 8:12). Our temple worship today includes many symbolic references to Christ, from the spires on the outside that point our minds heavenward, to the white clothing we wear inside the temple to symbolize that, as the book of Revelation says, we have come ""out of great tribulation, and have washed [our] robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb"" (Rev. 7:14).

Temples stand as a constant physical reminder of the grace and the goodness of the Father. This helps communities of Saints strengthen themselves. President George Q. Cannon said: ""Every foundation stone that is laid for a temple, and every temple completed … lessens the power of Satan on the earth, and increases the power of God and Godliness"" (Logan Temple cornerstone ceremony, 19 Sept. 1877; quoted in Nolan Porter Olsen, *Logan Temple: The First 100 Years* , 34).",2,

Even among themselves, Latter-day Saints do not talk about the details of the temple ceremony outside the Temple, because they are sacred. In the temple, worshipers go through several steps that symbolize withdrawal from the world and entrance into the abode of deity. They present their temple recommend to enter, change from street clothes to all-white clothing, and communicate only in quiet voices while in the holy building. Temples are not open on Sunday, because the Sabbath day is dedicated to worshiping the Lord in homes and in Church gatherings at meetinghouses.

For those who enter the house of the Lord with ""clean hands, and a pure heart"" (Ps. 24:4), with a ""broken heart and a contrite spirit"" (3 Ne. 9:20; cf. Ps. 51:17), and with no ill feelings toward others (Matt. 5:23-24), the temple is an ideal place to worship through meditation, renewal, prayer, and quiet service. The Lord described his house as ""a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God"" (D&C 88:119). The reverence in the temple is hospitable to the spirit of humble worship and holiness. In the stillness of the Lord's house, those who yearn to hear the word of the Father and to be heard by him pray silently or join in solemn supplications on behalf of the sick and afflicted and those seeking inspiration and guidance (cf. 1 Kgs. 8:30-49; *see also* Prayer Circle).",3,

They serve with commendable devotion to find the names of deceased relatives, to work in extracting names from the records, and then to perform the ordinances for the redemption of the dead as well as for themselves. Over sixteen thousand temple workers give voluntary service in the temples, thus approaching in numbers the force of full-time missionaries who are proclaiming the gospel.",3,

However, all Church leaders are encouraged to focus principally on people, to feed the sheep in the Lord's flock, to know and love the members, to listen, love, and help with personal needs. ""It is the leader's duty&#133;to teach the member to love-not the leader or teacher, but the truth of the gospel"" (D. McKay, *IE* 71 [Dec. 1968]:108). To do this, leaders are frequently counseled to seek the spiritual gifts of discernment and wisdom (cf. Luke 12:12; D&C 84:85).

In addition to inspiration, leaders may look to others for training or assistance. A leader may confer with his or her own priesthood leader about a problem or need, especially in one's ""stewardship review""-a one-on-one session with one's organizational leader. These personal interviews are customarily held four times a year, ""for it is required of the Lord, at the hand of every steward, to render an account of his stewardship, both in time and in eternity"" (D&C 72:3).

When I think of what our people do in this Church without having to be paid with money for what they do, I know that it is a tremendous thing. You take the General Authorities here on the stand. When they were called to be General Authorities, there was nothing said to them about whether they would receive an allowance to live on. I remember when I was back in Washington, just after President Benson was called to be a member of the Twelve and he had not yet been out West to be ordained and set apart. I was then the Presiding Bishop and attended his stake conference. And he said: ""Bishop, will there be any provision that we will have a living while we are serving as General Authorities of the Church?"" And I said: ""Well, there will be a little allowance. But,"" I said, ""you will have to live differently than you have done back here unless you have got a little bit tucked away!"" I happen to know of an offer that was made to him while he was in the Department of Agriculture that, in those days, was a tremendous offer; and he passed that by to come back here to be a member of the Quorum without any assurance that he would have an allowance given to him.

I think of when President Tanner was called to be one of the General Authorities. President McKay told us that he was in line to become the prime minister of Canada and that he was at the head of several great industrial organizations in Canada. I am sure that if he were to stand here now, he would tell you that when President McKay asked him to be one of the General Authorities, he did not discuss with him anything about an allowance that he would receive.",1,

From the Book of Mormon we read of the young prophet Nephi who also beheld a vision on a mountain. (See 1 Ne. 11:1.) Once he had envisioned the promised land, he could not be dissuaded from building a ship that would take him there. (See 1 Ne. 17–18.)

Some years ago I was traveling in the Rosario Argentina Mission up in the northern part of Argentina. As we were traveling along the road, we passed a large herd of cattle being moved. The herd was moving peaceably and without difficulty. The herd was quiet. There were no dogs. Out in front leading the herd were three gauchos on horseback, each about fifteen or twenty yards apart. These three horsemen were slumped forward in their saddles, completely relaxed, confident that the herd would follow them. At the rear of the herd was a single rider bringing up the rear. He, too, was slumped forward in his saddle as if he were sleeping. The whole herd moved peacefully, quietly, and was subdued.

While the role of administrator is a necessary one, it is not the most vital aspect of leadership, which is to minister.

The characteristics of effective spiritual leadership are those that enable individuals to minister to their brothers and sisters in the gospel, including a willingness to seek and follow the counsel of the Lord as manifested through the Holy Ghost, on one's own behalf and on behalf of those in need of direction. In addition, leaders are to understand the nature of their stewardships and seek to fulfill their responsibilities in meekness and humility. Good leaders understand their roles as servants to others (Matt. 20:27).

First, and very important, members are given early and repeated opportunities to serve, thereby learning from experience. Beginning at age twelve, young men and women can serve as teachers for children or as members of class presidencies or of youth activities committees. In addition, teacher development courses and in-service lessons assist teachers, and leadership training meetings instruct leaders of various organizations. Manuals and handbooks outline the responsibilities of individuals serving in different organizations at both ward and stake levels.

Lay participation and leadership have several implications for the Church and its members. Part of the mission of the Church is to perfect the Saints (Eph. 4:12), to sponsor growth in individual members. Utilizing volunteer members at all levels of the organization may not ensure peak efficiency, but it does provide the experiences and interactions that will help members progress. Volunteer staffing also means that in most of the callings members work part-time and that this service is in addition to regular employment and other responsibilities. This provides the opportunity for learning to sacrifice and to balance commitments. In general, members who serve maintain a high level of commitment to the Church, in part because of their awareness that they are responsible for making a contribution and because they take satisfaction from doing so. Because professional training is not required, lay leadership lessens the sense of hierarchy and increases feelings of unity. The children's music leader may have more formal education than the bishop. After being released in a few years, that bishop may serve as children's music leader. Opportunities to serve in a variety of callings and to be served by people in different capacities can increase the sense of brotherhood and sisterhood shared by Church members.",0,

Aren't we something less than a friend if we have a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ and are unwilling to share it?

A friend is a possession we earn, not a gift. ""Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you."" (John 15:14.) The Lord has declared that those who serve him and keep his commandments are called his servants. After they have been tested and tried and are found faithful and true in all things, they are called no longer servants, but friends. His friends are the ones he will take into his kingdom and with whom he will associate in an eternal inheritance. (See D&C 93:45–46.)

Let me share with you quickly a few of the many ""friend"" references in the Doctrine and Covenants referred to by our Savior:

""And again, verily I say unto you, my friends … —

""Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

""Whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name it shall be given unto you, that is expedient for you."" (D&C 88:62–64.)

""… my friends Sidney and Joseph. …"" (D&C 100:1.)

""… my friends, behold, I will give unto you a revelation and commandment. …"" (D&C 103:1.)

""… my friends, fear not. …"" (D&C 98:1.)

You'll see that Joseph, Jesus's stepfather is not mentioned anywhere in the story after the event at the temple at age twelve. So that was eighteen years before this point over in the book the gospel of Luke that we got that story. And so somewhere in those eighteen years, the assumption is that Joseph has passed away and leaving Mary a widow and under Jewish law, that leaves Jesus as the firstborn son in that family, the birthright son, that leaves him in charge of taking care of Mary and the family. So culturally speaking, that's kind of an important point that it tells you Mary is there and she seems to have some sort of authority over the servants. She's not your typical wedding guest to be able to go and tell the servants to do certain things and have them obey. So some have wondered, is this perhaps the wedding of one of Jesus's half sisters or perhaps a
brother? Usually a wedding feast would take place at the home of the groom so maybe more likely for a half sister but at the end of the day we don't know. It could be other close relatives of Mary but she is there and Jesus, it says in verse 2, ""Both Jesus was called, and his disciples to the marriage."" So it's a close enough relation, whoever's getting married, that Jesus and his disciples are called as well to the wedding.",1,

A priest-age young man was asked the same question. ""My bishop."" ""Why?"" ""Because he listens to us guys.""

From these cannot we conclude that friendship is earned?

It was Emerson who said, ""The only way to have a friend is to be one."" No one can be a friend until he is known. A friend is a person who will really take the time not only to know us, but to be with us. One of the finest presents you can give anyone is your best self.",0,

""Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.

""Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.

""So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.""11

The custom in those days was for the host of a wedding feast—in this parable, the king—to provide garments for the wedding guests. Such wedding garments were simple, nondescript robes that all attendees wore. In this way, rank and station were eliminated, and everyone at the feast could mingle as equals.12

People invited from the highways to attend the wedding would not have had the time or means to procure appropriate attire in preparation for the event. Consequently, the king likely gave guests the garments from his own wardrobe. Everyone was given the opportunity to clothe themselves in garments of royalty.13

As the king entered the wedding hall, he surveyed the audience and immediately noticed that one conspicuous guest was not wearing a wedding garment. The man was brought forward, and the king asked, ""Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.""14 In essence, the king asked, ""Why are you not wearing a wedding garment, even though one was provided for you?""15

The man obviously was not dressed properly for this special occasion, and the phrase ""And he was speechless"" indicates that the man was without excuse.16",0,

Through these parables, Jesus further offers a stark contrast between how God will answer our prayers and how flawed mortals—similar to people we may meet in our own lives—grant requests. In both parables, the friend and the judge act mostly out of self-interest in hopes that the petitioner will stop bothering them at inconvenient times. Contrasted to these individuals who knew ""how to give good gifts"" even with less than perfect motives is the love and mercy of our Heavenly Father as He will respond to our sincere and earnest petitions: ""How much more shall your heavenly Father give good gifts through the Holy Spirit to them who ask him?""

There was a man, lame from birth, lying there. A beggar all through his life, he had never walked on his feet. As they moved in his direction he held out his hands, beckoning, expecting alms. Peter said to him, as we will all recall:

""Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.

""And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up. …"" (Acts 3:6–7.)

Peter was a friend. He told the beggar, ""Rise and walk; I'm going to help you."" We too must take the friend by the hand until he sees and finds that he has enough strength to go on his own. Is it not appropriate to conclude that Peter was willing to take the friend the way he was but left him improved? Our Savior pointed the way to reap friendship with our associates and with him when he declared:

""For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:

""… Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."" (Matt. 25:35, 40.)

One thing the play happens to get right, however, is that the Book of Mormon has something important to say about music and performance.

As Latter-day Saints gather and sing hymns of praise to the name of the Lord, they experience greater spiritual unity with one another and with the Lord. In modern revelation, the Lord Himself has declared His love of righteous music: ""For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.""

The Bible likewise condemns music used for wicked purposes (Psalm 69:13; Job 21:11–12).14 Recognizing the scriptural attitude toward music can help readers today to make wise media choices.

Ancient poetic lines didn't necessarily rhyme or follow a strict meter like the poetry that most modern readers are familiar with. Instead, the poetry we find in the Bible and Book of Mormon used what is called parallelism to create beautiful literary pairings.10. For more information on parallelisms in the Book of Mormon, see Book of Mormon Central, ""Why Is the Presence of Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon Significant? (Mosiah 5:10–12),"" KnoWhy 166 (August 16, 2016); Carl J. Cranney, ""The Deliberate Use of Hebrew Parallelisms in the Book of Mormon,"" Journal of Book of Mormon Studies 23 (2014): 140–165."")

For example, 2 Nephi 4 is often referred to as ""Nephi's Psalm"" and is indeed a piece of Book of Mormon poetry or hymnody:

> 28 Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.
>
> 29 Do not anger again because of mine enemies. Do not slacken my strength because of mine afflictions.

The people in the Book of Mormon sang praises to God after victorious battles, they sang during celebrations, and they sang during worship services.2,"" KnoWhy 251 (December 13, 2016)."") During the years of righteousness during the Nephite golden age, ""their meetings were conducted by the church after the manner of the workings of the Spirit, and by the power of the Holy Ghost; for as the power of the Holy Ghost led them whether to preach, or to exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate, *or to sing*, even so it was done"" (Moroni 6:9, emphasis added).

Twenty of the Book of Mormon's twenty-four references to singing deal specifically with singing praises unto the Lord.3 Its peoples sang to praise the Lord's victory after battle (3 Nephi 4:31–33); they sang to praise His power and atoning grace (Alma 5:9, 26); and they sang to emulate the angels in heaven. Lehi (1 Nephi 1:8) and Alma the younger (Alma 36:22) both saw visions of the heavenly choirs singing praises to God. King Benjamin (Mosiah 2:28) and Mormon (Mormon 7:7) both expressed a longing to one day join these angelic choirs above.",2,

Possibly the most important take away is that the Book of Mormon's music repeatedly praises the Lord for His power to deliver His people from physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual dangers. Music and song can even act as a metaphor for Christ's Atonement. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland declared that the ""most precious anthem of all [is] 'the song of redeeming love.'""15

> ""Fortunately, the seats for this particular number are limitless. […] In short, there is a place for everyone who loves God and honors His commandments as the inviolable measuring rod for personal behavior, for if love of God is the melody of our shared song, surely our common quest to obey Him is the indispensable harmony in it.""16

Regardless of anyone's musical ability, the Book of Mormon teaches that the most important song to sing is the song of Christ's redeeming love. If people embrace the Savior's Atonement and live their days singing the song of His redeeming love, the day will come when their souls—like the ""immortal spirit"" of King Benjamin—""may join the choirs above in singing the praises of a just God"" (Mosiah 2:28).

Failing to recognize these musical elements and spiritual themes leaves any performance of the Book of Mormon incomplete and inadequate, whether public or private, whether in the narrow gate or on the broad way.

I learned that just as rockets must overcome the pull of gravity to roar into space, so we must overcome the pull of the world to soar into the eternal realms of understanding and love. I realized my mortal life might end there, but there was no panic. I knew life would continue, and whether here or there didn't really matter. What did matter was how much love I had in my heart. I knew I needed more! I knew that our joy now and forever is inextricably tied to our capacity to love.

As these thoughts filled and lifted my soul, I gradually became aware of some excited voices. My companion Feki's eyes were dancing as he said, ""Kolipoki, a boat has arrived, and it is full of food. We are saved! Aren't you excited?"" I wasn't sure, but since the boat had come, that must be God's answer, so yes, I was happy. Feki gave me some food and said, ""Here, eat."" I hesitated.

""Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you.

""But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.

""And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good—to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted."" (Jacob 2:17–19.)

In our own dispensation, when the Church was only nine months old, the Lord said:

""And for your salvation I give unto you a commandment, for I have heard your prayers, and the poor have complained before me, and the rich have I made, and all flesh is mine, and I am no respecter of persons."" (D&C 38:16.)

This revelation was given on the second day of January 1831. The next month, in another revelation, the Lord said:

""If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my commandments.

""And behold, thou wilt remember the poor, and consecrate of thy properties for their support."" (D&C 42:29–30.)

The same month, the Lord referred to this subject again. Evidently the Brethren had been a little remiss. They had not moved fast enough.

""Behold, I say unto you, that ye must visit the poor and the needy and administer to their relief."" (D&C 44:6.)

The scriptures are full of commandments regarding our obligation to care for the poor; therefore, I will not elaborate further. It has always seemed somewhat paradoxical to me that we must constantly have the Lord *command* us to do those things which are for our own good. The Lord has said,

""He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."" (Matt. 10:39.)",0,

The means of salvation through the gospel of Jesus Christ is the same for all of God's creations. Creation is continual and expansive and is directed toward the eternal happiness of all intelligent beings, for the Lord told Moses, ""As one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is no end to my works, neither to my words"" (Moses 1:38). For Latter-day Saints the gospel of Jesus Christ has universal validity, in both time and space. God's Plan of Salvation operates on a universal scale. Latter-day Saints believe that there are now countless planets whose inhabitants-children of God-are progressing, as are human beings on this earth, according to eternal principles towards a Godlike life.

God's plan is a plan of simplicity. It involves being obedient to simple laws, laws that have within them an automatic blessing and happiness for obedience and an automatic punishment and unhappiness for their disobedience.

I urge you to clear away the clutter. Take your life back. Use your willpower. Learn to say no to those things that will rob you of your precious time and infringe upon your agency to choose to live in exactness to God's plan of happiness and exaltation.

Don't let the subtle influences of Satan take away any part of your life. Keep it under your own control and operated by your own agency. This life is a probationary period. It is a marvelous gift of time during which we can learn to be like our Heavenly Father by following the teachings of His Son, Jesus Christ. The path He leads us on is not a cluttered path. It is simple and straight and lighted by the Spirit.

It is my humble prayer that by our choices we may preserve our individual agency from the subtleness of Satan and live our lives bright and clear and on the path that leads us back to the presence of our Holy Father.

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",1,

""Astronomy has always held a fascination for me, but my mathematical abilities are awaiting the Millennium for development,"" he says. (Norman's degree is in early Christian studies, not any hard sciences.) Later, he admits he only has ""a superficial knowledge of what has been going on in theoretical physics in this [the 20th] century. I can presume to offer no more than that, as I am still struggling with books on the subject written for the layman.""

What's telling is that the focus of the article is on how Latter-day Saint theology is Newtonian, but he never cites the Book of Abraham as the source for his theory, and he certainly offers no evidence that the Book of Abraham teaches a Newtonian view of the universe. He cites the B of A only once. Here's the reference in its entirety:

The astronomical assertions in the Pearl of Great Price may indicate that God rules within our own galaxy, the Milky Way: ""Kolob is set nigh unto the throne of God, to govern all those planets which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest"" (Abr. 3:9; cf. facsimile 2, esp. fig. 5). Does each God have his and her own galaxy or cluster of galaxies?

Suppose you have a midterm test coming up in geometry in two weeks. One of your goals is to get an A in geometry. How do you go about reaching that goal? Do you wait until the last minute and cram the night before the test? This technique is filled with risk. Instead of truly understanding the material, the attempt is to learn enough that somehow you can make it through the test successfully. Unfortunately, instead of being totally prepared and confident about the subject, you walk into the classroom a little bit nervous, with a lot of hope that the teacher will ask you the questions which you happen to know. I have a feeling I'm not the only one here today who has experienced this uneasy feeling.

Now let's take another student who, with the same goal of attaining an A in geometry, realizes that he doesn't want to count on the intangibles of luck and hope. So, instead of cramming, he or she sets aside a little time every day to calmly and in depth study the subject. This gives the necessary time to digest and properly understand the material. If confusion arises on any given topic, there's plenty of time to ask the teacher for help. What's the result from this second technique? A deeper understanding of the material? Increased self-confidence going into the test? Less reliance on hope? I think so.

Is it actually possible to go into the classroom knowing beforehand that you will get an A on the test because of your preparation? I know it is. I've seen it done.

Therefore, if you want to get an A in the classroom, continual daily dedication is the answer. If you want to get an A in your celestial goals, the same daily technique needs to be applied.",0,

Priesthood authority functions in both the family and the Church. The priesthood is the power of God used to bless all of His children, male and female. Some of our abbreviated expressions, like ""the women and the priesthood,"" convey an erroneous idea. Men are not ""the priesthood."" Priesthood meeting is a meeting of those who hold and exercise the priesthood. The blessings of the priesthood, such as baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, the temple endowment, and eternal marriage, are available to men and women alike. The authority of the priesthood functions in the family and in the Church, according to the principles the Lord has established.

When my father died, my mother presided over our family. She had no priesthood office, but as the surviving parent in her marriage she had become the governing officer in her family. At the same time, she was always totally respectful of the priesthood authority of our bishop and other Church leaders. She presided over her family, but they presided over the Church.",2,Sixtus

Without priesthood authority, no ordinances-no matter how, when, where, or by whom performed-are valid, ratified by the Holy Ghost, or recorded in heaven (D&C 132:7). The sealing power, the power to bind on earth and in heaven (Matt. 16:19;18:18; D&C 132:46), belongs solely to the priesthood of God; and proper baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, the holy Endowment, eternal marriage, and family sealings come only through the authorized servants of the Lord. Through these powers and authorities of the holy priesthood, the work of salvation proceeds as it was planned in the grand councils of heaven before the world was.",2,

In an address to the Relief Society, President Joseph Fielding Smith, then President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, said this: ""While the sisters have not been given the Priesthood, it has not been conferred upon them, that does not mean that the Lord has not given unto them authority. … A person may have authority given to him, or a sister to her, to do certain things in the Church that are binding and absolutely necessary for our salvation, such as the work that our sisters do in the House of the Lord. They have authority given unto them to do some great and wonderful things, sacred unto the Lord, and binding just as thoroughly as are the blessings that are given by the men who hold the Priesthood.""7

In that notable address, President Smith said again and again that women have been given authority. To the women he said, ""You can speak with authority, because the Lord has placed authority upon you."" He also said that the Relief Society ""[has] been given power and authority to do a great many things. The work which they do is done by divine authority."" And, of course, the Church work done by women or men, whether in the temple or in the wards or branches, is done under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys. Thus, speaking of the Relief Society, President Smith explained, ""[The Lord] has given to them this great organization where they have authority to serve under the directions of the bishops of the wards … , looking after the interest of our people both spiritually and temporally.""8

Thus, it is truly said that Relief Society is not just a class for women but something they belong to—a divinely established appendage to the priesthood.9",3,

However, that compassionate nature can become overwhelming for women who identify far more to accomplish than they can possibly do, even with the help of the Lord. Some become discouraged because they do not feel they are doing all they should do. I believe this is a feeling that many worthy, effective, devoted women of the Church experience.

Therefore, as a husband or son, express gratitude for what your wife and mother do for you. Express your love and gratitude often. That will make life far richer, more pleasant and purposeful for many of the daughters of Father in Heaven who seldom hear a complimentary comment and are not thanked for the multitude of things they do. As a husband, when you sense that your wife needs lifting, hold her in your arms and tell her how much you love her. May each of us ever be tender and appreciative of the special women who enrich our lives.

Often the real value of something is not recognized until it is taken from us. To illustrate, consider a man who had lost the use of the priesthood through transgression. Later it was returned to him as part of the restoration of ordinances he obtained through full repentance. After the restoration, I turned to his wife and said, ""Would you like a blessing?"" She enthusiastically responded. Then I looked at the husband, now capable of using his priesthood, and said, ""Would you like to give your wife a blessing?"" Words cannot express the profound emotion of such an experience and the bonds of love, trust, and gratitude it created. You shouldn't have to lose your priesthood to appreciate it more fully.

In some cultures, tradition places a man in a role to dominate, control, and regulate all family affairs. That is not the way of the Lord. In some places the wife is almost owned by her husband, as if she were another of his personal possessions. That is a cruel, unproductive, mistaken vision of marriage encouraged by Lucifer that every priesthood holder must reject. It is founded on the false premise that a man is somehow superior to a woman. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The scriptures confirm that Father in Heaven saved His greatest, most splendid, supreme creation, woman, to the end. Only after all else was completed was woman created. Only then was the work pronounced complete and good.

Have you ever wondered why there are so many Christian churches in the world today when they obtain their doctrines from essentially the same Bible? It is because they interpret the Bible differently. If they interpreted it the same, they would be the same church. This is not a condition the Lord desires, for the Apostle Paul declared that there is ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism"" (Ephesians 4:5). To help bring this oneness about, the Lord established a divine law of witnesses. Paul taught, ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Corinthians 13:1).

The Bible is one witness of Jesus Christ; the Book of Mormon is another. Why is this second witness so crucial? The following illustration may help: How many straight lines can you draw through a single point on a piece of paper? The answer is infinite. For a moment, suppose that single point represents the Bible and that hundreds of those straight lines drawn through that point represent different interpretations of the Bible and that each of those interpretations represents a different church.

What happens, however, if on that piece of paper there is a second point representing the Book of Mormon?

Our families may be corrupted by worldly trends and teachings unless we know how to use the book to expose and combat the falsehoods in socialism, organic evolution, rationalism, humanism, etc. Our missionaries are not as effective unless they are ""hissing forth"" with it.

As a result, their minds had been darkened. The Lord said that this kind of treatment of the Book of Mormon brought the whole Church under condemnation, even all of the children of Zion.

They quoted and adapted their sources for their own needs, and they were deeply influenced by their cultural setting and environment. Unfortunately, when this discussion arises with respect to the text of the Book of Mormon, the JST, and the Book of Abraham, the conversation partners often draw stark boundary lines of orthodoxy and heresy between those who seem to claim that all of Joseph Smith's scriptural projects were completed without the influence of external sources and those who find Joseph's scriptural projects as simply derivative from his cultural inheritance.

Joseph and Hyrum, meanwhile, went to their deaths nobly and with a clear conscience (D&C 135:4). In the immediate wake of their deaths, John Taylor wrote:

> Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. In the short space of twenty years, he has brought forth the Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift and power of God, and has been the means of publishing it on two continents; has sent the fulness of the everlasting gospel, which it contained, to the four quarters of the earth; has brought forth the revelations and commandments which compose this book of Doctrine and Covenants, and many other wise documents and instructions for the benefit of the children of men; gathered many thousands of the Latter-day Saints, founded a great city, and left a fame and name that cannot be slain. He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the Lord's anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood; and so has his brother Hyrum. In life they were not divided, and in death they were not separated! (D&C 135:3)

Oaks (a legal scholar before being called as an apostle) and Marvin S. Hill wrote, ""The murder of Joseph and Hyrum Smith at Carthage, Illinois, was not a spontaneous, impulsive act by a few personal enemies of the Mormon leaders, but a deliberate political assassination, committed or condoned by some of the leading citizens in Hancock County.""13, 46."") Nauvoo was the largest city in Illinois at the time, and Joseph was the mayor and a presidential candidate.14; Derek R. Sainsbury, Storming the Nation: The Unknown Contributions of Joseph Smith's Political Missionaries (Provo, UT: BYU Religious Studies Center; Salt Lake City, UT: Deseret Book, 2020)."") Hyrum was vice mayor and running for office in the state legislature. Politically, they were ""two of the most influential men in Illinois"" at the time.15 As such, their assassinations are not only important to Latter-day Saint history, but also the history of the state of Illinois.

The men who colluded together to kill Joseph and Hyrum had a diverse and complex set of motives for their actions—thus understanding *why* these two influential leaders were murdered is complex and involves numerous different factors. As Bentley explains:

> Many factors contributed to the Prophet's murder on June 27, 1844. Among these were fear of the Nauvoo Legion's power; perceived abuses related to powers granted under the Nauvoo Charter; political unrest caused by the rapidly increasing Mormon population in Hancock County, Illinois, and Lee County, Iowa; economic competition with some of the leading Mormon opponents; persisting grudges among some Missourians; rumors distorting the beginnings of the limited practice of plural marriage; criticism of Joseph Smith's presidential campaign; and the concentration of legislative, judicial, executive, military, and religious power in one man, Joseph Smith.16

At one point, Dan Jones overheard the leaders of this group ""say that they did not expect to prove anything against [Joseph], but that they had eighteen accusations against him, and that as one failed they would try another to detain him"" in Carthage.3: 97."") Once they were detained, anti-Mormon mobs whipped up into a frenzy by the charged rhetoric published by Sharp and others would seize the opportunity to execute the Prophet and his brother in an act of what they perceived as ""vigilante justice.""

This plan was put into action as early as February 26, 1844, when the Law brothers and their collaborators instituted or appealed a series of lawsuits to Carthage. Already at this point, Joseph suspected a darker plot at work than merely resolving legal differences.4 After those lawsuits were consolidated and dismissed, the dissenters initiated additional legal suits in May. Eventually, some of these were successful in getting Joseph out of Nauvoo, and thus he was in Carthage on May 27, 1844, exactly one month before his martyrdom. On that occasion, Charles Foster—one of the conspirators—evidently had a temporary change of heart and notified Joseph of a plan to have him assassinated the next day. With this advance notice, Joseph was able to muster ""enough well-armed troops … from Nauvoo to guarantee Joseph's protection,"" and he subsequently returned home safely.5",1,

This was not a spontaneous or unexpected event—Joseph himself anticipated that he went ""as a lamb to the slaughter"" (Doctrine and Covenants 135:4) and had in fact feared for his life for at least several months, perhaps longer. And he had good reason to fear—there was, in fact, a murderous plot to have him and his brother kidnapped and killed.

According to the recent analysis of legal scholar Joseph I. Bentley, the key Nauvoo apostates were a trio of brothers, William and Wilson Law, Robert and Charles Foster, and Francis and Chauncey Higbee. They colluded with prominent anti-Mormons such as Thomas Sharp, a newspaper editor in the nearby town of Warsaw, Illinois. Whether or not they hatched ""a well-planned conspiracy,"" Bentley argues, ""they undoubtedly went forward, acting deliberately and concertedly.""1: 26."") They acted through a series of ""legal maneuvers"" that were ""intentionally designed … for the purpose of placing Joseph Smith's life in mortal danger in Carthage.""2",3,

Reading the Book of Mormon brought answers to his search for truth. He said,

>
> When I saw a man without eloquence, or talents for public speaking, who could only say, ""I know, by the power of the Holy Ghost, that the Book of Mormon is true, that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of the Lord,"" the Holy Ghost proceeding from that individual illuminated my understanding, and light, glory, and immortality were before me.1

Anxious to meet the translator of the Book of Mormon, Brigham journeyed from New York to Kirtland, Ohio. ""When I went to Kirtland I had not a coat in the world,"" he recalled. ""Neither had I a shoe to my feet, and I had to borrow a pair of pants and a pair of boots.""2 Of meeting Joseph Smith, Brigham recalled, ""Here my joy was full at the privilege of shaking the hand of the Prophet of God, and receiving the sure testimony, by the spirit of prophecy, that he was all that any man could believe him to be as a true Prophet.""3

Brigham served missions and defended Joseph against persecutors no matter the personal inconvenience. When overhearing a man loudly rail against the Prophet one night, he didn't hesitate to jump in the fray:

>
> I put my pants and shoes on, took my cowhide, went out, and laying hold on him, jerked him round, and assured him that if he did not stop his noise and let the people enjoy their sleep without interruption, I would cowhide him on the spot, for we had the Lord's Prophet right here, and we did not want the devil's prophet yelling round the streets. The nuisance was forthwith abated.4

They began by denouncing Joseph as a fallen prophet, proceeded to considering how Joseph could be overthrown, and concluded with specific planning to kill him. All of this the two young men reported to the Prophet Joseph after each meeting.

Before the third meeting, the Prophet foresaw what would happen and told the young men this would be the last meeting. He warned them that the conspirators might kill them when they refused the required oath to participate in the murderous scheme. He said he did not think the conspirators would shed their blood because they were so young, but he called upon their loyalty and courage in these words: ""Don't flinch. If you have to die, die like men, you will be martyrs to the cause, and your crowns can be no greater.""8 He renewed his original caution that they should not make any promises or enter into any covenants with the conspirators. Then he blessed them and expressed his love for their willingness to risk their lives for him.

As Joseph had foreseen, the third and final meeting required all present to unite in a solemn oath to destroy Joseph Smith. When the two boys refused, explaining that Joseph had never harmed them and they were unwilling to participate in his destruction, the leaders declared that since the boys knew the group's plans, they must agree to join them or they must die on the spot. Knives were drawn.

Some protested killing the boys, especially since their parents knew of their presence, so their failure to return would cast suspicion on some of the conspirators. By the barest margin, the cautious course was chosen, and those who opposed killing prevailed. The boys were threatened with certain death if they ever revealed what had transpired in the meetings or who had participated, and they were then allowed to leave unharmed.",2,

While they were gone, events in Nauvoo deteriorated. Joseph Smith was arrested and, on June 27, was killed with his brother Hyrum when a mob stormed the jail where they were being held (see Carthage Jail; Martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith). Brigham was in the Boston area and did not hear definite word of the assassination until July 16. He and his companions immediately rushed back to Nauvoo, arriving August 6. After a dramatic confrontation with Sidney Rigdon on August 8, Brigham and the Twelve were sustained to lead the Church (see Succession in the Presidency). Brigham remained the leader until his death in 1877.

Although privately committed to leaving Nauvoo, Brigham and his associates were determined to complete the Nauvoo Temple so that the Saints could receive their temple ordinances. Even as they labored to defend themselves and finish the temple, they held meetings to decide on when and where to move farther west. Soon after violence erupted in September 1845, they publicly announced their intention to leave by the following spring. By December the temple was ready for ordinance work, and by February nearly 6,000 members had received temple blessings therein. The Saints had also spent the fall and winter preparing for the exodus. Committees were appointed, and a Nauvoo Covenant was signed, helping to ensure that those with property would assist those without.

Partly because of concerns about governmental intervention, Brigham Young began the migration in the cold and snow of February 1846 rather than await spring. By hundreds, then by thousands, people, animals, and wagons crossed the Mississippi River and trudged across Iowa mud to a winter quarters (now Florence, Nebraska) on the Missouri River. In late spring nearly 16,000 Saints were on the road.",2,

Brigham's darkest day was on June 27, 1844, the day the Prophet Joseph was killed in Carthage. Brigham wrote, ""Spent the day in Boston with brother Woodruff . . .

In the midst of that tragedy, competing voices arose seeking to fill the leadership void left behind by the Prophet. As Brother Brigham humbly sought to do the Lord's will and what was best for the Saints, many witnessed the mantle of Joseph miraculously pass to Brigham Young.7, 395–429 (transcriptions of all the primary sources of this event are available on pp. 430–507). See also Arrington, Brigham Young, 113–117."")

The Prophet's mantle came with many responsibilities, including the charge to share the Book of Mormon with the world. Brigham had already played a key role in taking the Book of Mormon oversees as an apostle. He presided over the Church in Great Britain, where he and other members of the Quorum of the Twelve oversaw the publication of the 1841 Liverpool edition of the Book of Mormon—the first edition printed outside the United States.8, 67–78.

Like others who settled out west, the Saints ran into many conflicts with the Native Americans, but because of the belief that they were ""Lamanites,"" Brigham attempted to establish more benevolent policies toward the Native Americans, though they were not always followed.11, 177–191."")

In reaction to this threat, Joseph declared martial law in Nauvoo, calling out the Nauvoo Legion to protect the city from invasion. The threatened invasion never came, and after Governor Ford met with Joseph's enemies in Warsaw and Carthage, he insisted that Joseph come to Carthage to stand trial yet again for the riot charge. The Governor guaranteed Joseph that he would be protected. However, he insisted on disarming the Nauvoo Legion in order to keep the peace, but did not disarm the other militias at the same time.

Once in Carthage, Joseph and other defendants were arraigned on the riot charge and posted bail when the Higbees deliberately failed to present witnesses and asked for their case to be rescheduled for September. Before Joseph and Hyrum could leave Carthage, however, they were charged with treason for having declared martial law—yet another legal charge that lacked any legal merit, but was useful because treason was a non-bailable offense. This prevented Joseph and Hyrum from leaving, and left them trapped in Carthage Jail, vulnerable to mob action.

Inside the jail, Hyrum read from the book of Ether in the Book of Mormon and Joseph bore a strong testimony to the guards of the truthfulness of the Restoration, of the Book of Mormon, and of the visitations of angels. Outside, the mob, eventually numbering about 2,000, was able to mobilize, with people standing ready to join from Missouri, and then come to Carthage and assassinate Joseph and Hyrum late in the afternoon of June 27, 1844.12",2,

Early in his career, the Prophet had recorded that the Lord told him, ""Even if they do unto you&#133;as they have done unto me, blessed are ye, for you shall dwell with me in glory"" (D&C 6:30). Church leaders then and now have taught that the shedding of these martyrs' innocent blood was necessary to seal their testimony of the latter-day work that they ""might be honored and the wicked might be condemned"" (D&C 136:39).

Scientifically this account leaves many questions unanswered, especially how a measurable depth could cover mountains. Elder John A. Widtsoe, writing in 1943, offered this perspective:
The fact remains that the exact nature of the flood is not known. We set up assumptions, based upon our best knowledge, but can go no further. We should remember that when inspired writers deal with historical incidents they relate that which they have seen or that which may have been told them, unless indeed the past is opened to them by revelation.

* ***Global flood******: 4,500 years ago***

The great flood didn't have to be global. That was in the days before cars, trains, planes, etc. It was not common for people to travel long distances when it would have had to have been on foot, camel, or horseback. For many people, traveling more than a few hundred miles in any direction during the course of their lifetimes would have been unthinkable. So, it would have been natural for a large local flood to seem like it flooded the entire world.

When Church leaders refer to it, they do tend to refer to it as a global flood because that's what the scriptures say. But they also occasionally say otherwise. For example, in the *Encyclopedia of Mormonism*, John A. Widtsoe is quoted as saying:

> *The fact remains that the exact nature of the flood is not known. We set up assumptions, based upon our best knowledge, but can go no further.

### FAIR's Response

#### Fact checking results: The author has stated erroneous information or misinterpreted their sources

 The Church does not require a belief in a global flood, despite BYU professor Donald W. Parry's article in the *Ensign*. What the Church teaches is that Noah was a real prophet, and that he was commanded to save his family along with a number of animals in an ark from a flood which covered his world.

**Longer response(s) to criticism:**

* Question: How do Latter-day Saints reconcile scriptural accounts of the Flood of Noah with scientific evidence of continuous human habitation on the earth?

Heavenly Father clearly feels that the exact details are less important than the lessons we can learn from this story, and He hasn't seen fit to clarify the matter.

There are massive ziggurats and their ruins all over Mesopotamia even today, including an especially large one in what was once ancient Babylon, and one of them easily could have been the Tower of Babel. So, just like the Flood, the confusion of languages at the tower could have been a localized event (the Hebrew word for ""earth"" that was used in that story also could have meant ""land""). It also could have been symbolic. The only things that we know for certain is that it was not a worldwide confusion of languages, and that the Jaredites fled from the Tower so that their own language would not be corrupted.",2,

In Moses 6:28 the Lord explained to Enoch that He would send the flood because ""in [the people's] own abominations have they devised murder, and have not kept the commandments."" These ""abominations"" were first introduced by Cain, who slew his brother Abel (Moses 5:25). In response to Cain's murder, the Lord declared, ""The voice of thy brother's blood cries unto me from the ground"" (v. 35).

Thus, in both accounts, the floods were sent because of ""abominations"" which are scripturally linked with the shedding of innocent blood—blood which symbolically calls out from the ground for divine justice.13."") The Lord wanted the people to understand that He was bound by His own law to exact justice for the spilling of innocent blood. The rising waters symbolically hid the people's wickedness and abominations from before the face of the Lord,14. See also 2 Nephi 9:14, Mormon 9:5; Lamentations 1:8; Isaiah 47:3; Revelation 3:18.

This type of literary repetition and borrowing found in separate stories can be seen in the Bible as well. For instance, aspects of the construction of the Israelite tabernacle have been found to mirror Noah's construction of the Ark, which in turn mirrors the creation of the world.44

In a similar way, the story of the Jaredite exodus found in the book of Ether may intentionally hark back to stories of a previous flood hero, some of which may have been known to the brother of Jared and his people. It is possible, and potentially useful, to read the brother of Jared's experience as a refutation or correction to Mesopotamian views about gods and man. Importantly, the non-biblical flood stories were only published in English after the translation of the Book of Mormon, making them inaccessible to Joseph Smith.",1,

Parents, families, friends, and donors to the General Missionary Fund may also assist. All missionaries, younger and older, serve with the sole hope of making life better for other people.

The decision to serve a mission will shape the spiritual destiny of the missionary, his or her spouse, and their posterity for generations to come. A desire to serve is a natural outcome of one's conversion, worthiness, and preparation.

In this great worldwide audience, many of you are not affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and know very little about us and our missionaries. You are here or tuned in because you want to know more about the Mormons and what our missionaries teach. As you learn more about us, you will find that we share many of the same values. We encourage you to keep all that is good and true and then see if we can add more. In this world filled with challenges, we do need help from time to time. Religion, eternal truth, and our missionaries are vital parts of that help.

Our young missionaries set aside their education, occupation, dating, and whatever else young adults would typically be doing at this stage of life. For 18 to 24 months they put it all on hold because of their deep desire to serve the Lord.2 And some of our missionaries serve in their more mature years of life. I know their families are blessed. In our own family, eight are currently serving as full-time missionaries—three daughters, their husbands, one granddaughter, and one grandson.",3,

He said, ""I don't want to go."" I asked, ""What has that got to do with it? We need you.""

President Kimball has said we don't have *half enough* missionaries. Can't you see that it doesn't matter whether you want to go or not? You're needed! Do you know what it means to be needed? The bonds of brotherhood are forged deep and strong in the mission field. You will develop a love for a companion with whom you kneel in daily prayer. You will learn to love the people where you serve, no matter what nationality or condition. And they will love you. They will love you because you brought them the gospel.

Converts always remember those who taught them. I've heard many converts speak almost reverently of ""our missionaries."" Imagine having people pray for you. Do you understand what that means? This will always be a purifying and refining influence in your life.

Many people out there are praying for the truth. You are the one who can bring it to them best. At present only 18,000 of you are serving. There are nearly 60,000, 19 through 25, who have not. We need more, many more. Missionary service is not preempted by any other thing. Marriage does not take precedence. Your work does not have priority. Your education is interrupted to fill this calling. College-related activities may be timed to satisfy both school and mission requirements. Some of you may be physically handicapped. There may yet be opportunity to serve in fitting ways locally.

Your moral worthiness is a prime consideration. We want no flabbiness of character when spiritual strength is required. Study! Get some colored pencils. Keep them with your Book of Mormon. Underline verses important to you. Another tool of missionary work is an additional language. Study one. We should ""become acquainted with … languages, tongues, and people."" (D&C 90:15.)",2,

I grew up in a home with very good parents, but my father was not a member and my mother was less active. After my mission that changed. They became strong members and served devotedly in the temple—he a sealer, she an ordinance worker. But as a young man, like many of you today, I had no way to judge personally the importance of a mission. I fell in love with an exceptional young woman. At a critical point in our courtship, she made it very clear that she would only be married in the temple to a returned missionary. Duly motivated, I served a mission in Uruguay.

It was not easy. The Lord gave me many challenges that became stepping-stones to personal growth. There I gained my testimony that God the Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, did in fact visit Joseph Smith to begin a restoration of truth, priesthood authority, and the true Church on earth. I gained a witness that Joseph Smith is a singular prophet. I learned essential doctrines. I discovered what it meant to be led by the Spirit. Many a night I got up as my companion slept to pour my heart out to the Lord for guidance and direction. I pled for the ability to express effectively in Spanish my testimony and the truth I was learning to a people I had come to love. Those prayers were abundantly answered. At the same time, my future eternal companion, Jeanene, was being molded to become an exceptional wife and mother by her own mission.",1,

Thirty-five years after I served my first mission, I received a letter from a family whom I had taught but did not baptize. The letter shared that their family of four little children whom I once knew now consisted of four temple marriages, three full-time missionaries, three bishops, a Relief Society president, and a dozen grandchildren maturing and developing in the gospel. You can well imagine the thrill and joy I received knowing that I had helped to find them and to teach them the gospel of Jesus Christ.

In conclusion, may I testify of the blessings of missionary service. Last year, my father passed away at age 88. As a young man, he was called on a mission during the Depression, when few were able to serve. It was hard and difficult. He always said that his decision to serve a mission was the best decision he ever made. When he died, he left 10 children, 9 living; 56 grandchildren; and 116 great-grandchildren. Of his posterity, 32 served full-time missions and 15 spouses who married into the family had served missions, resulting in 47 full-time missionaries or almost 100 years of full-time missionary work. All of this resulted, in part, because one man served a mission. I shall be forever grateful that my father served a mission and that I was motivated and taught to follow his example.

I bear witness of this great privilege we all have in the Church—to be missionaries. Inherent in our responsibility of holding the priesthood is to be a missionary. I pray that we will all fulfill that obligation we have to the Lord. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",2,

Now I can hear President Grant standing here, saying, ""That was the straw that broke the camel's back."" The man said, ""He's our only child. His mother will miss him. We can't let him go."" Then the bishop countered, ""Brother So-and-So, who do you love in this world more than anyone else outside of your own relatives?"" And he thought for a few minutes. He said, ""I guess I love that young man who came up to the land of the midnight sun and taught me the gospel of Jesus Christ.""

Now you fathers, how would you like someone to love your boys just like that man loved that boy who came up to the land of the midnight sun and taught him the gospel? I heard a missionary up in Oregon giving the report of his mission. He himself was a convert to the Church, and he came down with his fist on the pulpit, and he said, ""I wouldn't take a check tonight for a million dollars for the experience of my mission."" I sat back of him, and I said to myself, ""Would you take a million dollars for your first mission in the little land of Holland?""

Best of all, I have Sister Holland at my side, rather than leaving her at home to fend for herself and our children. Furthermore, I did not have to do manual labor along the way in order to earn the fare to Santiago. We flew to our destination for a few hours in a modern jet airliner rather than sailing for weeks, even months, in the steerage of a ship. I did not leave suffering with chills and fever, cholera, or consumption, although I did have a cold and one leg of our flight was delayed an hour. I have hoped these hardships would qualify me to one day face Peter and Paul, Brigham and Wilford.

As did many of you, I grew up on the stories of the early brethren going to Canada, England, Scandinavia, continental Europe, the Pacific Islands, Mexico, Asia, and so on. More recently I have read of Parley P. Pratt's brief mission to Chile, where the Pratts lost and buried their infant son at Valparaíso. I have read of Elder Melvin J. Ballard, who was called to dedicate South America when that marvelous continent was still one new and rather overwhelming mission field. The service which builds a young, growing Church is not casually requested nor whimsically given. On occasion the obstacles have been great and the price sometimes very dear.

As you prayerfully seek and cultivate missionary opportunities in your daily activities, you will find many ways to serve. They include helping to find, convert, and retain new members. The stake or full-time missionaries can teach you how to do that.

You can help the full-time and stake missionaries bring new investigators to church and make them feel comfortable. Let them know that they have a new friend. Strengthen that friendship by inviting them to your home or to Church activities with you. You can support them in obeying the commandments. Such valuable missionary service is not difficult because it can be carried out in the normal routine of your daily life.

There are other ways you may not think of as missionary service. For example, a young mother can teach each growing son to prepare to be a missionary to preach the gospel and to share his testimony of truth. As mother and father cultivate that thought throughout his growing years, he will be a missionary. That is excellent missionary service.",0,

And one way to make sure that your boys will go on missions is to start a missionary fund for them and let them keep adding to it, and they will be on their missions from the time that they are young boys. For instance, down in California I went to a ward, and the bishop has a program of giving to each boy when he's ordained a deacon fifteen dollars out of the missionary fund. Then they ask the father to match it, and then every time the boy is interviewed—for instance, when he's ordained a teacher—they check on his missionary fund. I figured, on a percentage basis, if every ward in the Church had as many missionaries in the field as that ward, we would have 55,500 missionaries. So I provided in my family that every male child who has not been on a mission has a missionary fund so he will know that he is on his mission from the time he is a boy.

God bless you all, and may we not disappoint our great leader in sending all of our boys on missions, I pray, and I leave you my blessing, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.",3,

Missionary work results in many rejections. It is easy to be discouraged.

Third, be obedient, faithful, and true. Missionaries serve in companionships for protection. A missionary best protects his companion when he is loyal to the Lord and helps his companion. By keeping the missionary rules, you gain the freedom of having the Spirit assist you.

They learn by their sacrifice what only personal experience and devoted service to others can teach.

A missionary learns, for example, that God can use him as an instrument to accomplish His work. He can say, as did Ammon, a Book of Mormon missionary, ""This is [a] blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work."" (Alma 26:3.)

A missionary learns that he must be humble and dependent on the Lord. He learns to pray with fervor and sincerity, not only for himself but for others, and to be led and directed by the Spirit.

Four Sons of Mosiah Kneeling in Prayer by Harold T. Dale Kilbourrn

Just like the missionaries in the Book of Mormon, today's missionaries must sometimes make real and burdensome sacrifices. Elder Neil L. Andersen has taught, ""There will always be something you leave behind when you respond to the prophet's call to serve.""7 Whether this means giving up a sports scholarship, postponing education or career opportunities, or leaving behind family members in times of financial or emotional strain, the Lord will always bless those who faithfully serve.

Alma and the sons of Mosiah demonstrated their understanding of this principle through complete dedication to their missionary service. After giving up their royal privileges and political influence, they fully devoted their attention to those whom they were serving. So too should missionaries today give up any desires or interests that might interfere with their complete dedication to serve the Lord.8",3,

We are all thrilled as we go through the Church to find the wonderful attitude that the Saints have toward President Kimball and, particularly, toward the emphasis that he is giving to missionary work. You know that he has indicated that every boy should be a missionary.

I think of when I was a young man, before I was even ordained a deacon, I went to one of our ward meetings in the little country town where I was raised, and two missionaries reported their missions down in the Southern States. In those days they traveled without purse or scrip, and they had to sleep out many nights when they couldn't get entertainment. I don't know whether they said anything unusual that night or not; but if they didn't, the Lord did something unusual for me, because when I left that meeting, I felt like I could have walked to any mission field in the world, if I just had a call. And I went home, went into my little bedroom, and got down on my knees, and asked the Lord to help me to live worthy so that when I was old enough I could go on a mission. And when the train finally left the station here in Salt Lake and I was headed for the little land of Holland, the last thing I said to my loved ones was, ""This is the happiest day of my life.""",0,

He is now a member of the Church. A few months ago he, like you and me, had a decision to make. He had to decide whether or not to serve a mission. Jose Manuel had every reason in the world not to go. He was just a recent convert. His knowledge of the gospel wasn't that extensive. He had lost his father a few years before, and his mother didn't want him to go. Other family members didn't want him to go either. He didn't have the finances to be able to serve for eighteen months. He also had to complete his military service before he would be able to even think about serving a mission. Everything was against his going on a mission.

Every one of us, as we think about a mission, can find a number of reasons why we shouldn't go. We must each look beyond those reasons. The key is to look for reasons to go. And Jose Manuel had some reasons to go. He knew that Jesus Christ was the son of God and the Savior of the world. He knew that Joseph Smith had seen a vision. He knew that the Church was true. He knew that it had changed his life, and he wanted to go out and share that knowledge with others.",2,

If you are a young man wondering whether you ought to fulfill a full-time mission, don't approach that vital decision with your own wisdom alone. Seek the counsel of your parents, your bishop, or stake president. In your prayers ask to have the will of the Lord made known to you. I know that a mission will provide extraordinary blessings for you now and throughout your life. I urge you not to pray to know whether you should go; rather, ask the Lord to guide you in whatever may be necessary to become a worthy, empowered full-time missionary. You will never regret serving a mission, but you most probably will regret not serving if that is your choice.",3,

Faithful Latter-day Saints should not be afraid to honestly admit that DNA analysis is inconclusive. The Book of Mormon holds up well under scrutiny and does not need to be propped up by improper use of science. While genetic studies do not offer the evidence some have hoped for, many other disciplines such as archaeology, anthropology, linguistics, geography, geology, literary studies, and ancient legal studies continue to yield fruitful evidence which both supports and sheds light on Book of Mormon narratives.21.

The DNA argument may sound like a solid scientific argument against the Book of Mormon, but in reality it has no teeth. The smartest critics are painfully aware of this fact. To add teeth (more like dentures) to their charge, the critics hitch their arguments to statements made by 19th century church leaders who believed that the descendants of Book of Mormon people account for all or most all of the ancient Americans. Unfortunately for the critics, Latter-day Saints don't believe that an LDS prophet suddenly becomes a robot who is unable to have his own thoughts and opinions (even if those opinions are wrong).

Scholarly studies clearly indicate that the Book of Mormon peoples were a small clan who migrated into the larger population of existing ancient American cultures. Under such conditions (and this is even admitted by the critics), their DNA markers would likely disappear.",3,

Simply assuming it looked like DNA from the modern Middle East can be deeply misleading. A common problem in population genetics, known as *founder effect*, appears when the founders of a population had atypical genetic markers for the region they came from. For instance, an LDS geneticist from Italy found that his paternal genetic marker was more typical of East Asian ancestry. If something similar was the case with the founders of Book of Mormon populations, identifying their descendants using DNA would be impossible.10, 179–192. ""Unfortunately, no matter how large or small they eventually became as a people in the American continent, Lehi's family still was a very small initial group with extremely limited genetic variation that would not constitute a large enough sample of their native population to ensure that their genetics would be properly represented in the New World"" (p. 186)."")

Even if Jared's, Mulek's, and Lehi's DNA were typical of the regions of their origins, the reality is that most genetic information from the past does not survive into present populations. Most DNA studies on Native Americans are dependent upon DNA markers which pass from one generation to the next along paternal and maternal lines. Because such markers do not get mixed from one generation to the next, these lineages are easy to trace back several generations. However, in total they only represent 0.01 percent of a person's DNA.11, 249."")",3,

We don't have any idea what Jaredite DNA would have looked like. We don't know where they came from, who they mixed with along their journey, or where they ended up, or if any of that DNA spread to existing populations. We don't have any idea what Sariah's lineage was, or Zoram's, or Ishmael's wife's. All we know is that Lehi is from the tribe of Manasseh and, as explained by Don Bradley, Ishmael was from the tribe of Ephraim. We don't know what Mulekite DNA would have looked like, as we have no idea who helped him escape Jerusalem or what route they took along the way, or who may have been added to their group during their travels. We have no idea which native populations any of them intermingled with, or to what extent. And that's even assuming his story in the Book of Mormon is an accurate description of what really happened to him and wasn't distorted over the centuries before his people were discovered by the Nephites. Given all of that, we have absolutely no idea what the genetic makeup of the groups in the Book of Mormon even looked like to begin with, let alone what it might look like when it's mixed with existing Native populations.

As the Church's Gospel Topics essay on DNA says, ""It is possible that each member of the emigrating parties described in the Book of Mormon had DNA typical of the Near East, but it is likewise possible that some of them carried DNA more typical of other regions. In this case, their descendants might inherit a genetic profile that would be unexpected given their family's place of origin. This phenomenon is called the founder effect.""",3,

In addition to the bottlenecks documented in the Book of Mormon (Alma 43–62; 3 Nephi 8–10; Mormon 2–6), the pre-Columbian American population underwent one of the largest bottlenecks in human history after European contact, when perhaps up to 90 percent of the population died off.16: 35–90; reprinted in The Book of Mormon and DNA Research, 99–155."")

Finally, in the unlikely event that some DNA from the founding members of Book of Mormon peoples did survive in the present day, detection is complicated by post-Columbian admixture of Native Americans and Old World peoples.

 The implication by the author is that the Church retreated from the definition of ""Lamanite"" by altering the introduction to the Book of Mormon that was added in the 1920's. This is incorrect. If Lehi's people intermarried with *anyone* from the existing New World population, then by definition they are certainly among the ancestors of every native American currently living, and thus qualify under the Church's definition of ""Lamanite."" The only way critics can make the DNA data to be a weapon against the Book of Mormon is to *force* a hemispheric interpretation of an empty North and South American continent at the time of arrival of the Lehites. This is why critics *must*, at all costs, negate the Limited Geography Theory of the Book of Mormon.

The eternal laws that pertain to chastity before marriage and personal purity within marriage apply to *all* sexual behavior. However, ""marriage is not doctrinal therapy for homosexual relations"" (Oaks, p. 10). The restored gospel of Jesus Christ exalts the relationship of husband and wife, as particularly illustrated in the temple ordinances. From these doctrines, covenants, and ordinances, it is clear that any sexual relationship other than that between a legally wedded heterosexual husband and wife is sinful. The divine mandate of marriage between man and woman puts in perspective why homosexual acts are offensive to God. They repudiate the gift and the Giver of eternal life.

Recognizing that failure to keep the covenants of the gospel of Jesus Christ deprives a person of God's blessings, the Church offers counseling to help those who are troubled by homosexual thoughts or actions to learn to use their agency to live in accord with divine laws and thereby enjoy the rich blessings a benevolent Father offers to all his children, whatever their temptation or thoughts. ""That has been the message of the Jewish and Christian prophets in all ages: repent. Abandon your sins; confess them; forsake them. And become acceptable to God"" (Oaks, p. 7).

Several publications are now being circulated about the Church which defend and promote gay or lesbian conduct. They wrest the scriptures attempting to prove that these impulses are inborn, cannot be overcome, and should not be resisted; and therefore, such conduct has a morality of its own. They quote scriptures to justify perverted acts between consenting adults. That same logic would justify incest or the molesting of little children of either gender. Neither the letter nor the spirit of moral law condones any such conduct.

I hope none of our young people will be foolish enough to accept those sources as authority for what the scriptures mean. Paul, speaking on this very subject, condemned those ""who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator."" (Rom. 1:25.) In that same reference the word *covenantbreakers* is used for the only time in scripture. (See Rom. 1:31.)

Some choose to reject the scriptures out of hand and forsake their covenants. But they cannot choose to avoid the consequences. That choice is not theirs or ours or anybody's.

All of us are subject to feelings and impulses. Some are worthy and some of them are not; some of them are natural and some of them are not. We are to control them, meaning we are to direct them according to the moral law.

The legitimate union of the sexes is a law of God. The sacred covenants made by husband and wife with God protect the worthy expression of those feelings and impulses which are vital to the continuation of the race and essential to a happy family life. Illicit or perverted conduct leads without exception to disappointment, suffering, to tragedy.",3,

My response is that we love them as sons and daughters of God. They may have certain inclinations which are powerful and which may be difficult to control. Most people have inclinations of one kind or another at various times. If they do not act upon these inclinations, then they can go forward as do all other members of the Church. If they violate the law of chastity and the moral standards of the Church, then they are subject to the discipline of the Church, just as others are.

We want to help these people, to strengthen them, to assist them with their problems and to help them with their difficulties. But we cannot stand idle if they indulge in immoral activity, if they try to uphold and defend and live in a so-called same-sex marriage situation. To permit such would be to make light of the very serious and sacred foundation of God-sanctioned marriage and its very purpose, the rearing of families.

Like the Savior, His followers are sometimes confronted by sinful behavior, and today when they hold out for right and wrong as they understand it, they are sometimes called ""bigots"" or ""fanatics."" Many worldly values and practices pose such challenges to Latter-day Saints. Prominent among these today is the strong tide that is legalizing same-sex marriage in many states and provinces in the United States and Canada and many other countries in the world. We also live among some who don't believe in marriage at all. Some don't believe in having children. Some oppose any restrictions on pornography or dangerous drugs. Another example—familiar to most believers—is the challenge of living with a nonbelieving spouse or family member or associating with nonbelieving fellow workers.

In dedicated spaces, like temples, houses of worship, and our own homes, we should teach the truth and the commandments plainly and thoroughly as we understand them from the plan of salvation revealed in the restored gospel. Our right to do so is protected by constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and religion, as well as by the privacy that is honored even in countries without formal constitutional guarantees.",3,
