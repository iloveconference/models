Having this back-up copy of the entire Book of Mormon has proved to be more than just of incidental importance. Although only about 25–30 percent of the Original Manuscript has survived,19 all but three lines of the Printer's Manuscript is intact and readily available as a phenomenal resource in studying and confirming the words originally dictated by the Prophet.20

Oliver was also called and trusted by God to be one of the Three Witnesses who saw the angel Moroni and the gold plates. His role as witness was important enough to have been prophesied centuries before by Nephi and Moroni (2 Nephi 27:12; Ether 5:4). Oliver's testimony of the Book of Mormon was of vital importance his entire life. Even while out of the Church, Oliver was insistent that his validity as a witness to the Book of Mormon and other restoration events in no way be discredited.21 In many minds, his time away from the Church strengthens the credibility of his testimony.

Once the book was printed, he was among the first to take the Book of Mormon to the world. He also served as Assistant President of the Church (1834–1837), and he, together with Martin Harris and David Whitmer, ordained the first members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1835. Oliver's personal sacrifices as a scribe, witness, missionary, and in his many other roles as one of the founding leaders of the Church deserve the utmost gratitude from all who embrace the Book of Mormon.",2.0

The young teacher prayed and received answers that Joseph Smith mentioned in a revelation (D&C 6:14-24). The Prophet's first history states the ""Lord appeared unto&#133;Oliver Cowdery and shewed unto him the plates in a vision and&#133;what the Lord was about to do through me, his unworthy servant. Therefore he was desirous to come and write for me to translate"" (*PJS* 1:10).

From April 7 through the end of June 1829, when they finished the translation, Joseph dictated while Oliver wrote, with ""utmost gratitude"" for the privilege (*Messenger and Advocate* 1:14). Oliver penned a letter then, expressing deep love for Christ, a lifetime theme. He later told how he and Joseph interrupted their work as they were translating the record of the Savior's post-resurrection American ministry, and how, as they prayed about baptism, they heard the ""voice of the Redeemer"" and were ministered to by John the Baptist, who gave them authority to baptize (JS-H 1:71,note).

In 1835 Oliver helped Joseph Smith correct and publish the revelations for the Doctrine and Covenants. Section 27 lists the major priesthood messengers of the restoration: John the Baptist, whom ""I have sent unto you, my servants, Joseph Smith, Jr., and Oliver Cowdery, to ordain you unto this first priesthood"" (D&C 27:8); and ""Peter, James, and John, whom I have sent unto you, by whom I have ordained you and confirmed you to be apostles and especial witnesses of my name, and bear the keys of your ministry"" (D&C 27:12).",2.0

From April 1829 to April 1838 Oliver Cowdery was a close associate and friend of the Prophet Joseph. He scribed most of the Book of Mormon as Joseph translated the sacred writ. On May 15, 1829 he and Joseph received the Aaronic Priesthood on the banks of the Susquehanna River from John the Baptist and the Melchizedek Priesthood from ancient apostles Peter, James, and John a few weeks later.

According to Richard L. Anderson, throughout Cowdery's life, ""He told the same simple story of the vision, whether under privation, persecution, resentment against the translator of the Book of Mormon, ridicule by non-Mormons, or knowledge of imminent death.""15

Whereas Oliver Cowdery sacrificed considerable time and energy to help with the translation process, Martin Harris fronted ""the entire cost of the publication of the Book of Mormon"" by mortgaging ""most of his property.""16 Harris also spent considerable time and energy seeking to authenticate the characters on the gold plates.17

When asked by the twelve-year-old William Glenn if he had indeed seen the plates and the angel, Harris declared, ""Gentlemen, do you see that hand? Are you sure you see it? Are your eyes playing you a trick or something? No. Well, as sure as you see my hand so sure did I see the angel and the plates.""18 With similar conviction, and often using similar analogies with concrete descriptions, Martin Harris reaffirmed his testimony over and over throughout his long life.19: 5–27."")

Moreover, his speeches and writings carry the tone of personal knowledge. Generally serving as editor or associate editor in the first publications of the Church, Oliver wrote with unusual consistency through two decades of published writings and personal letters. He insisted that a relationship with God required constant contact: ""Whenever [God] has had a people on earth, he always has revealed himself to them by the Holy Ghost, the ministering of angels, or his own voice"" (*Messenger and Advocate* 1:2). Oliver Cowdery led the Lamanite mission, the first major mission of the Church (D&C 28:8;30:5), which doubled Church membership and took the Book of Mormon to Native Americans. After the temple site was designated in Jackson County in 1831, he traveled there with copies of the revelations for their first printing. Because publishing was vital for spreading the gospel and instructing members, Oliver was called to work with William W. Phelps, an experienced editor (D&C 55:4;57:11-13). After Missouri ruffians destroyed the press, Cowdery returned to Ohio to counsel with Church leaders, who assigned him to relocate Church publications there. Because of the importance of accurate information, he and Sidney Rigdon remained in Ohio in 1834 when many faithful men marched to Missouri with Zion's Camp to assist the Saints in returning to their homes and land in Jackson County.

In 1830-1831, Oliver Cowdery served as the first Church Recorder, a calling he again resumed between 1835 and 1837 (see Historians, Church). Even in other years, he often kept the official minutes of meetings, and was often editor and contributor for the first Church newspapers. He wrote articles for the messenger and advocate that help document early LDS history. From June to October 1830, Oliver served as scribe while the Prophet completed important portions of the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible.",3.0

This messenger laid his hands upon their heads and said:

""Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins. …"" (D&C 13.)

Then Oliver Cowdery, a schoolteacher who learned of the plates from Joseph's parents, believed in Joseph and agreed to take dictation. From April to June 1829 they labored together. When the two friends prayed on May 15 for an understanding of baptism, a messenger who announced himself as John the Baptist appeared, conferred priesthood authority upon them, and instructed them to baptize each other (see Aaronic Priesthood: Restoration). Oliver later wrote: ""These were days never to be forgotten-to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven, awakened the utmost gratitude of this bosom"" (JS-H 1:71n).

Oliver was not the only additional witness to the revelations. When opposition began to build in Harmony, Oliver and Joseph moved in June 1829 to Fayette, New York, to the family home of Oliver's friend David Whitmer. Here again Joseph received needed support from people who believed in him. Once the translation was completed, Joseph was told that others would be allowed to see the plates, which until that time only he had viewed. The angel Moroni appeared to Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer and showed them the gold plates while a voice from heaven declared that the translation was done by the power of God and was true (see Book of Mormon Witnesses). Joseph's mother reported that Joseph came into the house after this revelation and threw himself down beside her, exclaiming that at last someone else had seen the plates. ""Now they know for themselves, that I do not go about to deceive"" (Smith, p. 139). His words suggest the pressure he felt in being the only witness of his remarkable experiences.",3.0

The Bible and the Book of Mormon are both witnesses of Jesus Christ. They teach that He is the Son of God, that He lived an exemplary life, that He atoned for all mankind, that He died upon the cross and rose again as the resurrected Lord. They teach that He is the Savior of the world.

Scriptural witnesses authenticate each other. This concept was explained long ago when a prophet wrote that the Book of Mormon was ""written for the intent that ye may believe [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe [the Book of Mormon] also.""6 Each book refers to the other. Each book stands as evidence that God lives and speaks to His children by revelation to His prophets.7

Love for the Book of Mormon expands one's love for the Bible and vice versa. Scriptures of the Restoration do not compete with the Bible; they complement the Bible. We are indebted to martyrs who gave their lives so that we could have the Bible. It establishes the everlasting nature of the gospel and of the plan of happiness. The Book of Mormon restores and underscores biblical doctrines such as tithing,8 the temple,9 the Sabbath day,10 and the priesthood.11

An angel proclaimed that the Book of Mormon12 shall establish the truth of the Bible.13 He also revealed that writings in the Bible available in our day are not as complete as they were when originally written by prophets and apostles.14 He declared that the Book of Mormon shall restore plain and precious things taken away from the Bible.15",3.0

The Savior referred to the Book of Mormon as His ""new covenant"" with the house of Israel.26 It is a tangible sign of Christ's culminating covenant with mankind.27 The divine teachings of this book, as a third testament, clarify doctrine and unify the Old Testament with the New Testament. Scriptural covenants,28 testaments,29 and witnesses30 since the beginning of time relate to the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the central act of all human history.

Have you ever wondered why there are so many Christian churches in the world today when they obtain their doctrines from essentially the same Bible? It is because they interpret the Bible differently. If they interpreted it the same, they would be the same church. This is not a condition the Lord desires, for the Apostle Paul declared that there is ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism"" (Ephesians 4:5). To help bring this oneness about, the Lord established a divine law of witnesses. Paul taught, ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Corinthians 13:1).

The Bible is one witness of Jesus Christ; the Book of Mormon is another. Why is this second witness so crucial? The following illustration may help: How many straight lines can you draw through a single point on a piece of paper? The answer is infinite. For a moment, suppose that single point represents the Bible and that hundreds of those straight lines drawn through that point represent different interpretations of the Bible and that each of those interpretations represents a different church.

Interesting as these matters may be, study of the Book of Mormon is most rewarding when one focuses on its *primary* purpose—to testify of Jesus Christ. By comparison, all other issues are incidental.

When you read the Book of Mormon, concentrate on the principal figure in the book—from its first chapter to the last—the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God.3 And look for a second undergirding theme: God will keep His covenants with the remnants of the house of Israel.4

The Book of Mormon is a crucial component of that covenant.5 It is holy scripture that encompasses sacred writings from the small and large plates of Nephi, the plates of Mormon, the plates of Ether, and the plates of brass, which contained ""the five books of Moses, … a record of the Jews, … and … prophecies of the holy prophets.""6

No wonder the Book of Mormon proclaims with boldness, ""And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ"" (2 Nephi 33:10).

He declared his doctrine, the fulness of his gospel necessary to enter the kingdom of God; and he established his Church with its essential ordinances, and ordained disciples to preside over the Church. At this time, Christ also explained the promises of God to Israel; healed the sick and disabled; blessed the children and their parents; and expressed his great love, allowing each individual to come forward and touch the wounds he had received during his crucifixion (see 3 Ne. 11-26).

The Bible is primarily a record of God's dealings with the forebears and descendants of Jacob or Israel in the ancient Near East. Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of God's dealings principally with another group of Israelites he brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem about 600 B.C. (see Lehi). They anticipated the birth and coming of Jesus Christ and believed in his Atonement and gospel.

Three mutually supportive avenues are most often followed. First, the book serves as a source of guidance and doctrine, yielding lessons and wisdom applicable to contemporary life. This approach is recommended in the writings of Nephi, who wrote that he ""did liken the scriptures unto [his people], that it might be for [their] profit and learning"" (1 Ne. 19:23). Latter-day Saints find its pages rich with ennobling narratives, clear doctrines, eternal truths, memorable sayings, and principles. Knowing the conditions of the latter days, the ancient prophets periodically address the individual reader directly. Latter-day Saints emphasize the need to read the Book of Mormon prayerfully, with faith in God, to benefit personally from its teachings and to come unto Christ.

A second approach to the Book of Mormon, adding historical dimension to the first approach, is to study the book as an ancient text. The reader who accepts the Book of Mormon as an ancient Hebrew lineage history written by prophets in the New World will find the book consistent with that description and setting. The book is a repository of ancient cultures that are as far removed from modern readers as are those of the Old and New Testaments. Continuing research has found Hebrew poetic forms, rhetorical patterns, and idioms, together with many Mesoamerican symbols, traditions, and artifacts, to be implicit in the book or consistent with it.",3.0

First in importance is the volume's affirmation that the Christian religion is grounded upon both the Old and New Testaments. The book affirms what recent biblical scholarship is now making plain: the continuity of the theology, ethics, and spirituality that the two Testaments proclaimed. In the Book of Mormon, Jesus is the Lord who gave the law to Moses, and the risen Christ is identical to the prophet Isaiah's messiah. He delivers exactly the same message of redemption, faith, and a new life of righteousness through the Holy Spirit that the New Testament attributes to him.

Second, the Book of Mormon reinforces the unifying vision of biblical religion, grounding it in the conviction of a common humanity that the stories of creation declared, God's promise to Abraham implied, and Jesus affirmed. Puritan millenarianism may have inspired an ethnocentric view of Anglo-Saxon destiny, but the image of the future in the Book of Mormon is a wholly opposite one. It envisions a worldwide conversion of believers and their final gathering into the kingdom of God. This begins where John Wesley's ""world parish"" leaves off.

Third, the biblical bond linking holiness to hope for salvation, both individual and social, also finds confirmation in the Book of Mormon. Certainly, Methodists had no corner on that linkage, for Baptist preachers, Charles G. Finney's Congregationalists, Alexander Campbell's Disciples of Christ, and Unitarians like William E. Channing affirmed it. Ancient Nephites heeded the word of their prophets and looked forward to the second coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of Righteousness. When he appeared to their descendants in the New World, Jesus repeated even more understandably the words of the Sermon on the Mount that he had proclaimed in the Old.",3.0

Nephi prophesied that many ""plain and precious"" truths and covenants would be taken from the gospel and the Bible after the deaths of the apostles (1 Ne. 13:26-27). Many questions that have arisen from the Bible are answered for Latter-day Saints by the Book of Mormon, such as the mode of and reasons for baptism (2 Ne. 31; 3 Ne. 11:23-26); the proper way to administer the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper (Moro. 4-5); the nature of the Resurrection (Alma 40); the effects of the Fall of Adam, and the reasons for evil and suffering in the world (2 Ne. 2). The Book of Mormon reinforces the LDS doctrine that the gospel of Jesus Christ existed before the Creation and has been revealed to prophets and believers throughout time.

Also sacred to Latter-day Saints is the Book of Mormon as a tutor in discerning the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Many Latter-day Saints, including those born into LDS families, trace their conversion to Jesus Christ and their commitment toward the Church to prayerful study of the Book of Mormon, and through it they learn to recognize the Holy Spirit. Thus, the book becomes a continuing symbol of personal revelation and of God's love for and attention to the needs of each person. It also declares that all mankind will be judged by its precepts and commandments (Mosiah 3:24; Moro. 10:27; see Judgment). It is evidence that God remembers every creature he has created (Mosiah 27:30) and every covenant he has made (1 Ne. 19:15; 3 Ne. 16:11). The Book of Mormon is the base from which millions have begun a personal journey of spiritual growth and of service to others.",3.0

Moroni states in the book of Ether that the Jaredites gathered for battle near ""the hill Ramah,"" the same hill where his father, Mormon, hid up ""the records unto the Lord, which were sacred"" (Ether 15:11). It was near the first landing site of the people of Mulek (Alma 22:30), just north of the land Bountiful and a narrow neck of land (Alma 22:32).

The more common reference to Cumorah among Latter-day Saints is to the hill near present-day Palmyra and Manchester, New York, where the plates from which the Prophet Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon were found. During the night of September 21, 1823, Moroni 2 appeared to Joseph Smith as an angel sent from God to show him where these plates were deposited (JS-H 1:29-47).

In 1928 the Church purchased the western New York hill and in 1935 erected a monument recognizing the visit of the angel Moroni (see Angel Moroni Statue). A visitors center was later built at the base of the hill. Each summer since 1937, the Church has staged the Cumorah Pageant at this site. Entitled *America's Witness for Christ,* it depicts important events from Book of Mormon history. This annual pageant has reinforced the common assumption that Moroni buried the plates of Mormon in the same hill where his father had buried the other plates, thus equating this New York hill with the Book of Mormon Cumorah. Because the New York site does not readily fit the Book of Mormon description of Book of Mormon geography, some Latter-day Saints have looked for other possible explanations and locations, including Mesoamerica. Although some have identified possible sites that may seem to fit better (Palmer), there are no conclusive connections between the Book of Mormon text and any specific site that has been suggested.",3.0

Much more important than precisely where the Book of Mormon hill Cumorah may be located is what transpired at a ""hill of considerable size"" near the town of Manchester, New York in the early morning hours of September 22, 1827 (Joseph Smith–––History 1:51–59).

This same hill was known centuries earlier by the Jaredites as Ramah (Ether 15:11). Knowing that he and his people faced impending doom, Mormon ""made this record out of the plates of Nephi, and hid up in the hill Cumorah all the records which had been entrusted to me by the hand of the Lord, save it were these few plates which I gave unto my son Moroni"" (Mormon 6:6). That is to say, Mormon deposited what remained of Nephite textual sources in the hill Cumorah for preservation and entrusted the plates of what would later become the published Book of Mormon (the record obtained by Joseph Smith in the nineteenth century) to his son Moroni, who finished and later sealed the record.

Not much is known about the land and hill Cumorah. The only Book of Mormon authors to discuss the location were Mormon and Moroni. Based on a statement given by Mormon, the land of Cumorah was ""a land of many waters, rivers, and fountains"" (Mormon 6:4). Other geographical clues given in the Book of Mormon appear to situate Cumorah north of the narrow neck of land and near an eastern seacoast (cf. Mormon 2:3, 20, 29; Ether 9:3).1, 28–53, esp. 44–53; Matthew P. Roper, ""Plausibility, Probability, and the Cumorah Question,"" Religious Educator 10, no. 2 (2009): 135–158.

Sensing the impending destruction of his people, Mormon records that he concealed the plates of Nephi 1 and all the other records entrusted to him in a hill called Cumorah to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Lamanites (see Book of Mormon Plates and Records). He delivered his own abridgment of these records, called the plates of Mormon, and the small plates of Nephi, which he placed with them, to his son Moroni 2 (W of M 1:5; Morm. 6:6), who continued writing on them before burying them in an unmentioned site more than thirty-six years later (Moro. 10:1-2).

The Book of Mormon mentions a number of separate records that would have been part of Mormon's final record repository in the hill Cumorah. Though the contents of these can be known to us only to the extent that they are summarized or mentioned in the Book of Mormon, Latter-day Saints expect them someday to become available. Alma 2 prophesied to his son Helaman that the brass plates of Laban (the Nephites' version of the Old Testament) would be ""kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord until they should go forth unto every nation"" (Alma 37:4; cf. 1 Ne. 5:17-19). He further explained that ""all the plates"" containing scripture are the ""small and simple"" means by which ""great things are brought to pass"" and by which the Lord will ""show forth his power&#133;unto future generations"" (Alma 37:5-6, 19).",2.0

For example, an entry in Joseph Smith's journal under the date November 20, 1835 indicates the Prophet ""spent the day in translating"" the Egyptian records.2 In an unpublished editorial that was apparently meant to be printed in the March 1, 1842 issue of the *Times and Seasons* (the issue that saw the publication of the first installment of the Book of Abraham), Joseph Smith signaled his desire to ""continue to translate and publish [the text] as fast as possible [until] the whole is completed.""3 What was published with the Book of Abraham was a preface announcing it as ""A TRANSLATION Of some ancient Records that have fallen into our hands . . . purporting to be the writings of Abraham.""4

But while Joseph Smith and others used the word ""translation"" to describe the production of the Book of Abraham, the *means* or *methods* Joseph used to translate ancient scripture were unique. Rather than utilizing dictionaries, grammar books, and lexicons, Joseph translated scripture through revelation. This can be seen in the other efforts Joseph Smith undertook throughout his prophetic ministry to produce other books of scripture.5",3.0

After his disaffection from the Church in 1837, Parrish reported that in his capacity as Joseph's scribe he ""penned down the translation of the Egyptian Hieroglyphicks as [Joseph] claimed to receive it by direct inspiration from Heaven.""20 Parrish's statement, like Whitmer's, emphasizes that the method of Joseph's ""translation of the Egyptian Hieroglyphicks"" was revelatory, not academic, but that the Prophet was still performing a translation of an ancient language.

""One advantage is that in Doctrine and Covenants section 7, Joseph Smith translated an ancient papyrus that he never had in his possession; hence, there is a precedent for Joseph Smith translating a papyrus that was not in his possession, and so there is no reason to suppose that he had to have the papyrus of the Book of Abraham in his possession either.""16 At the same time, however, the main drawback to this theory is that Joseph Smith himself believed that he possessed a physical record of Abraham.17

""Given our current state of knowledge,"" concludes one Latter-day Saint scholar, ""the theory that Joseph Smith translated the Book of Abraham from papyri that we no longer have accounts for the most evidence with the fewest problems. Even so, for none of the theories is the evidence as neat or as compelling as one might wish.""18 It could even be argued that some of these (and other) theories might be combined to form new paradigms. ""As scholars continue to find, research, and analyze the evidence that bears on this subject, future studies will undoubtedly illuminate other theories that have not yet been conceived.""19

Since The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has not taken an official stance on how the translation of the Book of Abraham was accomplished other than by revelation, and since the evidence is not as clear or as complete as we might like, it would perhaps be wiser for readers to worry less about the method of the translation and more about the results.",3.0

As an essay published by the Church recently articulated,

> Joseph's study of the papyri may have led to a revelation about key events and teachings in the life of Abraham, much as he had earlier received a revelation about the life of Moses while studying the Bible. This view assumes a broader definition of the words translator and translation. According to this view, Joseph's translation was not a literal rendering of the papyri as a conventional translation would be. Rather, the physical artifacts provided an occasion for meditation, reflection, and revelation. They catalyzed a process whereby God gave to Joseph Smith a revelation about the life of Abraham, even if that revelation did not directly correlate to the characters on the papyri.14

And so we're so far only talking about the text of the Book of Abraham, but it seems like there's a lot that we don't know, and there's still plenty of room to say that Joseph Smith had these materials, translated either from these materials or was inspired by these materials, that the Book of Abraham comes from God.

Scott Woodward:

Yeah, and that's consistent with his other translation projects, right? Like the Book of Mormon, which was actually written in Reformed Egyptian. By the time Joseph was done translating the Book of Mormon, he still couldn't read Reformed Egyptian. At the end of the day, it came by the gift and power of God. It came by revelation. He got revelation through the use of seer stones, and there was little, if any, actually looking at the text of the Book of Mormon plates, right? He's not running his finger along the hieroglyphs, as far as any eyewitnesses say. He's actually just getting revelation through the instruments that were prepared for that purpose, as he focuses his faith on the plates themselves, right, and asks for revelation to come. So that's the Book of Mormon.

Casey Paul Griffiths:

Yeah. And the same with the Bible. When he translates the Bible, he's not claiming that he has the original manuscripts or that he can see them in vision. He is saying, by the means of the Holy Spirit, I am translating, and that's the word he uses, translating. So all this is consistent. All this is totally consistent.

Scott Woodward:

Belief that he was a real person is shared by others, but the LDS approach is unique: Revelations received by the Prophet Joseph Smith confirm the basic historicity of Genesis and add information echoed in ancient sources, many of which have emerged since his day.

The book of Abraham as restored by Joseph Smith autobiographically recounts Abraham's early life, explaining why he was singled out as the pivotal recipient of divine promises for the blessing of mankind. Not only had he been foreordained in premortal life (Abr. 3:23; cf. *Apocalypse of Abraham* 22:1-5), but as a young man in Ur he opposed idolatry and human sacrifice, ironically turning him into an intended victim (Abr. 1:5-20; cf. *Genesis Rabbah* 38:13). The irony increases when God's last-minute rescue of Abraham foreshadowed what would transpire at Abraham's offering of Isaac.

After marrying Sarah and learning of his lineal right to the patriarchal order of the priesthood as disclosed in the ""records of the fathers"" (Abr. 1:2-4, 26, 31;2:2; *Jubilees* 12:27; cf. D&C 107:40-57), Abraham traveled to Haran, where he apparently received his ordination (Abr. 2:9-11; *WJS*, pp. 245, 303). He also saw the Lord, who gave him remarkable promises: Abraham would be blessed above measure; his posterity would carry the gospel to all nations; and all who received it would bear his name, be accounted his posterity, and bless him as their father (Abr. 2:6-11; cf.

We look at where in Egypt the papyri from which the Book of Abraham was purportedly translated came from, and how Joseph Smith came to possess both this papyri and a couple pair of mummies. We look at the three theories of what source material Joseph Smith translated from and how he did it, and we trace what we know of what happened to the papyri after Joseph's death, how many fragments have survived to this day, and what modern Egyptologists think about those surviving fragments, which is the source of the two biggest controversies about the Book of Abraham.

It gives an account of Christ's visit to the people of this continent. It corroborates and complements the Bible. It establishes the truth of the Bible. The central theme of the Book of Mormon concerns Jesus Christ and his mission. It is for the convincing of the Jews and the gentiles that Jesus is the Christ.

The Book of Mormon is a prophetic book. Its coming forth fulfills many biblical prophecies.

The Book of Mormon was given to the world with the admonition that man should test its authenticity by reading it and asking God if it is true. Before concluding the record of the Nephites, Moroni, the last surviving prophet of these people, wrote to those who would read the record in the latter days:

""When ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.""

""When Joseph Smith began translating the Book of Mormon in 1827, he usually left the plates in a box or wrapped in a cloth, placed the interpreters or his seer stone (both of which seem to have been called Urim and Thummim) in a hat, and read the translation he saw in the stone to a scribe. . . . When the first 116 pages of the Book of Mormon were stolen, an angel took back the interpreters, and Joseph instead used his seer stone.""8 All of this suggests that Joseph Smith's mechanism for translating the Book of Mormon, while still in some way conveying one language (Egyptian) to another (English), was more closely synonymous with revelation.9",3.0

In September of 1823, he was again visited by a heavenly messenger who told him his name was Moroni and that God had a work for Joseph to do.

The angel told him of a book, written upon gold plates, that was deposited in a nearby hill. The plates contained an account of the former inhabitants of the American continent, and also the fulness of the everlasting gospel as delivered by the Savior to those ancient people. Joseph was instructed to visit the spot where the plates were deposited each year for four years. This he did, and on each occasion he was met and instructed by the angel Moroni until finally he was ready to receive and translate the plates.

If any of you are not already familiar with the story of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, I invite you to avail yourselves of the opportunity to do so. Read the book itself, which contains this promise in the last chapter:

""And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

""And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things"" (Moro. 10:4–5).

It is this power which bears witness to hundreds of thousands of converts each year that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that the Book of Mormon is true, that it is a companion book to the Bible and a new and further witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ and a record of his dealings with the early inhabitants of America.",3.0

His first prophetic calling was to bring forth the Book of Mormon. In 1823, at age seventeen, he was shown the hidden record by Moroni, then a resurrected angelic messenger from God (JS-H 1:27-54). After several visitations during the next four years, Joseph was allowed to remove the sacred record from its resting place in the hill Cumorah, near Palmyra, New York. Despite many interruptions and persistent persecutions (JS-H 1:57-60), Joseph Smith translated the lengthy record in about sixty working days. Latter-day Saints bear testimony that he did this ""through the mercy of God, by the power of God"" (D&C 1:29), ""by the inspiration of heaven"" (*Messenger and Advocate* [Oct. 1834]:14-16; JS-H 1:71,n.). He had the assistance of several scribes, chiefly Oliver Cowdery, who wrote what Joseph Smith dictated. The book was published in Palmyra in 1830.

The Book of Mormon both confirms and supplements the Bible: ""Behold, this [the Book of Mormon] is written for the intent that ye may believe that [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe [the Book of Mormon] also"" (Morm. 7:9). The Bible is primarily a record of God's dealings with the forebears and descendants of Jacob or Israel in the ancient Near East. Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of God's dealings principally with another group of Israelites he brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem about 600 B.C. (see Lehi). They anticipated the birth and coming of Jesus Christ and believed in his Atonement and gospel.

The coming forth of the Book of Mormon began long before Joseph Smith received the gold plates from the hands of the angel Moroni.

Book of Mormon Translations

After the Prophet Joseph Smith's original translation of the Book of Mormon from the gold plates into English in 1829 and the return of those plates to the angel Moroni, no translations from English into other languages appeared until the 1850s. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Church produced translations of the Book of Mormon irregularly, often in groups of languages, and at widely separated intervals. However, in the 1970s and later, translations from the English text of the Book of Mormon became systematic and frequent.

Making the Book of Mormon and other Standard Works available in many languages is foreshadowed by the divine injunction ""that every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language"" (D&C 90:11). As missions were opened on the continent of Europe in 1850 and 1851, Church leaders in many of the newly opened missions mounted simultaneous translation efforts. The Danish edition (1851), produced by Erastus Snow for the Scandinavian Mission from a Danish translation by Peter Olsen Hansen, was the first printed (see SCANDINAVIA, THE CHURCH IN). At the same time, John TAYLOR supervised translations into French by Curtis E. Bolton and German by George P. Dykes, while Lorenzo SNOW was working on the Italian edition and John Davis on a Welsh one. All of these appeared in 1852, and culminated with George Q. Cannon's translation of the Book of Mormon into Hawaiian in 1855. No further translations we republished for twenty years.",1.0

Joseph once commented that the book was ""translated into our own language"" (*TPJS*, p. 17; cf. D&C 1:24). In several chapters, for good and useful reasons, this meant that the language would follow the King James idiom of the day (*see CWHN* 8:212-16; Welch, 1990, pp. 134-63). It also assured that the manuscript would contain human misspellings and grammatical oddities, implying that if it had been translated in another decade its phraseology and vocabulary might have been slightly different.

At the same time, circumstantial evidence in the English text suggests that the translation was quite precise. For example, the independent and identical translations of 1 Nephi 1:8 andof Alma 36:22(precisely quoting twenty-one of Lehi's words in 1 Nephi 1:8) typify the internal accuracy manifested in this long and complex record. Moreover, several formulaic terms, Hebraisms, stylistic indications of multiple authorship, varieties of parallelism and extended chiasmus (see Book of Mormon Authorship; Book of Mormon Literature), as well as certain Semitic proper names and some textual variants, not at all evident from the King James Bible, corroborate the claim that the translation was faithful to a consistent underlying text.",1.0

David Whitmer is quoted as saying that ""frequently one character would make two lines of manuscript while others made but a word or two words"" (*Deseret News*, Nov. 10, 1881). Nevertheless, the linguistic relationship between the English translation and the characters on the plates cannot be determined without consulting the Nephite original, which was returned to the angel Moroni in 1829 (see Moroni, Visitations of).Illustration

An introductory statement in the 1921 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants explains that the lectures were deleted because ""they were never presented to nor accepted by the Church as being otherwise than theological lectures or lessons"" (see Doctrine and Covenants Editions). The decision may also have been influenced by what many readers have perceived as conflicts between statements about the Godhead in the fifth lecture and certain later revelations (D&C 130; Dahl and Tate, pp. 16-19). Others have found these conflicts to be more apparent than real and have attempted reconciliations (R. Millet, in Dahl and Tate, pp. 221-40).

The ""Lectures on Faith"" have been published separately from the Doctrine and Covenants for the LDS community four times: in 1840-1843, by Parley P. Pratt in England; in 1940, by compiler N. B. Lundwall in Salt Lake City; in 1985, by Deseret Book Company, Salt Lake City; and in 1990, by the Religious Studies Center at Brigham Young University. They were published separately twice by schismatic groups: in 1845-1846, by Sidney Rigdon (in Pittsburgh, soon after he left the Church); and in 1952, by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The Religious Studies Center publication includes a newly edited version of the lectures designed to make the text more readable. It provides textual comparison charts that identify all textual changes that have occurred in various printings of the lectures from 1835 to 1990. It also contains a summary of historical information, a doctrinal discussion of the topic of each lecture, and an extensive bibliography (Dahl and Tate).",3.0

Williams, who compiled the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, said in the ""Lectures on Faith"" preface ""that it contains, in short, the leading items of the religion which we have professed to believe,"" and ""we have&#133;endeavored to present *our* belief, though in few words, and when we say this, we humbly trust that it is the faith and principles of this society as a body"" (Dahl and Tate, pp. 29-30).

Although it is impossible to evaluate the long-term impact of the lectures on LDS belief and teaching, the process of producing the lectures led early Church leaders to articulate and synthesize some of what they had learned from the revelations of the Restoration with the understanding of the Bible that they inherited from American Christianity. Although these lectures have received limited attention from most Latter-day Saints, others have taken them quite seriously and praised their value. LDS scripturalist and apostle Bruce R. McConkie wrote regarding the lectures, ""They were not themselves classed as revelations, but in them is to be found some of the best lesson material ever prepared on the Godhead; on the character, perfections, and attributes of God; on faith, miracles, and sacrifice. They can be studied with great profit by all gospel scholars"" (*MD*, p. 439). The 1990 republication of the lectures signals the desire of some LDS scholars to stimulate interest in their historical and doctrinal significance for the Church.

Grant assigned a committee of six members of the Council of the Twelve to prepare a new edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. The major change in the 1921 edition was the removal of the ""Lectures on Faith,"" which were not considered to be revelations. The committee also revised the footnotes and divided the pages into double columns. Even though the name of the collection had been changed in the 1835 edition to signal the addition of the ""Lectures on Faith,"" it was not changed back when the lectures were deleted. The 1921 edition was the standard until 1981.

**THE 1981 EDITION.** A committee appointed by the First Presidency of the Church directed the publication of a new edition of the Doctrine and Covenants in 1981. New features included completely revised footnotes and rewritten introductory headings for each section. Two additional sections and a second official declaration were also incorporated. Section 137 is a portion of a vision of the Celestial Kingdom given to Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple on January 21, 1836. Section 138 is a vision about the redemption of the dead given to Joseph F. Smith, sixth President of the Church, in 1918. Official Declaration-2 is the 1978 announcement by the First Presidency that all worthy male members of the Church can be ordained to the priesthood.

**FOREIGN-LANGUAGE EDITIONS.** The Church has also published the Doctrine and Covenants in many languages other than English. Beginning in 1851 with the Welsh edition, the Doctrine and Covenants has been translated and published in its entirety in a score or more languages and selections from it in many others.

In subsequent editions, more sections were added (see Doctrine and Covenants Editions). The most recent additions were sections 137 (1836) and 138 (1918) on salvation of the dead, and the Official Declaration 2 announcing the priesthood available to every worthy male member of the Church (1978). An article on marriage written by Oliver Cowdery in 1835 was deleted from the 1876 edition. Beginning with the 1921 edition, a set of lessons called the Lectures on Faith have not been included.

One hundred of the revelations were received before 1834, during the early, formative years of the Church. Many of them were addressed to specific individuals who sought wisdom from the Prophet. Gospel doctrines were often not revealed in their fulness at first, but were received progressively from time to time. As the Church grew and relocated, questions regarding Church administration, duties of officers, guidance for the members of the Church, and events of the future became the subjects of further revelations.

Not all the revelations received by Joseph Smith are included in the Doctrine and Covenants (see unpublished revelations). Some are contained in the *History of the Church*, giving counsel and instruction to individuals (*HC* 1:229), concerning the Saints being driven to the Rocky Mountains (*HC* 5:85), and a prophecy about Stephen A.

**Lecture One**
1. Faith [is] the first principle in revealed religion, and the foundation of all righteousness.
9. Faith is the assurance which men have of the existence of things which they have not seen and&#133;the principle of action in all intelligent beings.
12. As faith is the moving cause of all action in temporal concerns, so it is in spiritual.
13. But faith is not only the principle of action, but it is also the principle of power in all intelligent beings, whether in heaven or on earth.
15. The principle of power which existed in the bosom of God, by which he framed the worlds, was faith.

**Lecture Two**
55. Let us here observe that after any members of the human family are made acquainted with the important fact that there is a God who has created and does uphold all things, the extent of their knowledge respecting his character and glory will depend upon their diligence and faithfulness in seeking after him, until, like Enoch, the brother of Jared, and Moses, they shall obtain faith in God and power with him to behold him face to face.",3.0

The same source indicates that in January 1835 Joseph was engaged in ""preparing the lectures on theology for publication"" (*HC* 2:180).

Because of our location in time and good record keeping, we are privileged to have an up close and personal view of the production of modern scriptural canon, and as we get into it, it's a bit of a rollercoaster. From its first publication in 1835 to its current version today, the Doctrine and Covenants has undergone major additions, deletions, rearrangements, and textual changes. In today's episode of *Church History Matters*, we'll take a ride through the history of this iterative production of the Doctrine and Covenants, from its earliest 1833 version, known as the Book of Commandments, to its 1835 version, which added new revelations and seven major theological lectures known as the Lectures on Faith, to the 1844 version, which added a few crucial revelations and was the last version most of the branches of the Restoration agreed upon after Joseph's death, to the 1876 version, which contained massive additions and rearranging, to the 1921 version, which decanonized the Lectures on Faith, and finally to the version we use today, which underwent revisions as recently as 2013.

The school was organized to help Church leaders and missionaries ""[qualify] themselves as messengers of Jesus Christ, to be ready to do His will in carrying glad tidings to all that would open their eyes, ears, and hearts,"" by being ""more perfectly instructed in the great things of God"" (*HC* 2:169-70; *see also* Schools of the Prophets).

The lectures address three major themes: ""first, faith itself-what it is; secondly, the object on which it rests; and thirdly, the effects which flow from it"" (Dahl and Tate, p. 31). The first lecture explains what faith is; the second shows how the knowledge of God first came into the world and traces this knowledge from Adam to Abraham; the third and fourth discuss the necessary and unchanging attributes of God; the fifth deals with the nature of God the Father, his son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost; the sixth teaches that acquiring faith unto salvation depends on knowing that one's life is pleasing to God, which knowledge can be obtained only by the willingness to sacrifice all earthly things; and the seventh treats the fruits of faith-perspective, power, and ultimately perfection. In the 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants the seven lectures comprised seventy-four pages.

Renamed the *Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints*, the book was presented to, and accepted by, the members of the Church in an August 1835 conference as the word of God. The change in name to Doctrine and Covenants reflected a change in content. Unlike the Book of Commandments, which contained revelations only, the Doctrine and Covenants was divided into two parts. The new first part consisted of seven theological presentations now known as the Lectures on Faith but then titled ""On the Doctrine of the Church of the Latter Day Saints."" The part including the revelations published previously, the original preface, and a number of new revelations not in the 1833 compilation, were titled ""Part Second, Covenants and Commandments."" The title of the Doctrine and Covenants reflects the subtitles of these two parts.

In preparing the 1835 edition, Joseph Smith and a committee appointed to the task on September 24, 1834 (*HC* 2:165, 243-44) edited the revelations that had formerly appeared in the Book of Commandments. They corrected scribal and printing errors and occasionally clarified the text.

Missionary work was a distinct part of the Savior's mortal ministry. This is also true today. The Savior commanded, ""Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."" (Mark 16:15.) His disciples, especially Paul, proclaimed the gospel message widely in the years following the Savior's crucifixion. In 1831, the Lord revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith, ""The voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated."" (D&C 1:2.)

Today more than 44,000 missionaries are working to fulfill the divine mandate to preach the gospel. They bless the people they teach by acquainting them with the fulness of the restored gospel. They bless themselves by the dramatic growth and maturity that come during a mission. Every worthy young man should go on a mission. Also, worthy young women and couples of the Church can give invaluable service in the mission field. They all serve as the emissaries of the Lord. We thank them most sincerely.",3.0

In response to a call, they have left behind home, family, friends, and school and have gone forward to serve. Those who don't understand ask the question, ""Why do they respond so readily and willingly give so much?""

Our missionaries could well answer in the words of Paul, that peerless missionary of an earlier day: ""For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!""5

The holy scriptures contain no proclamation more relevant, no responsibility more binding, no instruction more direct than the injunction given by the resurrected Lord as He appeared in Galilee to the eleven disciples. Said He:

""All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

""Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

""Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.""6

This divine command, coupled with its glorious promise, is our watchword today, as it was in the meridian of time. Missionary work is an identifying feature of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Always has it been; ever shall it be. As the Prophet Joseph Smith declared, ""After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel.""7

Within two short years, all of the full-time missionaries currently serving in this royal army of God will have concluded their full-time labors and will have returned to their homes and loved ones.

Devoted disciples of Jesus Christ always have been and always will be valiant missionaries. A missionary is a follower of Christ who testifies of Him as the Redeemer and proclaims the truths of His gospel.

The Church of Jesus Christ always has been and always will be a missionary church. The individual members of the Savior's Church have accepted the solemn obligation to assist in fulfilling the divine commission given by the Lord to His Apostles, as recorded in the New Testament:

""Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

""Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen"" (Matthew 28:19–20).

Latter-day Saints take seriously this responsibility to teach all people in all nations about the Lord Jesus Christ and His restored gospel. We believe the same Church founded by the Savior anciently has been reestablished on the earth by Him in the latter days. The doctrine, principles, priesthood authority, ordinances, and covenants of His gospel are found today in His Church.

When we invite you to attend church with us or to learn with the full-time missionaries, we are not trying to sell you a product. As members of the Church, we do not receive prizes or bonus points in a heavenly contest. We are not seeking simply to increase the numerical size of the Church. And most importantly, we are not attempting to coerce you to believe as we do. We are inviting you to hear the restored truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ so you can study, ponder, pray, and come to know for yourself if the things we are sharing with you are true.",3.0

A missionary learns, for example, that God can use him as an instrument to accomplish His work. He can say, as did Ammon, a Book of Mormon missionary, ""This is [a] blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work."" (Alma 26:3.)

A missionary learns that he must be humble and dependent on the Lord. He learns to pray with fervor and sincerity, not only for himself but for others, and to be led and directed by the Spirit.

""Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth."" (2 Ne. 2:8.) Jesus displayed a missionary zeal, a fervent desire that all the children of God enjoy the blessings of his gospel. Isn't it interesting that the last chapter of each of the Gospels contains an appeal from the risen Lord to spread the gospel.

On the wall of the main floor of the Church Office Building in Salt Lake City is a magnificent mural depicting Jesus Christ as a resurrected being standing among his eleven Apostles as he gives them a stirring charge to be missionaries to all the world:

""Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

""Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen."" (Matt. 28:19–20.)

The Apostles who there stood with the Son of God responded to this call with faith, boldness, and power. We read that they were ""all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness."" (Acts 4:31.) They had seen a resurrected being, had eaten with him, had felt his hands and feet. They knew, and knowing, they testified: ""For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard."" (Acts 4:20.)

Does that commission extend to us as his disciples? Perhaps we have not seen, in person, the risen Lord. But the testimony of his chosen witnesses is etched into our hearts by the Holy Spirit. We know, and knowing, we too must testify. Is there any question in the mind of any of us that this is one of the chief responsibilities we enjoy by reason of our membership in his Church? I began with Mormon's declaration, ""I have been called of him to declare his word among his people, that they might have everlasting life."" (3 Ne. 5:13.) Such is the calling of each of us.",3.0

Jesus himself was an apostle through whom God spoke (Heb. 1:2;3:1). The Father sent Jesus, and whoever receives him receives the one who sent him (Mark 9:37; John 8:16-19). As the Father sent him, so Jesus sent his apostles (John 20:21). Initially, they were called from those who ""companied with us [the Twelve] all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us"" (Acts 1:21). The number twelve, associated with the apostles, echoes the number of tribes of Israel whom the apostles are to judge (Matt. 19:28; Luke 22:30). In this connection, they stood as the foundation of the early Christian church (Eph. 2:19-21;4:11-14).

At times, the term embraces more than the Twelve, as is implied both in the phrase ""all the apostles"" (1 Cor. 15:7)-which follows particular mention of ""the Twelve"" by Paul (1 Cor. 15:5)-and in references to persons named as apostles who were known not to be among the Twelve (Acts 14:14; Rom. 16:7). It is probable that by A.D. 54 the Lord's brother James had become one of the Twelve (1 Cor. 15:7; Gal. 1:19). Even so, most New Testament references to apostles refer to members of Jesus' original Twelve or to Paul. They were the guarantors or prime witnesses of Jesus' resurrection, which itself constituted the assurance that he was the expected Messiah and Lord of glory (Acts 1:8-11). In the first century, apostles were traveling witnesses to Jesus' resurrection, sent by him into the world for this purpose (Acts 1:8; cf. Matt. 28:19-20). At the group's core-and the Church's foundation-stood Peter, James, and John, who had been with or near Jesus during critical experiences, including his transfiguration (Mark 9:2-9) and his agony in Gethsemane (Mark 14:32-34).",2.0

That one moment in time changed everything forever. The Savior broke down every barrier that stood in the way of our return to a loving Heavenly Father. In return He asks that we ""go … and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

""Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world"" (Matt. 28:19–20).

A more intimate version of the same message is recorded in the Gospel of John. On the shore of the Sea of Galilee, Jesus asked Peter three times, ""Lovest thou me?"" Each time Peter's reply was the same: ""Thou knowest that I love thee."" And each time the Savior instructed Peter: ""Feed my lambs. … Feed my sheep. … Feed my sheep"" (John 21:15–17).

The Savior's impassioned charge to ""feed [His] sheep"" continues in force today. Like Peter and his brethren of old, the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ today have the charge to take the gospel to all the world. This charge is seldom far from our minds. Every General Authority has the responsibility to be a missionary.

But the Savior was not just talking to the Apostles. He was also talking to every person who has been blessed to hear the gospel and is a member of His Church. In revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord puts it in very simple terms: ""It becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor"" (D&C 88:81).",3.0

Missionaries consider themselves emissaries of the Lord in proclaiming his message.

**WHO ARE CALLED.** In the first generation of the Church, married men frequently were called to be missionaries, and they left wives and families for an indeterminate length of time. In recent decades, the majority of missionaries have been young men and women who serve about two years.

Currently, the Church calls as missionaries, on a voluntary, temporary basis, single men from the ages of nineteen to twenty-six, single women twenty-one years and older, and older married couples with no dependent children. Missionary service is coordinated with military service as required.

Missionaries or their families generally cover the major costs of serving a mission. Missionaries called from developing nations may receive needed financial assistance from the general missionary fund of the Church. This assistance covers only basic living costs, as the Church has no paid ministry. No one is paid for missionary service.",3.0

In that same month, tens of thousands of others were called as officers and teachers and other workers in the many Church organizations throughout the world. Those called in April joined millions of others already serving in similar capacities in the restored Church.

As I contemplated my own calling and the callings of millions of others already in service, I was led to consider this question: Why do we serve?

Service is an imperative for those who worship Jesus Christ. To followers who were vying for prominent positions in his kingdom, the Savior taught, ""Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant."" (Matt. 20:27.) On a later occasion, he spoke of ministering to the needs of the hungry, the naked, the sick, and the imprisoned. He concluded that teaching with these words: ""Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."" (Matt. 25:40.)",2.0

He said, ""I don't want to go."" I asked, ""What has that got to do with it? We need you.""

President Kimball has said we don't have *half enough* missionaries. Can't you see that it doesn't matter whether you want to go or not? You're needed! Do you know what it means to be needed? The bonds of brotherhood are forged deep and strong in the mission field. You will develop a love for a companion with whom you kneel in daily prayer. You will learn to love the people where you serve, no matter what nationality or condition. And they will love you. They will love you because you brought them the gospel.

Converts always remember those who taught them. I've heard many converts speak almost reverently of ""our missionaries."" Imagine having people pray for you. Do you understand what that means? This will always be a purifying and refining influence in your life.

Many people out there are praying for the truth. You are the one who can bring it to them best. At present only 18,000 of you are serving. There are nearly 60,000, 19 through 25, who have not. We need more, many more. Missionary service is not preempted by any other thing. Marriage does not take precedence. Your work does not have priority. Your education is interrupted to fill this calling. College-related activities may be timed to satisfy both school and mission requirements. Some of you may be physically handicapped.

Your moral worthiness is a prime consideration. We want no flabbiness of character when spiritual strength is required. Study! Get some colored pencils. Keep them with your Book of Mormon.

People serve one another for different reasons, and some reasons are better than others. Perhaps none of us serves in every capacity all the time for only a single reason. Since we are imperfect beings, most of us probably serve for a combination of reasons, and the combinations may be different from time to time as we grow spiritually. But we should all strive to serve for the reasons that are highest and best.

What are some of the reasons for service? By way of illustration, and without pretending to be exhaustive, I will suggest six reasons. I will discuss these in ascending order from the lesser to the greater reasons for service.

Some may serve for hope of earthly reward. Such a man or woman might serve in Church positions or in private acts of mercy in an effort to achieve prominence or cultivate contacts that would increase income or aid in acquiring wealth. Others might serve in order to obtain worldly honors, prominence, or power.",0.0

There is far greater flexibility in the service opportunities of couples than for single elders or sisters. In consultation with your bishop, you can indicate your own preferences for missionary service. We must train a growing number of fathers and mothers and priesthood and auxiliary leaders throughout the world who want very much to serve the Lord but simply do not know how to do it. You can help them as a leadership missionary couple. You can serve in temples, family history, educational and medical activities, welfare service projects, public affairs, and visitors' centers. There is a need for almost every discipline of life. There is undoubtedly a need somewhere in the world for your unique capacities and talents. Often special health considerations can be accommodated. The feelings you express to the bishop are communicated in a recommendation for a call. The President of the Church has made it possible for those calls to be inspired of the Lord, taking into consideration your special needs and desires as a couple. Stake presidents and bishops are kept aware of current full-time missionary needs. If you cannot find anyone locally to identify potential missionary opportunities, write to the Missionary Department at headquarters. We will send you a list of the current needs. I encourage each couple with available time to prayerfully consider a full-time mission. You will be greatly blessed for the courage to accept a call.

Some may serve out of fear of punishment. The scriptures abound with descriptions of the miserable state of those who fail to follow the commandments of God.

As you prayerfully seek and cultivate missionary opportunities in your daily activities, you will find many ways to serve. They include helping to find, convert, and retain new members. The stake or full-time missionaries can teach you how to do that.

You can help the full-time and stake missionaries bring new investigators to church and make them feel comfortable. Let them know that they have a new friend. Strengthen that friendship by inviting them to your home or to Church activities with you. You can support them in obeying the commandments. Such valuable missionary service is not difficult because it can be carried out in the normal routine of your daily life.

There are other ways you may not think of as missionary service. For example, a young mother can teach each growing son to prepare to be a missionary to preach the gospel and to share his testimony of truth. As mother and father cultivate that thought throughout his growing years, he will be a missionary. That is excellent missionary service.",2.0

The Savior applied that principle in the Sermon on the Mount, in which he commanded us to love our enemies, bless them that curse us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them that despitefully use us and persecute us. (See Matt. 5:44.) He explained the purpose of that commandment as follows:

""For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?

""And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?"" (Matt. 5:46–47.)

This principle—that our service should be for the love of God and the love of fellowmen rather than for personal advantage or any other lesser motive—is admittedly a high standard. The Savior must have seen it so, since he joined his commandment for selfless and complete love directly with the ideal of perfection. The very next verse of the Sermon on the Mount contains this great commandment: ""Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."" (Matt. 5:48.)

This principle of service is reaffirmed in the fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants:

""Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day."" (D&C 4:2.)

We learn from this command that it is not enough to serve God with all of our *might and strength.* He who looks into our hearts and knows our minds demands more than this. In order to stand blameless before God at the last day, we must also serve him with all our *heart and mind.*

Service with all of our heart and mind is a high challenge for all of us. Such service must be free of selfish ambition. It must be motivated only by the pure love of Christ.",0.0

The message of the Bible is held to be true, while details of accuracy and completeness are accepted within certain limits. The Prophet Joseph Smith explained: ""I believe the Bible as it read when it came from the pen of the original writers. Ignorant translators, careless transcribers, or designing and corrupt priests have committed many errors"" (*TPJS*, p. 327). And again, ""From sundry revelations which had been received, it was apparent that many points touching the salvation of men, had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled"" (*TPJS*, pp. 9-10).

Joseph Smith often used the words ""translated"" and ""translation,"" not in the narrow sense alone of rendering a text from one language into another, but in the wider senses of ""transmission,"" having reference to copying, editing, adding to, taking from, rephrasing, and interpreting. This is substantially beyond the usual meaning of ""translation."" When he said the Bible was not translated correctly, he not only was referring to the difficulties of rendering the Bible into another language but he was also observing that the manuscripts containing the text of the Bible have suffered at the hands of editors, copyists, and revisionists through centuries of transmission.

The translation process was revelatory and educational, and was a means of expanding the Prophet Joseph Smith's knowledge and doctrinal awareness (cf. D&C 45:60-61). The contributions, therefore, go beyond the particular biblical text that may have initiated the process. Among the doctrines of the LDS Church that arose from the JST translation process are the building of Zion, patterned after Enoch's city; the age of accountability of children, with baptism at eight years; the extensive revelation about the degrees of glory and plural marriage (including celestial, eternal marriage); and various items of priesthood organization and responsibility. These and other doctrines were often introduced during the translation process and later developed through subsequent revelations now contained in the Doctrine and Covenants. Revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants received during the translation process are sections 76, 77, 86, and 91, and parts of 107 and 132. In this way the JST has affected the spiritual life of every member of the Church, even though most of the members have not known of the JST.

The tangible product-the printed JST-consists of a Bible with thousands of unique corrections, additions, and readings. Although many Latter-day Saints regard this as the most correct version of the Bible now available, and therefore use it as a valuable source for biblical understanding, the wider contribution has probably been the enlightening effect that the process had upon Joseph Smith and the subsequent revelations through him that have shaped Church doctrine and practice. Most of the doctrinal and organizational revelations that have governed the Church, and that are now published in the Doctrine and Covenants, came to Joseph Smith during the period that he was translating the Bible (1830-1833).",1.0

Joseph Smith was assisted by various scribes. The manuscript shows that Oliver Cowdery was the first, serving between June and October 1830; he recorded an introductory revelation (Moses 1) and the translation of KJV Genesis 1:1to Genesis 4:18. John Whitmer served second, from October until December 1830, recording the translation of KJV Genesis 4:19to approximately Genesis 5:20.

At that time a subtitle, ""Inspired Version,"" was added, although the text remained the same as the 1867 edition. In 1944 a ""New Corrected Edition"" was published by the RLDS Church in which at least 352 verses were amended to correct typographical and judgment errors in the 1867 edition. These corrections were matters of detail, although in a few instances they significantly affected the meaning of the passages and brought the printed text into closer harmony with the manuscript. In 1970 a parallel column edition consisting of the Inspired Version and the King James Version was issued by the RLDS Church publishing house.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has never published the entire Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible. Portions of Genesis and of Matthew, distributed during the time of Joseph Smith in Kirtland and in Nauvoo, are included in the Pearl of Great Price under the title Book of Moses (JST Gen. 1 through 8:18) and Joseph Smith-Matthew (JST Matt. 24). Extensive portions of JST Genesis 1-5 and a single excerpt each from Romans and Hebrews were used in the Lectures on Faith and are still published therein. In 1979 the LDS Church published an edition of the King James Version with hundreds of JST footnotes and a seventeen-page appendix containing JST excerpts (see Bible: LDS Publication of the Bible).",3.0

The vision asserts (1) that the ancient authors wrote under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, (2) that originally their words contained the fulness of the gospel and were plain and easy to understand, but (3) that many things which were plain and precious, and many covenants, would be ""taken away"" from the original manuscripts; as a result, afterward (4) a great many persons, even with a Bible, would not understand the fulness of the gospel, but (5) the lost material would be restored through ""other records"" that the Lord would bring forth (1 Ne. 13:21-41). A somewhat parallel statement came to Joseph Smith in June 1830 while he was restoring a revelation received by Moses, declaring that many things would be taken ""from the book"" which Moses would write, but that the missing information would be restored through another prophet and thus be ""had again"" among those who believe (Moses 1:41). Latter-day Saints believe that the ""other records"" referred to include the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, the JST, and other records still to come forth, and that the prophet divinely raised up to begin restoring the lost material is Joseph Smith (see Scriptures: Forthcoming Scripture). In light of the foregoing statements, it is worth observing that the principal difficulty in the Bible apparently has been omissions. The remaining text may be generally correct in itself, but many important doctrinal items (resulting from the loss of a single word, a verse, a longer passage, or even whole books in some instances) are now missing.",3.0

This appointment can be illustrated by excerpts from his writings. After laboring off and on for ten months on the early chapters of Genesis, Joseph Smith received a revelation from the Lord on March 7, 1831, directing him to begin work on the New Testament: ""It shall not be given unto you to know any further concerning this chapter, until the New Testament be translated, and in it all these things shall be made known; wherefore I give unto you that ye may now translate it"" (D&C 45:60-61). The manuscript of the JST shows that Joseph Smith began the translation of Matthew the next day. On December 1, 1831, the Prophet entered the following in his journal: ""I resumed the translation of the Scriptures, and continued to labor in this branch of my calling with Elder Sidney Rigdon as my scribe"" (*HC* 1:238-39). On February 16, 1832, he reported a revelation concerning the resurrection of the dead that includes the following reference to his divine commission to translate: ""For while we [Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon] were doing the work of translation, which the Lord had appointed unto us, we came to the twenty-ninth verse of the fifth chapter of John"" (D&C 76:15). On March 8, 1833, he reported the word of the Lord to him as follows: ""And when you have finished the translation of the [Old Testament] prophets, you shall from thenceforth preside over the affairs of the church"" (D&C 90:13). On May 6, 1833, Joseph Smith reported the following revelation: ""It is my will that you should hasten to translate my scriptures"" (D&C 93:53). Although not a complete list, the foregoing items illustrate Joseph Smith's claim to a divine appointment to translate the Old and New Testaments.",2.0

Joseph once commented that the book was ""translated into our own language"" (*TPJS*, p. 17; cf. D&C 1:24). In several chapters, for good and useful reasons, this meant that the language would follow the King James idiom of the day (*see CWHN* 8:212-16; Welch, 1990, pp. 134-63). It also assured that the manuscript would contain human misspellings and grammatical oddities, implying that if it had been translated in another decade its phraseology and vocabulary might have been slightly different.

At the same time, circumstantial evidence in the English text suggests that the translation was quite precise. For example, the independent and identical translations of 1 Nephi 1:8 andof Alma 36:22(precisely quoting twenty-one of Lehi's words in 1 Nephi 1:8) typify the internal accuracy manifested in this long and complex record. Moreover, several formulaic terms, Hebraisms, stylistic indications of multiple authorship, varieties of parallelism and extended chiasmus (see Book of Mormon Authorship; Book of Mormon Literature), as well as certain Semitic proper names and some textual variants, not at all evident from the King James Bible, corroborate the claim that the translation was faithful to a consistent underlying text.",1.0

Little is known about the translation process itself. Few details can be gleaned from comments made by Joseph's scribes and close associates. Only Joseph Smith knew the actual process, and he declined to describe it in public. At a Church conference in 1831, Hyrum Smith invited the Prophet to explain more fully how the Book of Mormon came forth.

""When Joseph Smith began translating the Book of Mormon in 1827, he usually left the plates in a box or wrapped in a cloth, placed the interpreters or his seer stone (both of which seem to have been called Urim and Thummim) in a hat, and read the translation he saw in the stone to a scribe. . . . When the first 116 pages of the Book of Mormon were stolen, an angel took back the interpreters, and Joseph instead used his seer stone.""8 All of this suggests that Joseph Smith's mechanism for translating the Book of Mormon, while still in some way conveying one language (Egyptian) to another (English), was more closely synonymous with revelation.9",3.0

For example, an entry in Joseph Smith's journal under the date November 20, 1835 indicates the Prophet ""spent the day in translating"" the Egyptian records.2 In an unpublished editorial that was apparently meant to be printed in the March 1, 1842 issue of the *Times and Seasons* (the issue that saw the publication of the first installment of the Book of Abraham), Joseph Smith signaled his desire to ""continue to translate and publish [the text] as fast as possible [until] the whole is completed.""3 What was published with the Book of Abraham was a preface announcing it as ""A TRANSLATION Of some ancient Records that have fallen into our hands . . . purporting to be the writings of Abraham.""4

But while Joseph Smith and others used the word ""translation"" to describe the production of the Book of Abraham, the *means* or *methods* Joseph used to translate ancient scripture were unique. Rather than utilizing dictionaries, grammar books, and lexicons, Joseph translated scripture through revelation. This can be seen in the other efforts Joseph Smith undertook throughout his prophetic ministry to produce other books of scripture.5",2.0

When Sidney Rigdon began serving as a scribe, however, he apparently persuaded Joseph to change his practice and mark only passages in the Bible that needed changes and record those.""16 Even though Joseph and his clerks were revising the English text of the KJV and sometimes revealing entirely new content (such as portions of what is today called the Book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price),17 they nevertheless called the project a translation. While it is arguable that a handful of Joseph Smith's revisions to the KJV Bible are indeed more precise renderings of the underlying Greek and Hebrew, or that the larger portions revealed by the Prophet in some way correspond to now-lost ancient manuscripts, this once again indicates the broad range of meaning the Prophet applied to this term.",1.0

That was almost 35 years ago, and little did I know at the time that I would spend several years of my ministry in the Seventy in the Africa West Area of the Church, among a believing, faithful people whose lives would be so affected by the 1978 revelation on priesthood. Sister Dickson and I have lived there for four years, and the experience has been wonderful and life changing for us.

As a people, West Africans believe in God, have absolutely no shame in declaring and sharing their belief with others, and have tremendous leadership capacity.

In the meantime, however, he was content to gently work on what you've called the peripheries. You know, pouring out his spirit upon thousands in Africa, in spite of the ban; working through patriarchs to give seemingly impossible blessings; working, no doubt, through the Civil Rights movement; prodding Lester Bush's scholarship; guiding church leaders to build a temple in Brazil—all things that eventually converge to persuade the apostles to keenly feel a need to draw near unto the Lord on this issue so that he could draw near unto them. So I guess this history helps me understand that prophetic fallibility is always tempered with both the mercy and the wisdom of God. Like, the good news for those who made mistakes is that God is merciful, and he forgives. And the good news for the innocent and faithful who were hurt by those mistakes is that when the Lord is involved, nothing can ever go permanently wrong. Working within the constraints of man's agency, the Lord eventually got us back on course, right? I love this quote from Paul Reeve in his *Let's Talk About* book that we've been recommending. He said, ""In June 1978, President Spencer W. Kimball received a revelation that returned the church to its universal roots and restored what was lost, priesthood and temple admission to people of African descent. This did not mark something new as much as it reestablished a commitment to the founding principles of the Restoration."" So this is kind of, like, a mini Restoration, right? It's a restoration back to what was originally intended. I like that.",2.0

This ""priesthood revelation"" made it possible for all worthy males to be ordained to all levels of the priesthood. Previously black members of the Church had been denied the priesthood, which precluded their holding priesthood callings and participation in most temple ordinances.

The revelation was received by President Spencer W. Kimball ""after extended meditation and prayer"" in the Salt Lake Temple. That same revelation came to his counselors and to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the temple, and then it was presented to all of the other General Authorities, who approved it unanimously. It was announced by letter to all priesthood officers of the Church and to the press on June 8, 1978. Declaration 2 contains the text of that letter and records its presentation and acceptance on September 30, 1978, in General Conference by the common consent of the members of the Church. The revelation resolved problems for many members who had agonized over the prior practice (Bush and Mauss), the historical origins and ramifications of which had become the subject of considerable debate and reflection.

Since the announcement, missionaries have actively proselytized in many nations with large black populations, where thousands have become members of the Church. Dallin H. Oaks, an apostle, noted this growth in the LDS Afro-American Symposium held at Brigham Young University on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the revelation (Oaks). In particular, he pointed to the rapid growth in black converts in the Caribbean islands, West Africa, and Brazil.

Now Elder Christofferson may wonder, as I did, why one such as I should be ordained to the holy apostleship.

There are many qualifications that I lack. There is so much in my effort to serve that is wanting. There is only one single thing, one qualification that can explain it. Like Peter and all of those who have since been ordained, I have *that* witness.

I know that God is our Father. He introduced His Son, Jesus Christ, to Joseph Smith. I declare to you that I know that Jesus is the Christ. I know that He lives. He was born in the meridian of time. He taught His gospel and was tried. He suffered and was crucified and resurrected on the third day. He, like His Father, has a body of flesh and bone. He made His Atonement. Of Him I bear witness.

Another example of revelation received but not published is the revelation underlying the announcement by the First Presidency in June 1978 extending the priesthood to all worthy male members of the Church. Only an official statement concerning that revelation was published (see Doctrine and Covenants: Official Declaration 2). Other changes in the Church, such as the recent expanding of the role of the seventy, accelerating temple building, and expanding missionary activity, are viewed by Latter-day Saints as manifestations of divine direction. The revealed basis of these changes is not always published, as it more often was in the early years of the Church. As Elder James E.

And there's disunity among the Twelve, in many regards, to this issue with blacks, some about the Civil Rights movement itself, and certainly about the policy barring blacks from priesthood and temple privileges. So we compared and contrasted, for instance, Hugh B. Brown, who was very pro-Civil-Rights-movement, with Ezra Taft Benson, who felt like this was maybe a communist ploy to try to infiltrate America. Hugh B. Brown thought that the priesthood ban was simply a policy that could be changed by vote, and so he actually put it to the Twelve to have them vote, and then Harold B. Lee really pushed strongly back against that. He wasn't in the meeting. When he found out about it, he pushed back and said, ""Listen, this is a doctrine. This is not a policy. This is a doctrine from the beginning. You can't just vote on it. This would take a revelation from heaven."" And so we have this—different apostles seeing this differently, not seeing eye to eye. And so when President Kimball becomes president—I think we ended our last episode with him becoming president in 1973, that at the beginning of his presidency he wrote to his son Edward, saying, ""Revelations will probably never come unless they're desired."" You've got to want the revelation. And he said, ""I believe most revelations will come when a man is on his tiptoes, reaching as high as he can for something which he knows he needs, and then there bursts upon him the answer to his problems."" So today we want to talk about that. What does President Kimball do to begin reaching for a revelation, which we know comes on June 1, 1978, at least to the whole First Presidency and Twelve.

Samuel Smith was an industrious farmer and a Nauvoo city alderman, among other things. Joseph Smith, Sr., was both financially devasted by the fall of the Kirtland Safety Society and in declining health for several years before he passed, so it's entirely possible that the Church did support him financially for a time. But, whether true or not, I personally suspect that Joseph being their family member had a lot more to do with them supporting his calling as a prophet than anything else did.

Emily recalls:",3,"You see, Emma didn't just freeze them out and make them so uncomfortable that they moved out. She tried to drive them entirely out of Nauvoo. *Emily explained:*

*Emma was present [at the sealing of Emily and Eliza]. She gave her free and full consent. She had always up to this time, been very kind to me and my sister Eliza, who was also married to the Prophet Joseph Smith with Emma's consent; but ever after she was our enemy. She used every means in her power to injure us in the eyes of her husband, and before strangers, and in consequence of her abuse we were obliged to leave the city to gratify her, but things were overruled otherwise, and we remained in Nauvoo. My sister Eliza found a home with the family of Brother Joseph Coolidge, and I went to live with Sister Sylvia Lyons. She was a good woman, and one of the Lord's chosen few.*

Emma's hurt and anger over plural marriage are well known. There are multiple stories of her losing her temper and causing scenes and even physical harm to others. These stories led to a strong resentment against her from the Saints who crossed the plains to Utah, which unfortunately lasted for generations. I've noticed a shift in attitude toward her even in my lifetime, which means it hung on for 150 years.

I have a lot of respect and admiration for Emma Smith, and I don't want to spread gossip or add any fuel to the fire against her. I think it's perfectly understandable that she grappled with the principle of plural marriage. I can't imagine being asked to live that law on top of everything else she'd gone through because of Joseph's calling. It would probably be the most difficult thing any of us were ever asked to do. But I do need to discuss some of those stories because they provide important context for Joseph's behavior in these instances I'm covering today.",3.0

To Latter-day Saints around the world, Emma is the most famous woman in the Church. She was the first to know that Joseph received the gold plates from the angel Moroni. She was the only woman to serve as a scribe for the Book of Mormon translation. Of her role as scribe Emma said,

>
> My belief is that the Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity—I have not the slightest doubt of it. I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscript unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe [he] would dictate to me hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he could at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him. This was an unusual thing for him to do. It would have been improbable that a learned man could do this; and, for one so ignorant and unlearned as he was[,] it was simply impossible.3

Many were the re-vibrations of my mind when I contemplated for a moment the many scenes we had been called to pass through.

Emily recalls:",6,"So, the Saints thought she had stayed behind and become wealthy while denying polygamy, while many of them lost everything they had, including family members, during the arduous journey to the Salt Lake Valley. Even once they arrived, they didn't have peace. The US government sent the army out to eradicate them. They were mocked and insulted all over the world. They had their rights to due process and to have representation in government taken from them. The female right to vote was rescinded in their territory. The government seized their property and refused Latter-day Saint immigrants entry into the country. Apostles were murdered. Etc.

The Saints in Utah territory did not have an easy time for well over half a century, sacrificing all that they had to live the commandment of plural marriage. During that time, they believed that Emma was living a very easy life back in Nauvoo because she denied its existence and kept their property for herself. They resented her for that, and unfortunately, it came out in the form of malicious gossip.

They were wrong, just like she was wrong in thinking *they* had the bulk of Joseph's property with them. But that means that it's difficult today to tell which of the later accounts are true and which are false.

From these accounts, however, I think it's clear why Joseph tried to hide some of his plural marriages from Emma. She was very hurt and upset by them, they caused a lot of strife and acrimony in *their* marriage, and she struggled to accept the doctrine. He didn't want to cause her pain, and he didn't want to start any more arguments when their marriage was already in a precarious position. But at the same time, he had to obey God. He had to be sealed to the women he was commanded to be sealed to. It maybe wasn't the *best*decision he could have made, but I don't blame him for making it. And I don't blame her for feeling the way she did about it all.

Emma felt a special guardianship over the new translation materials, saying they ""had been placed in her charge.""5

Emma initially refused to join any group vying for leadership of the Church. In the months following Joseph's martyrdom, Brigham Young and the Quorum of the Twelve emerged as the most prominent leaders of the Church, especially because Joseph had rolled the authority of leadership onto the Twelve three months before his death.6: 5–19.

Most of the Saints had left Nauvoo by the time of the marriage, but Almon Babbitt, a Church leader left behind in Nauvoo to oversee Church interests, confronted Emma, accosting her about her decision to marry outside of the faith.10 Emma and Lewis never had children together, but he acted as a surrogate father to the Smith children. This and many other factors continued to widen the rift in the years following.

In poor health and crippled by arthritis, Lucy depended on the support of Emma and of her own daughters Katherine, Sophronia, and Lucy, who also remained in the area for the rest of their lives.17."") Lucy later spoke tenderly of Emma's care for her, noting that on one occasion ""for five nights Emma never left me; but stood at my bedside all the night long.""18

Finally, Emma had endured terrible trials and saw Nauvoo as a safe haven for her family after Joseph's death. On one occasion she wrote to Joseph III saying of Nauvoo, ""It is my home, and my children's home, and I shall not cease to pray that they all may live to enjoy it.""19 Emma was visited a number of times by members of the Church from Utah.

During the Missouri persecutions of 1838–1839, Emma was forced to flee from that state with her children while Joseph Smith languished in Liberty Jail. Lucy Mack Smith, the mother of the Prophet, recorded this tribute to Emma:

> I have never seen a woman in my life, who would endure every species of fatigue and hardship, from month to month, and from year to year, with that unflinching courage, zeal and patience, which she has always done. … She has breasted the storm of persecution, and buffeted the rage of men and devils, until she has been swallowed up in a sea of trouble which [would] have borne down almost any other woman.1

After Joseph Smith's death in 1844, Emma remained in Nauvoo for the rest of her life rather than traveling on with the Saints, and for several years she did not associate herself with any of the groups linked to the Restoration. Why did Emma stay in Nauvoo after Joseph's death?

Emma was devastated at the death of Joseph Smith. According to one witness, when she saw Joseph's body, she spoke softly to him, saying, ""Oh, Joseph, Joseph! My husband, my husband! Have they taken you from me at last!""2, 197."") At the time of Joseph's death, Emma was pregnant with their last child and left to care for four young children alone. Going anywhere would have been extremely difficult. She was also left without much financial support, and she worried about how she could provide for her family (although in Nauvoo, she had a substantial home and considerable property). Legal claims regarding Joseph's estate and Emma's legal rights as Joseph's widow remained to be sorted out—a process that would take over eight years to complete.3."")",2.0

She shared the Nauvoo House, her final home, with relatives and friends and basked in the love and care of her children and grandchildren. She continued to live her life with genteel qualities, meeting adversity and difficulty with grace and equanimity. She was polite to the ""Utah Mormons"" who occasionally visited, but was firm in her decision to remain apart from them.

Though Emma was publicly criticized by Church leaders for her failure to remain faithful to her husband's mission, she was sympathetically remembered by some of her former Nauvoo friends. Many of them, unlike Emma, had found the courage to accept the doctrine of plural marriage. ""I know it was hard for Emma, and any woman to enter plural marriage in those days,"" wrote Emily Partridge Young, a plural wife, ""and I do not know as anybody would have done any better than Emma did under the circumstances"" (*Woman's Exponent* 12 [Apr. 1, 1884]:165).

In 1892 at the jubilee celebration in Salt Lake City of the founding of the Nauvoo Relief Society, a motion to hang a life-size portrait of Emma Smith in the Tabernacle brought mixed responses from the Relief Society board members. To settle the question, Relief Society president Zina D. H. Young took the matter to Church President Wilford Woodruff, who replied that ""anyone who opposed it [hanging the portrait in the Tabernacle] must be very narrow minded indeed"" (Emmeline B. Wells Diary, March 11, 1892, HDC). Fifty years had softened bitter memories, and Emma Smith could once again be honored as a leader of women and remembered for the essential part she had played in the restoration of the gospel and the support she gave her Prophet-husband through the difficult years of his ministry.

Hmm. Thank you. Another question. This is from a listener named Rich, also about Emma.

We know her son was out here denying his father ever taught the doctrine, but what did Emma ever say on the subject afterwards?""

First, we can immerse ourselves more completely into Jesus's life, His teachings, His majesty, His power, and His atoning sacrifice. The Savior said, ""Look unto me in every thought.""14 The Apostle John reminds us, ""We love him, because he first loved us.""15 As we better experience His love, we love Him even more and, very naturally, better follow His example of loving and caring for those around us. With every righteous movement toward Him, we see Him more clearly.16 We adore Him, and we try in our small ways to emulate Him.17",3.0

Challenges, controversies, and complexities swirl around us. These turbulent times were foreseen by the Savior. He warned us that in our day the adversary would stir up anger in the hearts of men and lead them astray.1 Yet our Heavenly Father never intended that we would deal with the maze of personal problems and social issues on our own.

God so loved the world that He sent His Only Begotten Son2 to help us.3 And His Son, Jesus Christ, gave His life for us. All so that we could have access to godly power—power sufficient to deal with the burdens, obstacles, and temptations of our day.4 Today I would like to speak about *how* we can draw into our lives the power of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ.

We begin by learning about Him.5 ""It is impossible for [us] to be saved in ignorance.""6 The more we know about the Savior's ministry and mission7—the more we understand His doctrine8 and what He did for us—the more we know that He can provide the power that we need for our lives.",2.0

When you heard the scripture I just recited, you heard the words of Christ. I testify that is true. Jesus Christ speaks the words of the Father. You can read the scriptures, listen, and then hear God's answers to you.

There is another way to listen to God. Many of you will have heard answers to your prayers today. I bear testimony that you have in this conference heard the voices of Apostles and prophets of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord said this of them, as they speak by his direction:

""What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.

""For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, and the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever. Amen."" (D&C 1:38–39.)

It is the Spirit which will bear record to your heart as you read the scriptures, as you hear the Lord's authorized servants, and as God speaks directly to your heart. You can listen and hear if you believe that the scriptures are accurate when they describe the Holy Ghost this way:

""Yea, thus saith the still small voice, which whispereth through and pierceth all things, and often times it maketh my bones to quake while it maketh manifest."" (D&C 85:6.)

Now, I testify it is a small voice. It whispers, not shouts. And so you must be very quiet inside. That is why you may wisely fast when you want to listen. And that is why you will listen best when you feel, ""Father, thy will, not mine, be done."" You will have a feeling of ""I want what you want."" Then, the still small voice will seem as if it pierces you. It may make your bones to quake. More often it will make your heart burn within you, again softly, but with a burning which will lift and reassure.",1.0

Modern scriptures are replete with the same invitation. It is an urgent, pleading call to everyone. Indeed, the calm but urgent appeal is still from the Son of God himself. He is, in fact, the Anointed One who will lift the greatest of burdens from the most heavily laden. The conditions for obtaining that assistance are still precisely the same. We must come unto him and take his yoke upon us. In meekness and lowliness, we must learn of him in order to receive eternal life and exaltation.

May we do so in appreciation for the loving gift of eternal joy he offers us I pray—as I leave with you my personal witness that God our Heavenly Father lives and that Jesus is the Christ, having suffered and given his life that we may have life everlasting—in his holy name, amen.",3.0

But I can promise you that the Savior will draw close to you and bless you and your family with what is best. You will have the comfort of His love and feel the answer of His drawing closer as you reach out your arms in giving service to others. As you bind up the wounds of those in need and offer the cleansing of His Atonement to those who sorrow in sin, the Lord's power will sustain you. His arms are outstretched with yours to succor and bless the children of our Heavenly Father, including those in your family.

There is a glorious homecoming prepared for us. We will then see fulfilled the promise of the Lord we have loved. It is He who welcomes us into eternal life with Him and our Heavenly Father. Jesus Christ described it this way:

""Seek to bring forth and establish my Zion. Keep my commandments in all things.

""And, if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.""15

""For those that live shall inherit the earth, and those that die shall rest from all their labors, and their works shall follow them; and they shall receive a crown in the mansions of my Father, which I have prepared for them.""16",3.0

Then He taught His disciples to pray. And today He teaches you and me to pray as we see Him in our minds praying in Gethsemane and saying, ""Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done"" (Luke 22:42). When you pray, do you really, truly want that ""not my will, but thine, be done""?

Paul describes how Jesus prayed ""in the days of his flesh,"" especially in Gethsemane: ""When he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared"" (Hebrews 5:7). When you pray, are you really praying or just saying prayers? Are you superficial with your prayers?

Jesus prayed intensely and spoke with His Father. ""It came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened"" (Luke 3:21). When you pray, do you feel like heaven is opened? When was the last time you felt that connection with heaven?

Jesus prepared Himself to make important decisions by praying to His Father.

""He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.

""And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve"" (Luke 6:12–13).

Do you prepare yourself to make important decisions by praying to your Heavenly Father? Do you prepare yourself for a moment of prayer?",3.0

I gave that challenge because I had already accepted it myself. I read and underlined *every* verse cited about Jesus Christ, as listed under the main heading and the 57 subtitles in the Topical Guide.11 When I finished that exciting exercise, my wife asked me what impact it had on me. I told her, ""I am a different man!""

I felt a renewed devotion to Him as I read again in the Book of Mormon the Savior's own statement about His mission in mortality. He declared:

""I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.

""And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross.""12

As Latter-day Saints, we refer to His mission as the Atonement of Jesus Christ, which made resurrection a reality for all and made eternal life possible for those who repent of their sins and receive and keep essential ordinances and covenants.

It is doctrinally incomplete to speak of the Lord's atoning sacrifice by shortcut phrases, such as ""the Atonement"" or ""the enabling power of the Atonement"" or ""applying the Atonement"" or ""being strengthened by the Atonement."" These expressions present a real risk of misdirecting faith by treating the *event* as if *it* had living existence and capabilities independent of our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.",3.0

This faithful, focused woman needed to stretch as far as she could to access His power. Her physical stretching was symbolic of her spiritual stretching.

Many of us have cried out from the depths of our hearts a variation of this woman's words: ""If I could spiritually stretch enough to draw the Savior's power into my life, I would know how to handle my heart-wrenching situation. I would know what to do. And I would have the power to do it.""

When you reach up for the Lord's power in your life with the same intensity that a drowning person has when grasping and gasping for air, power from Jesus Christ will be yours. When the Savior knows you truly want to reach up to Him—when He can feel that the greatest desire of your heart is to draw His power into your life—you will be led by the Holy Ghost to know exactly what you should do.21

When you spiritually stretch beyond anything you have ever done before, then His power will flow into you.22 And then you will understand the deep meaning of words we sing in the hymn ""The Spirit of God"":

The Lord is extending the Saints' understanding. …

The knowledge and power of God are expanding;

The veil o'er the earth is beginning to burst.23

The gospel of Jesus Christ is filled with His power, which is available to every earnestly seeking daughter or son of God. It is my testimony that when we draw His power into our lives, both He and we will rejoice.24

As one of His special witnesses, I declare that God lives! Jesus is the Christ! His Church has been restored to the earth! God's prophet upon the earth today is President Thomas S. Monson, whom I sustain with all my heart. I so testify, with my expression of love and blessing for each of you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",3.0

There is no amorphous entity called ""the Atonement"" upon which we may call for succor, healing, forgiveness, or power. Jesus Christ is the source. Sacred terms such as *Atonement* and *Resurrection* describe what the Savior did, according to the Father's plan, so that we may live with hope in this life and gain eternal life in the world to come.

The lyrics go something like this:

When Christmas morning gleams

I want to go to the stable,

Where God in the nighttime hours

Already rests upon the straw.

How good Thou wast to desire

To come down to the earth!

Now, I do not wish to waste

My childhood days in sin anymore!

Jesus, we need Thee,

Thou dear children's friend.

I no longer wish to grieve Thee

With my sins again.10

When we figuratively transport ourselves to the Bethlehem stable, ""where God in the nighttime hours already rests upon the straw,"" we can recognize better the Savior as a gift from a kind, loving Heavenly Father. Rather than feeling entitled to His blessings and grace, we develop an intense desire to stop causing God further grief.

Whatever our current direction or distance to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, we can choose to turn toward Them and draw closer to Them. They will help us. As the Savior told the Nephites following His Resurrection:

""And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, …

""And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me.""11

To draw closer to the Savior, we must increase our faith in Him, make and keep covenants, and have the Holy Ghost with us. We must also act in faith, responding to the spiritual direction we receive. All of these elements come together in the sacrament. Indeed, the best way I know of to draw closer to God is to prepare conscientiously and partake worthily of the sacrament each week.",1.0

We realize that as evil increases in the world, our spiritual survival, and the spiritual survival of those we love, will require that we more fully nurture, fortify, and strengthen the roots of our faith in Jesus Christ. The Apostle Paul counseled us to be rooted,9 grounded, and settled10 in our love for the Savior and our determination to follow Him. Today and the days ahead require more focused and concentrated effort, guarding against diversions and carelessness.11

But even with the increasing worldly influences around us, we need not fear. The Lord will never desert His covenant people. There is a compensatory power of spiritual gifts and divine direction for the righteous.12 This added blessing of spiritual power, however, does not settle upon us just because we are part of this generation. It comes as we strengthen our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and keep His commandments, as we come to know Him and love Him. ""This is life eternal,"" Jesus prayed, ""that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.""13

As we know very well, having faith in Jesus Christ and being a true disciple is more than a one-time decision—more than a one-time event. It is a sacred, ongoing process that grows and expands through the seasons of our lives, continuing until we kneel at His feet.

With the wheat growing amidst the tares in the world, how can we deepen and strengthen our commitment to the Savior in the days ahead?

Nephi said, the Lord ""hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh"" (2 Ne. 4:21). Those who are consumed in Christ ""are made alive in Christ"" (2 Ne. 25:25). They ""suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ"" (Alma 31:38). They are ""clasped in the arms of Jesus"" (Morm. 5:11). Nephi said, ""I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul"" (2 Ne. 33:6). Lehi said, ""I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his love"" (2 Ne. 1:15).

Now, my beloved brethren and sisters, let us read the Book of Mormon and be convinced that Jesus is the Christ. Let us continually reread the Book of Mormon so that we might more fully come to Christ, be committed to Him, centered in Him, and consumed in Him.

We are meeting the adversary every day. The challenges of this era will rival any of the past, and these challenges will increase both spiritually and temporally. We must be close to Christ, we must daily take His name upon us, always remember Him, and keep His commandments.",2.0

(""Jesus Christ—Gifts and Expectations,"" in *Speeches of the Year, 1974,* Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1975, p. 313.)

While what President Benson said will be true in the future, we need to feel now that God knows us and loves us as individuals. There are times you have felt the closeness of God, your Father, and that you are his child. Those times can come more often. There is a simple way to think about it.

If you want to stay close to someone who has been dear to you, but from whom you are separated, you know how to do it. You would find a way to speak to them, you would listen to them, and you would discover ways to do things for each other. The more often that happened, the longer it went on, the deeper would be the bond of affection. If much time passed without the speaking, the listening, and the doing, the bond would weaken.

God is perfect and omnipotent, and you and I are mortal. But he is our Father, he loves us, and he offers the same opportunity to draw closer to him as would a loving friend. And you will do it in much the same way: speaking, listening, and doing.

Our Heavenly Father has not only invited us to speak to him, he has commanded it. And, as he has always done, when he commands, he promises, too.",2.0

President Thomas S. Monson has reminded us often of the promise of the Lord to His faithful disciples: ""And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.""12

There is another way you and I have felt Him grow closer to us. As we give devoted service to Him, He draws closer to those we love in our families. Every time I have been called in the Lord's service to move or to leave my family, I have come to see that the Lord was blessing my wife and my children. He prepared loving servants of His and opportunities to draw my family closer to Him.

You have felt that same blessing in your lives. Many of you have loved ones who are wandering off the path to eternal life. You wonder what more you can do to bring them back. You can depend on the Lord to draw closer to them as you serve Him in faith.

In general conferences of the Church, the most frequently cited scriptures from the book of Hebrews are those concerning the Godhead (Heb. 1:1-3;12:9;13:8); the obedient suffering of Jesus (Heb. 2:14-18;4:15-16;5:8-9; *see also* Atonement of Jesus Christ); the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ (Heb. 7-8); how one must be called by God in order to hold the priesthood (Heb. 5:1-4); the nature of true faith, which motivates people to righteous action (Heb. 11); going on ""unto perfection"" (Heb. 6:1); and enduring to the end (Heb. 12:4-11). These themes are essential pillars of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

The main point at the center of the epistle is that Jesus Christ is the eternal ""high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle"" of God (Heb. 8:1-2). This theme is developed throughout the epistle, showing how eternal salvation comes through the greatness, sufficiency, and supremacy of Jesus Christ. The letter was written to devoted converts from Judaism to the early Christian church, who already understood the first principles of the gospel and had received its basic ordinances (Heb. 6:1-4). Step by step, it systematically strives to persuade them ""to hold fast to their faith"" (Buchanan, p. 266), to keep the covenant, and to realize the incomparable hope and irrevocable promises given to them by God through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. With its explication of the Atonement in terms of priesthood, oaths, covenants, and temple imagery, this entire epistle resonates and harmonizes with LDS concepts and practices.",1.0

As a separate and distinct personage in the Godhead, he is the God of creation and the perfect revelation of godhood for all time. He is the express image of his Father, both spiritually and physically; he alone purged the sins of mankind and sits on the right hand of God the Father (Heb. 1:1-3). The Father brought the Savior (who was his ""firstbegotten"" in the premortal existence) ""into the world"" (Heb. 1:6; cf. D&C 93:21; 1 Ne. 11:18). As the firstborn, Jesus is the heir of all things (Heb. 1:2), and those who are faithful become joint-heirs with him (see Heirs).

Chapter 2 holds a strong warning to heed the word of God given through Jesus Christ (Heb. 2:1-4). The next world is in subjugation to Christ alone (Heb 2:5-10). God made him a little lower than ""the gods"" (taking the marginal reading of Ps. 8:4-6). Because God is the Father of all, even Christ is subject to him. Christ is second only to the Father, yet he is the spirit brother of mankind (Heb. 2:17). Like his brothers and sisters in mortality, he suffered temptation, but unlike them, he never sinned (Heb. 2:18;4:15-16).

And so when he's now not with them, and we had all those other epistles where he's trying to correct and fix contention and disorder, it's lovely that we now have what may have been a common sermon from Paul about how people can understand Jesus Christ—things that we don't typically get in other Pauline writings because he's trying to address specific issues in different words around the Mediterranean Basin who've already received this message.

And by the way, just as another side note on the Paul point. If you're Paul and you're trying to convince judaizers of the supremacy of Christ and you want to persuade people and move the needle, per se, you probably don't want to introduce yourself and you probably want to get somebody who's really good with the Greek, so that people can't tell it's you giving the message because Paul isn't the most popular. He would not have won the congeniality competitions among the judaizers. They don't exactly love Paul.

This—if you've ever been in a situation where you feel kind of giddy, you're so excited with anticipation, that's how we feel getting ready to jump into this epistle to the Hebrews. It is loaded. It is one of my favorite books in the New Testament. And let me just, let me begin with a 30,000 foot overview of what the epistle to the Hebrews is. You ready? That's it. The greater than sign. That's it. The entire book, what it's showing is that Jesus Christ is greater than or superior to everything that the recipients of this letter hold near and dear to their hearts. The Hebrews—we don't know where these people are living specifically. We don't know exactly when this epistle was written. We don't even know who specifically wrote it. It says ""The Epistle Paul the Apostle.""

But you'll notice, it's one of the longer epistles of all of them contained in the New Testament, and yet it comes after Philemon which is the shortest—Romans being the longest of Paul's Epistles—which tells us that even when the Bible was put together, there was some uncertainty as to, is this really Paul? Because it doesn't have some of the fingerprints of Paul, like his introduction at the beginning: Paul an apostle unto you. He doesn't give his name, ever, the author.

Now, when we hear the phrase Son of God, we often think about the literal sense, which is true. But in the ancient world, in the Biblical times, the phrase Son of God was just another way of saying the legitimate king. And if you look at Mark, chapter 1, how does Jesus's gospel, how does that gospel begin? At the baptism of Jesus Christ. He comes up out of water and He hears this phrase, ""Thou art my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased."" And so Hebrews and Mark are both trying to help us see that the King of Heaven has His Son who will inherit all things, making Him greater than anything that we could put on the board.

So, he carries this idea through the—what did this Son do? He came down from Heaven and everything that was made, everything that was created was done through that Son, which we've tied into the beginnings of Mark, we're tying into the beginnings of John. You can kind of see how this whole epistle, once again, if you only had one book outside of the gospels to read, to kind of make sense of, how does this message now move forward among the Jewish group who's joining the Church? In my mind, there's nothing more all-inclusive than this epistle to the Hebrews to show all these different doctrines. Why? because it's glorifying Christ. It's putting Him at the center of every chapter. And there's an invitation to these Hebrews, wherever they may be living, whatever time period they're in, to not abandon Jesus Christ and to not let go of their covenant with Him, knowing that many of them are probably going to face severe persecution for embracing this Christian religion, this Christian faith.",0.0

Faith is the actual substance or substantiation or assurance (*hypostasis* ) and the evidence or evincing (*elenchos* ) of things not seen that are true (Heb. 11:1; Alma 32:21). True faith necessarily manifests itself in works of righteousness. Chapter 12 thus exhorts the faithful to endure the chastening and correction of God, who is the Father of their spirits. By inheriting the blessings of eternity as sons of the living God, his Saints are able to come to the new Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, being made perfect, an assembly of ""firstborns"" (*prototokon* ), having inherited all with the Firstborn.

Chapter 13 concludes by noting that ""marriage is honourable in all,"" and by counseling all to ""let brotherly love continue,"" to ""be without covetousness,"" and to be loyal to Jesus alone, ""bearing his reproach, for here [on earth] have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come"" (Heb. 13:1, 4-5, 13-14).

This is more of a general epistle pushing back against judaizers and everything that they hold so sacred from the Old Testament and from the old law of Moses. This book is showing the supremacy and the majesty of Jesus Christ as being greater than all of those things.

So it turns out the first four verses give that as a very clear thesis statement. And then, it turns out, the chapters are broken up, identifying really amazing things from the Old Testament. You have angels; Jesus is better than them or superior. You have Moses and Mount Sinai; Jesus is superior. You have priests and Melchizedek; Jesus is superior. You have the whole sacrificial system that was meant to point people to Jesus Christ; He is superior. So as you read through these chapters you're looking for all the really amazing things. We should not denigrate them from the Old Testament. But ultimately, we will see that Jesus Christ surpasses them all. And the opening thesis statement, these first four verses, gives that quite clearly.",1.0

Latter-day Saints are interested that, in replacing Judas, one apostle was chosen to complete the Twelve and that Peter set the qualifications of apostles: They must know the ministry of Jesus, they must be ordained, and they must be witnesses of his resurrection (Acts 1:21-22). Latter-day apostles in the Church are also ""special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world"" (D&C 107:23; cf. 27:12; 84:108). In addition, the book of Acts indicates the rich outpouring of the Holy Ghost in the early Church, both in the form of guiding revelation and in manifestations of the gifts of the spirit, characteristics that Latter-day Saints experience and value. Further, certain prophetic statements have particular meaning. For example, Latter-day Saints understand Paul's prophecy to the elders of Ephesus concerning mutinous problems within the early Church to be an inspired declaration about the impending apostasy (Acts 20:29-30). Moreover, they view Peter's prediction of Jesus' return from heaven at ""the times of restitution of all things"" as commencing with the latter-day restoration of the gospel (3:19-21). Further, the book of Acts has a good deal to say about the organization, doctrines, and character of the preaching of the early Christian church.

**THE EPISTLES.** Letters in the New Testament are traditionally divided into two groups, the writings of Paul and the general epistles.

The style of Paul's writings varies from the almost formal exposition in Romans to the charming persuasion in Philemon.",2.0

But he's the king of Salem or the king of peace. Hmm…who's the ultimate king of peace? The Prince of Peace. The king who comes to Salem or Jeru-salem. That's Jesus Christ. Verse 8: ""Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered."" Did you catch it? There it is again. We talked about that back in the opening chapters, that there's something about suffering that teaches us obedience, that purges our soul, that purifies us, that somehow makes us better. Verse 9: ""And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him."" Notice ""obedience"" in verse 8 and ""obey him"" in verse 9. There's a lot more going on in this epistle than just: confess Christ, love the Lord, and you're good. That's all you need to do. There's a lot more happening here with this turning to the Lord in greater obedience.

And it's important. Sometimes in the Church we have this disease called perfectionism, where we feel like it is our job to perfect ourselves and then, once we're done, then we'll say to Jesus: Tada. I'm like you. Can I now be entered into your presence? Being made perfect or complete or whole or oriented towards a larger purpose—this word, ""perfect,"" is actually a very significant word that has lots of expansive meanings far beyond just not having sin anymore in our lives.

Chapter 4, drawing in part upon Israelite temple symbolism, admonishes the Saints to enter into the rest of the Lord (Heb. 4:1, 11). This comes by believing, softening the heart, laboring, standing openly before God, relying on the compassion of Jesus the High Priest, and coming boldly to the mercy seat of God to find grace in time of need (Heb. 4:7, 11, 13, 15, 16).

Chapter 5 explains how Jesus obtained his authority to act as Israel's great High Priest. He did not presume to take this honor upon himself. As with Aaron, God chose him and bestowed authority upon him as ""a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec"" (Heb. 5:6; Ps. 110:4).",0.0

And you'll just see the richness that is packed into the book, this epistle to the Hebrews, and you'll see these powerful connections between the Old Testament and the New Testament to make this case really clear.

Paul and others, whoever is responsible for this book, they knew the Old Testament extremely well, and they're using examples and words and phrases and snippets and snatches from the Old Testament, peppered throughout this entire epistle.

Gal. 2-3; Rom. 2-5). Early on, Paul had taught his gentile converts that they did not need to live the Law of Moses in order to be justified before God. It was sufficient to make and keep the gospel covenant, the covenant of faith, to do this, while outward observance of the Law of Moses was not (Gal. 2:16). In particular, after Christ's Atonement, there was no longer any necessity of observing the earlier law and covenant of Moses, which were rendered obsolete by the law and covenant of the gospel (cf. Heb. 8:6-13; 3 Ne. 9:17-20). Thus, Paul's Gentile converts did not need to become Jews in order to become Christians (cf. Acts 15:5-29), for human beings are ""justified by faith without the deeds of the law"" (Rom. 3:28). A complete commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ, the covenant of faith, automatically fulfills all previous obligations before God, including the obligations of the Law of Moses.",3.0

However, Paul's second letter to the Corinthians is much more difficult to outline, and many scholars point to its ""unparalleled lack of apparent structure and unity,"" especially in the beginning of the letter.2 Because of this, many scholars believe that 2 Corinthians is actually a combination of two or more letters that were put together by a later scribe or editor sometime after Paul had written them. However, as evangelical scholar Craig Blomberg has noted, many of these apparent discrepancies in the letter can be resolved when the first seven chapters are read as a large chiasm focused on the Atonement of Jesus Christ.3. For reference and discussion of Blomberg's work, see Neal Rappleye, ""Chiasmus Criteria in Review,"" in Chiasmus: The State of the Art, 292–293."")

Biblical scholars have long recognized the use of chiasmus in the ancient world, especially among ancient Israelites. Paul, having been taught in the Jewish law and having been raised as a Jew, would have likewise been familiar with this literary practice. Indeed, as John W. Welch has observed, Paul used chiasmus to various extents throughout some of his other epistles, such as Galatians and 1 Corinthians.4, 213–219.

As a Jew, he was known by the name of Saul and was educated in Jerusalem as a Pharisee under the famous rabbi Gamaliel. He was also a Roman citizen by birth, a rare privilege for a Jew at that time.

They believe that God is a spirit and that the Godhead is only one God. In our view, these concepts are evidence of the falling away we call the Great Apostasy.

We maintain that the concepts identified by such nonscriptural terms as ""the incomprehensible mystery of God"" and ""the mystery of the Holy Trinity"" are attributable to the ideas of Greek philosophy. These philosophical concepts transformed Christianity in the first few centuries following the deaths of the Apostles. For example, philosophers then maintained that physical matter was evil and that God was a spirit without feelings or passions. Persons of this persuasion, including learned men who became influential converts to Christianity, had a hard time accepting the simple teachings of early Christianity: an Only Begotten Son who said he was in the express image of his Father in Heaven and who taught his followers to be one as he and his Father were one, and a Messiah who died on a cross and later appeared to his followers as a resurrected being with flesh and bones.

The collision between the speculative world of Greek philosophy and the simple, literal faith and practice of the earliest Christians produced sharp contentions that threatened to widen political divisions in the fragmenting Roman empire. This led Emperor Constantine to convene the first churchwide council in a.d. 325. The action of this council of Nicaea remains the most important single event after the death of the Apostles in formulating the modern Christian concept of deity. The Nicene Creed erased the idea of the separate being of Father and Son by defining God the Son as being of ""one substance with the Father.""",3.0

Their work was to bring all men to a ""unity of the faith"" regarding Jesus Christ and His teachings (Eph. 4:13).
3. **The Church of Christ and many simple truths were lost.**

Several Bible prophets declared that there would be a ""falling away"" (2 Thes. 2:3) from the true gospel, a time when there would be a ""famine"" (Amos 8:11) regarding the word of God, and ""divisions"" (1 Cor. 11:18) caused as ""grievous wolves"" (Acts 20:29) would enter and disrupt the flock or the people of the Church. These prophecies became a reality when in the years following the Savior's crucifixion, the Apostles were killed, the authority to direct the Church was eventually lost, and for many centuries, including the period known as the Dark Ages, the Church of Jesus Christ was not found on the earth.
4. **The hearts of men and a location were prepared for a restoration of the gospel.**

The closing of the Dark Ages took place as the Reformation unfolded, where brave men and women recognized the need to incorporate doctrines that Jesus had instituted back into the church. We are grateful for the great reformers such as Luther, Wycliffe, Wesley, Tyndale, and many others who helped set the stage for open religious dialogue, study of the scriptures, and the desire engendered in the hearts of good men and women for an expression of religious liberty. But their faith, their desire, their sacrifice, and even their martyrdom were insufficient to restore that which was lost.",3.0

In apparent dismay, Jesus turned to the Twelve and asked, ""Will ye also go away?""

Then it was that Simon Peter replied, ""Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.""

Note if you will that the words of eternal life were *not* with those who fell away, but rather with those who remained faithful and loyal.

Subsequently, during the administration of the Twelve, serious apostasy developed again. As a result, nearly all of the epistles of the New Testament were written to combat it.

While the Ephesian Saints were no stranger to persecution from the Greco-Roman world (see Acts 19:24–41), of much greater concern to Paul was that the Ephesian Saints remain loyal to the Lord and their covenants. Moreover, much of Paul's epistles were written in part to correct false beliefs and attitudes that were arising in the various churches, just as he had foretold.5

Shortly before he was executed under Nero's command, Paul warned Timothy that the prophesied rebellion was then at hand, as many churches Paul established had forsaken him and the gospel: ""All they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes"" (2 Timothy 1:15). This rebellion even reached some of Paul's most trusted missionary companions: ""Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.

While this may appear to be a bold claim, closer review of the New Testament shows that the Apostles knew of the forthcoming Apostasy and warned the Church extensively against the false teachers that would come in its wake.

The word *apostasy* comes from the Greek word *apostasia*, which literally means ""rebellion"" and in the New Testament connotes a people rebelling from God.1, 133–134."") However, the meaning of this word is unfortunately often masked in translations into English. For example, the King James Version of 2 Thessalonians 2:3 translates *apostasia* as ""falling away"": ""Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.""2 While not always clear in translations of the Bible, the connotation of *apostasy* as a rebellion against God is clearly described in the Book of Mormon (see 3 Nephi 6:18; 4 Nephi 1:38).

Noel B. Reynolds has noted that in light of the evidence from the New Testament and based on the meaning of *apostasy* as ""rebellion,"" it is a myth that ""the apostasy happened because of outside persecution.""3 Rather, the New Testament consistently describes the forthcoming Apostasy as an internal rebellion by members of the early Church against God and His chosen leaders—a rebellion that became more and more prominent as the Apostles wrote earnestly in hopes that the congregations might repent.4",3.0

The rise of revelatory communities, apostasies, and restorations has happened cyclically throughout the history of mankind, in a series of dispensations from the time of Adam and Enoch (Moses 7) to the present. Latter-day Saints see a historical ""great apostasy"" and subsequent loss of authority beginning in the New Testament era and spreading in the centuries immediately following that era. Though Latter-day Saints have not emphasized the great apostasy as much as they have the concept that the Church is a revelatory restoration, the need of a restoration implies that something important was lost after the departure of the primitive Christian church.

The English word ""apostasy"" derives from the Greek *apostasía* or *apóstasis* (""defection, revolt""; used in a political sense by Herodotus and Thucydides); it is mentioned in a religious context in the Septuagint and the New Testament (e.g., Josh. 22:22 and 2Chr. 29:19; 2 Thes. 2:3states that an *apostasía* must come before the second coming of Christ).

This time the people turned against Christ and His Apostles. The collapse was so great we have come to know it as the Great Apostasy, which led to the centuries of spiritual stagnation and ignorance called the Dark Ages.

Now, I need to be very clear about these historically reoccurring periods of apostasy and spiritual darkness. Our Heavenly Father loves all of His children, and He wants them all to have the blessings of the gospel in their lives. Spiritual light is not lost because God turns His back on His children. Rather, spiritual darkness results when His children turn their collective backs on Him. It is a natural consequence of bad choices made by individuals, communities, countries, and entire civilizations. This has been proven again and again throughout the course of time. One of the great lessons of this historical pattern is that our choices, both individually and collectively, do result in spiritual consequences for ourselves and for our posterity.

In every dispensation, God's loving desire to bless His children is manifest in the miraculous restoration of the gospel truth to the earth through living prophets. The Restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith in the early 1800s is only the most recent example. Similar restorations were accomplished in earlier times through such prophets as Noah, Abraham, Moses, and, of course, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.",3.0

Apostolic authority ceased just after the New Testament period, and without apostolic leadership and authority the Church was soon overwhelmed by alien intellectual and cultural pressures. The simple affirmations of biblical faith were turned into the complex propositions of theology. Though subsequent churches were still ""Christian,"" in the LDS view they no longer possessed the *fulness* of the gospel of Jesus Christ or apostolic authority. Latter-day Saints would agree with Catholics and ""high church"" Protestants that apostolic authority is essential in the true church but would also agree with other Protestants that apostolic authority was lacking in medieval orthodoxy. A close parallel is presented by Protestant rejection of Roman Catholic claims to binding apostolic authority. While Latter-day Saints trace the Apostasy to roughly the second century and reject subsequent orthodoxy, most Protestants would place it somewhere nearer the fifteenth century and then reject subsequent Catholicism.

Protestants who denied the necessity of apostolic succession, or who did not believe its links were severed by the Reformation, generally held that the fulness of the gospel could be achieved by reforming the Roman Church. Latter-day Saints, who insist on the necessity of apostolic succession but believe its links were severed early, see a reformation as inadequate for recovering the fulness of the gospel and reestablishing original Christianity.

In the language of that philosophy, God the Father ceased to be a Father in any but an allegorical sense. He ceased to exist as a comprehensible and compassionate being.

As Peter told the Saints in Jerusalem, ""the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began,"" would come (Acts 3:21). This restitution of all things was begun by God the Father and Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith.

As Faulconer explained, ""We cannot understand what apostasy means for New Testament Christians without understanding that it included the loss of the temple and, so, of the priesthood, for ultimately the rebellion of apostasy involves severing one's covenant relation to God, a relation manifest through the priesthood, through standing in the presence of God.""10 A serious part of the Restoration entailed restoring covenants and temples, thereby providing a corrective course to this rebellion that corrupted many early Christian doctrines and beliefs. Covenants are essential to the gospel of Jesus Christ, and they allow us to grow closer to our Savior and become more like Him.",2.0

Talmage wrote *The Great Apostasy*, in which he gathered New Testament passages that Latter-day Saints have cited to show that a great apostasy was predicted by Jesus Christ, Paul, and other apostles and prophets (esp. Matt. 24:4-13, 23-26; Acts 20:29-30; Gal. 1; 2 Thes. 2:7-8; 1 Tim. 4:1-3; 2 Tim. 3:1-6;4:1-4; Jude 1:3-4; Rev. 13:4-9;14:6-7; and in the Old Testament, Amos 8:11-12). Talmage also chronicled the persecution of early Christians that hastened the Apostasy and described the primitive Church as changing internally in several respects. He argued that the simple principles of the gospel were mixed with the pagan philosophical systems of the day (Trinitarianism, resulting in the Nicene Creed; false opposition of body and spirit, creating excessive asceticism); that rituals were changed and added to in unauthorized ways (simple early Christian rites were replaced by complex pagan-influenced ceremonies; baptism by immersion was lost; the baptism of infants was introduced cf. [Moro. 8]; communion was changed); and that church organization was altered (the apostles and prophets, the necessary foundation of the church of Christ, were martyred, leaving a void that could not be filled by bishops; thus the medieval church showed little similarity to the organization or practices of the New Testament church).",2.0

In 1833, referring to Mark 16:17-18 and 1Corinthians 12, Joseph Smith stated: ""By the foregoing testimonies we may look at the Christian world and see [that] the apostasy there has been from the apostolic platform"" (*TPJS*, p. 15). Oliver Cowdery wrote on the apostasy in the first issue of the messenger and advocate (1834). In 1840 Orson Pratt spoke of ""a general and awful apostasy from the religion of the New Testament"" (*Listen to the Voice of Truth*, 1.1). He particularly emphasized a lack of binding ordinances because of the absence of priesthood authority; baptism was a key example. In Pratt's view all churches before the Restoration were wrong in some ways, doctrinally and ritually, even though they might be right in others. Benjamin Winchester, an early LDS pamphleteer, wrote an extensive treatise using New Testament sources to demonstrate that an apostasy had been prophesied (*A History of Priesthood*, Philadelphia, 1843, pp. 72-96). In the 1850s and 1860s many references were made to ""the great apostasy"" (O. Pratt, *JD* 12:247) and ""the great falling away"" (W. Woodruff, *JD* 8:262) in Latter-day Saint sermons.

This idea-breaking off from established religion because it seems out of tune with New Testament Christianity-has obvious Protestant overtones, but the LDS view differs from typical Protestant attitudes in its emphasis on the loss and restoration of exclusive, clear-cut priesthood authority, correct ordinances, and continuing revelation. In contrast, Protestants typically rely primarily on biblical reinterpretation.",1.0

Latter-day Saints who have seriously contravened or ignored cardinal Church teachings (publicly or privately) are considered apostates, whether or not they have officially left the Church or affiliated with another religion. By not participating in Church meetings one is not considered apostate. However, when individuals ask to have their names removed from Church records, policy requires such requests to be honored. A Church disciplinary procedure may be held for any member who violates important commandments and ""will not repent"" (Mosiah 26:32; D&C 42:28). Open repudiation of the Church, its leaders, and teachings is one ground for excommunication.

The steps to apostasy are usually gradual. All members are counseled to guard against all manifestations of personal apostasy (*DS* 3:293-312; Asay, pp. 67-68). The most frequent causes of apostasy are failure to maintain strict standards of morality, taking personal offense (real or perceived), marrying someone who is of another faith or who is irreligious, neglecting to pray and maintain spirituality, or misunderstanding of the teachings of the Church.

Apostasy may be accelerated by a faulty assumption that scripture or Church leaders are infallible. Joseph Smith taught that ""a prophet was a prophet only when he was acting as such"" (*HC* 5:265). He also declared he ""was but a man, and [people] must not expect me to be perfect"" (*HC* 5:181). Neither the Church nor its leaders and members claim infallibility.

Above all, the Church affirms that its members should seek personal revelation to know the truth and live in tune with the spirit of God. Those who have not done this may drop by the wayside when their faith is challenged or when difficulties arise.",2.0

Devoted disciples of Jesus Christ always have been and always will be valiant missionaries. A missionary is a follower of Christ who testifies of Him as the Redeemer and proclaims the truths of His gospel.

The Church of Jesus Christ always has been and always will be a missionary church. The individual members of the Savior's Church have accepted the solemn obligation to assist in fulfilling the divine commission given by the Lord to His Apostles, as recorded in the New Testament:

""Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

""Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen"" (Matthew 28:19–20).

Latter-day Saints take seriously this responsibility to teach all people in all nations about the Lord Jesus Christ and His restored gospel. We believe the same Church founded by the Savior anciently has been reestablished on the earth by Him in the latter days. The doctrine, principles, priesthood authority, ordinances, and covenants of His gospel are found today in His Church.

When we invite you to attend church with us or to learn with the full-time missionaries, we are not trying to sell you a product. As members of the Church, we do not receive prizes or bonus points in a heavenly contest. We are not seeking simply to increase the numerical size of the Church. And most importantly, we are not attempting to coerce you to believe as we do. We are inviting you to hear the restored truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ so you can study, ponder, pray, and come to know for yourself if the things we are sharing with you are true.",0.0

They also called upon others to help them fulfill the Lord's command.

Today, under the direction of modern apostles and prophets, that same charge has been extended to missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. These missionaries serve in more than 150 nations. As representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ, they strive to fulfill that divine command—renewed in our day by the Lord Himself—to take the fulness of the gospel abroad and bless the lives of people everywhere.6

Missionaries in their late teens or early 20s are young in ways of the world. But they are blessed with gifts—such as the power of the Holy Spirit, the love of God, and testimonies of the truth—that make them powerful ambassadors of the Lord. They share the good news of the gospel that will bring true joy and everlasting happiness to all who heed their message. And in many instances they do so in a country and a language foreign to them.

Missionaries strive to follow Jesus Christ in both word and deed. They preach of Jesus Christ and of His Atonement.7 They teach of the literal Restoration of Christ's ancient Church through the Lord's first latter-day prophet, Joseph Smith.

It is our responsibility to espouse and follow an inspired program of instruction and activity, and to build and maintain appropriate facilities for the accomplishment of this, that all who will hear and accept may grow in understanding of doctrine and develop in principles of Christian service to their fellowmen.

We too, as Christ's disciples, are invited to heed His commission today, as if we were there on that mountain in Galilee when He first proclaimed it.

Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, after restoring his gospel in our day and establishing his Church, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, revealed through his Prophet, Joseph Smith, the following:

""Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.

""For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape.

Each of my brethren of the Council of the Twelve has the same responsibility I have to declare these things to the world and to bear record of them before all men.

Toward the end of his mortal ministry, the Lord commanded the Prophet Joseph Smith as follows:

""Make a solemn proclamation of my gospel … to all the kings of the world, to the four corners thereof … and to all nations of the earth."" (D&C 124:2–3.) He was to invite them to come to the light of truth, and use their means to build up the kingdom of God on earth.

In the spirit of this divine direction, on the sixth day of April 1845, and shortly after the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum had mingled their blood with that of the other martyrs of true religion, the Council of the Twelve made such a proclamation. They address it:

*To the President of the United States of America;*

The University of Utah was chartered in 1850 by our pioneer forebears. Brigham Young University came along later, outlasting most of the Church academies. It has grown until its present enrollment numbers more than 27,000. That is a large number of students, but it is a very small fraction of the young people of the Church worthy of a university education. We can accommodate only a relatively few. If we cannot give to all, why should we give to any? The answer is that if we cannot give to all, let us give to as many as we can. The number who can be accommodated on campus is finite, but the influence of the university is infinite. Tremendous efforts are being made to enlarge and extend that influence.",1.0

""Utah stands first in the nation in the total population ages 3 to 34 enrolled in school.

""Utah stands first in the percentage of the total population enrolled in school at every age level except ages 16–17, where Minnesota ranks first. …

""Utah stands first in the average years of school completed for all of its citizens age 25 and older. …

""Utah stands first in expenditures on the operating programs of medical schools per $100,000 of personal income in the state.""

And then he said this: ""The Carnegie Commission on Higher Education surveyed the performance of higher education in each of the 50 states. It found Utah, unlike many states, to have no major deficiencies.""

Remarkable, isn't it?

Then he asked, ""Why has Utah done so well? It is neither the richest, nor the oldest, nor the best located state for educational development. If one could find its secret, perhaps it could be exported elsewhere. But this is not easy, for its secret, I think, is its history. Your early leaders placed a great emphasis on education.""

Then later they were sent up into Idaho, where a sawmill and a gristmill were needing to be built. My father's family had settled in Farmington, Utah, part of this colonization that I'm referring to—the colonization that made people stronger and gave them opportunities. Rather than being lost in a big city, they were asked to move to a smaller community where they could develop their ability and where there would be more schools and a need for more schoolteachers and where people with talent would develop their ability. Out of all of this, my family were asked to leave Farmington and Tooele, to sell their green acres, and go out into southern Idaho, where there was nothing at that time but sagebrush.

In a little settlement of that kind, my mother and father fell in love. By the time they were 20 years old and ready to be married, where would they be married? In the Logan Utah Temple. How would they get there? By buggy. How long would it take? Well, five or six or seven days. Highways and good roads? Of course not. They went by roads made by wagons going over the sagebrush and through the bushes and over the rocks. Where would they be married? Where would they be sealed? Only one place—the temple. They went by buggy.

That became part of my heritage. And so people grew up in these little towns. Then the Church decided to open some academies, and they opened some 30 of them out in these areas far away. One of those little academies was opened in our town, and it became an area where many from neighboring areas would move into that little town to get a higher education. Of course, the higher education was only a high school, but it was referred to as an academy.",1.0

I almost become angry when I hear of complaining among the students or the faculty. I am grateful to be able to say that with very few exceptions those who come to learn and those who teach are appreciative and mindful of the great blessing that is theirs.

Moreover, the university has brought much favorable notice to the Church. Its sponsoring organization, the Church, is widely recognized. It has become known for standards and ideals which have been written about and talked about and which have let the world know of those things in which we believe. Its academic programs and its athletic programs have both brought honor to the university and the Church. And as generations of students move through its halls and on to graduation and then out across the world, they will bring honor to their alma mater and its sponsor, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

We shall continue to support BYU and its Hawaii campus. We shall continue to support Ricks College. We are not likely to build other university campuses. We wish that we might build enough to accommodate all who desire to attend. But this is out of the question. They are so terribly expensive. But we shall keep these as flagships testifying to the great and earnest commitment of this Church to education, both ecclesiastical and secular, and while doing so prove to the world that excellent secular learning can be gained in an environment of religious faith.

Backing up these institutions will be our other schools, our institutes of religion, scattered far and wide, and the great seminary system of the Church.

It is hoped that through these our youth, wherever they may be, may experience some of the good to be had at BYU.

If they wanted statehood, which they did and which Brigham felt very strongly about, they couldn't pass any anti-slavery laws.

The specific intent of the slavery laws in Utah (there were two, one for black people and one for Native Americans, passed within a month of each other) was to eventually lead to the complete elimination of slavery. Slavery in Utah was a step between the slavery of the South and indentured servitude.

There were some differences between the two laws, but basically, slaves had to come into the territory willingly and couldn't be sold or forced to move out of the territory if they didn't want to be. There were term limits on the contracts and education was required for all slaves. If masters slept with their slaves, even if it was consensual, or they neglected to feed, clothe, or shelter them, or if they abused the slaves, the contracts were null and void and the slaves were to be freed. There were also fines and potential prison sentences for the masters if they violated their contacts. There were legal recourses for the slaves and term limits imposed, which was very different from Southern slavery, and more akin to indentured servitude.

Obviously, some people abused these laws and looked for loopholes and other people were treated very badly, but the intent was to be better than those in the South and to eventually eliminate the practice from the territory.",1.0

Religious persecution of the 1830s and 1840s in the more populated eastern states necessitated the movement of the Latter-day Saints to the West, where they could be more isolated. The Prophet Joseph Smith had designated Jackson County, Missouri, on the fringes of civilization, as the Zion of the latter days. However, continued persecution in Ohio, in Missouri, and later in Illinois caused the Latter-day Saints to seek a refuge in the Rocky Mountains, farther to the west, where they could worship God and practice their religious beliefs in the absence of religious bigotry, in land claimed by Mexico. To approximately 80,000 LDS pioneers who gathered from many nations and traveled across the great American desert by wagons before the advent in 1869 of the railroad, and to the thousands who followed afterward, the LDS presence in the Salt Lake Valley was compared to a fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy of the latter days, the City of God, established in the top of the mountains where people from all nations could gather to the House of the Lord to learn his ways (Isa. 2:1-3). To the Latter-day pioneers, President Brigham Young's words expressed their feelings: ""This is the place.""

The seventeen-mile-wide by twenty-five-mile-long Salt Lake Valley is some 4,500 feet above sea level and is surrounded by towering mountain peaks of the Wasatch Range that rise to over 11,000 feet. The valley is part of the Great Basin, where river waters are kept from flowing into the Pacific Ocean by high mountains. Lake Bonneville once lay within the Great Basin, and geologists say that it measured 1,000 feet deep where Salt Lake City is now located. The current Great Salt Lake is the evaporation remnant of that inland sea.",3.0

He had the genius to have people go out and look for the valleys and the areas away from Salt Lake City where the pioneers who would pour into this valley could go and settle and make their homes and build cities and communities and build their personalities and their characters and develop the talents that would be theirs. So rather than having a large city in Salt Lake, under his leadership some 360 communities were developed out in Wyoming and Nevada and Arizona and southern Idaho as well as in Utah.

As people moved out and set up in these little communities, they developed their talents and abilities by serving on school boards and on town councils or became leading people in a little town. They became citizens of that area, and they started building schools and expanding those communities. We see what has happened in these areas that Brigham Young envisioned and which he helped set in motion. Just think of how that has developed—of the developing of a settlement, for example, in Las Vegas, Nevada, so that people could go down to San Bernardino, California. The people could come by ship into San Pedro, California, go to San Bernardino to be outfitted and helped with the equipment necessary to come into this valley, and then into the outlying communities, down into Sanpete County or up into Idaho or elsewhere.",2.0

Both categories are authoritative, since both are viewed as coming from God.

The first definition uses ""scripture"" as synonymous with such terms as ""inspired"" or ""divinely revealed."" Concerning those who have been called and ordained to proclaim God's word, a revelation in the Doctrine and Covenants provides the foundation: ""Whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation"" (D&C 68:4). In this light, Latter-day Saints hold in high regard the words of Church leaders at all levels. Especially authoritative are the official pronouncements of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who are sustained by Church members as ""prophets, seers, and revelators."" Their writings and addresses-particularly in general conference-are cited frequently as guides for living and for authoritative interpretation of doctrine. Statements issued by the First Presidency represent the official position and policy of the Church.

Joseph Smith taught that ""a prophet was a prophet only when he was acting as such"" (*HC* 5:265). Thus, the words of prophets carry the force of scripture only when they are uttered under the influence of the Holy Ghost. Latter-day Saints freely acknowledge this divine influence in the teachings and counsel of leaders and deem it a privilege to be instructed by them. They consider this inspired direction to be ""scripture"" in the broad definition and endeavor to harmonize their lives with it.",3.0

The Church's lay participation, which entails the sharing of responsibility, and the law of common consent operate together in the process of presenting, confirming, and accepting the inspired word.

For Latter-day Saints, the scriptures are not reducible to scientific history, sociology, or folklore; a simple set of fundamentals, commandments, and legal apparatus; charming parabolic accounts; esoteric and hidden names with mystical connections that have a power and life of their own. The scriptures are the result of an outpouring from on high whose present meaning and relevance to a person require painstaking study and direct inspiration.

To you God is One who revealed Himself once and no more; but to us He speaks out of the burning thornbush of the present&#133;in the revelations of our innermost hearts-greater than words"" (p. 204). This statement captures much of the spirit of the LDS approach to scripture. Meaning and power rise against ""hardening"" traditions and sponsor trust in the living witness of the Spirit to illumine, clarify, and sanctify scripture as the ""present truth.""

First, one knows whether another is speaking with the authority of the Holy Ghost only by the influence of the Holy Ghost. Thus, in the last analysis, the burden of proof for scriptural status is placed upon the reader and hearer (cf. Brigham Young, *JD* 7:2). Latter-day Saints teach that all are entitled to this assurance and testimony. Second, the President of the Church and those associated with him as prophets, seers, and revelators have received a special spiritual Endowment and jurisdiction. The President alone speaks or writes for the Church and to the Church as a whole. Others can function similarly, but only within their own offices and callings. Further, ""a prophet was a prophet only when he was acting as such"" (*HC* 5:265; 2:302; *TPJS*, p. 278). Those officially called and ordained to lead are, in LDS terminology, the ""living oracles,"" and ""Where the oracles of God are not there the Kingdom of God is not"" (*WJS*, p. 156). Only the President of the Church has the responsibility and burden of exercising all the keys of scriptural presentation and declaration. These principles and practices are established to safeguard the sanctity, and vitalize the application, of inspired speaking and writing, both past and present.",3.0

Therefore, being in the scriptures is one way we receive the Holy Ghost. Of course, scripture is given through the Holy Ghost in the first place (see 2 Peter 1:21; D&C 20:26–27; 68:4), and that same Spirit can attest its truth to you and me. Study the scriptures carefully, deliberately. Ponder and pray over them. Scriptures are revelation, and they will bring added revelation.

Consider the magnitude of our blessing to have the Holy Bible and some 900 additional pages of scripture, including the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Then consider that, in addition, the words of prophets spoken as they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost in settings such as this, which the Lord calls scripture (see D&C 68:2–4), flow to us almost constantly by television, radio, Internet, satellite, CD, DVD, and in print. I suppose that never in history has a people been blessed with such a quantity of holy writ. And not only that, but every man, woman, and child may possess and study his or her own personal copy of these sacred texts, most in his or her own language. How incredible such a thing would have seemed to the people of William Tyndale's day and to the Saints of earlier dispensations! Surely with this blessing the Lord is telling us that our need for constant recourse to the scriptures is greater than in any previous time. May we feast continuously on the words of Christ that will tell us all things we should do (see 2 Nephi 32:3). I have studied the scriptures, I have pondered the scriptures, and on this Eastertide, I bear you my testimony of the Father and the Son, as They are revealed in the holy scriptures, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",2.0

""You may hug up to yourselves the Bible,"" said Joseph Smith, ""but except through faith in it you can get revelation for yourself, the Bible will profit you but little"" (Osborne). Further, ""the best way to obtain truth and wisdom is not to ask it from books, but to go to God in prayer, and obtain divine teaching"" (*TPJS*, p. 191). Brigham Young asserted that ""I would rather have the living oracles than all the writing in the books"" (cited in *CR*, Oct. 1897, pp. 22-23). But living oracles and responsible laymen are not, in theory or in tradition, wholly independent of the written word. B. H. Roberts, an authoritative second-generation historian and a General Authority, wrote of the corpus of scripture:
It fixes permanently the general truths which God has revealed. It preserves, for all time and for all generations of men, the great frame-work of the plan of salvation-the Gospel. There are certain truths that are not affected by ever-changing circumstances; truths which are always the same, no matter how often they may be revealed; truths which are elementary, permanent, fixed; from which there must not be, and cannot be, any departure without condemnation. The written word of God preserves the people of God from vain and foolish traditions, which, as they float down the stream of time, are subject to changes by distortion, by addition or subtraction, or by the fitful play of fancy in fantastic and unreliable minds. It forms a standard by which even the living oracles of God may instruct themselves, measure themselves, and correct themselves. It places within the reach of the people, the power to confirm the oral words, and the ministry of the living oracles, and thus to add faith to faith, and knowledge to knowledge [*IE* 3 (May 1900):576-77].",3.0

The idea of an open canon has meant historically a certain openness to other historical, apocryphal, and pseudepigraphical sources. Modern scripture assures Latter-day Saints that important records will yet come to light (cf. 2 Ne. 29:10-14; A of F 9). The Old Testament Apocrypha contains many things ""that are true"" but also many interpolations (D&C 91); ""To those who desire it, should be given by the Spirit to know the true from the false"" (*HC* 1:363).

These constitute the canonized, authoritative corpus of revealed writings against which all else is measured. President Joseph Fielding Smith taught, ""My words, and the teachings of any other member of the Church, high or low, if they do not square with the revelations, we need not accept them&#133;. We have accepted the four standard works as the measuring yardsticks, or balances, by which we measure every man's doctrine"" (*DS* 3:203).

While the Church views its scriptures as a canon in a strict sense, they are not viewed as closed. The doctrine of continuing revelation is one of the fundamental beliefs of the Church. As was expressed by Joseph Smith, ""We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God"" (A of F 9). While accepting ""all that God has revealed,"" whether canonized in the scriptures or not, Latter-day Saints also believe that revelation continues to enlighten their leaders. Moreover, additional divine guidance is anticipated because God ""will yet reveal many great and important things."" Those future revelations will be scripture, according to the broad definition, and it is likely that some of them will be added to the scriptures in due time.

Interesting as these matters may be, study of the Book of Mormon is most rewarding when one focuses on its *primary* purpose—to testify of Jesus Christ. By comparison, all other issues are incidental.

When you read the Book of Mormon, concentrate on the principal figure in the book—from its first chapter to the last—the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God.3 And look for a second undergirding theme: God will keep His covenants with the remnants of the house of Israel.4

The Book of Mormon is a crucial component of that covenant.5 It is holy scripture that encompasses sacred writings from the small and large plates of Nephi, the plates of Mormon, the plates of Ether, and the plates of brass, which contained ""the five books of Moses, … a record of the Jews, … and … prophecies of the holy prophets.""6

The central event in the Book of Mormon is the appearance of the resurrected Christ to righteous inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere after his ascension into heaven at Jerusalem. During his visit, Christ delivered a sermon that is similar to the Sermon on the Mount recorded in the New Testament, but with certain vital clarifications and additions. He declared his doctrine, the fulness of his gospel necessary to enter the kingdom of God; and he established his Church with its essential ordinances, and ordained disciples to preside over the Church. At this time, Christ also explained the promises of God to Israel; healed the sick and disabled; blessed the children and their parents; and expressed his great love, allowing each individual to come forward and touch the wounds he had received during his crucifixion (see 3 Ne. 11-26). The record of Jesus' visit and many other passages in the Book of Mormon verify the divine sonship, ministry, Atonement, resurrection, and eternal status of the Lord Jesus Christ and show that the fulness of his gospel is the same for all people, whenever and wherever they have lived.",3.0

Their writings centered upon the Lord, His mission, and His ministry. Jacob, for example, repeatedly referred to the Atonement and Resurrection of Christ. ""Beloved brethren,"" wrote Jacob, ""be reconciled unto [God] through the atonement of Christ, his Only Begotten Son, and ye may obtain a resurrection, … and be presented as the first-fruits of Christ unto God. …

""And now, … why not speak of the atonement of Christ, and attain to a perfect knowledge of him,"" and a ""knowledge of a resurrection and the world to come?""18

Jacob's advice is priceless and timeless.

The Savior declared that the Book of Mormon contains ""the fulness of [His] everlasting gospel.""19 How did He define the *gospel?* The resurrected Lord taught, ""This is the gospel which I have given unto you—that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.""20

Have you ever wondered why there are so many Christian churches in the world today when they obtain their doctrines from essentially the same Bible? It is because they interpret the Bible differently. If they interpreted it the same, they would be the same church. This is not a condition the Lord desires, for the Apostle Paul declared that there is ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism"" (Ephesians 4:5). To help bring this oneness about, the Lord established a divine law of witnesses. Paul taught, ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Corinthians 13:1).

The Bible is one witness of Jesus Christ; the Book of Mormon is another. Why is this second witness so crucial? The following illustration may help: How many straight lines can you draw through a single point on a piece of paper? The answer is infinite. For a moment, suppose that single point represents the Bible and that hundreds of those straight lines drawn through that point represent different interpretations of the Bible and that each of those interpretations represents a different church.

What happens, however, if on that piece of paper there is a second point representing the Book of Mormon? How many straight lines could you draw between these two reference points: the Bible and the Book of Mormon? Only one. Only one interpretation of Christ's doctrines survives the testimony of these two witnesses.",3.0

To members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Book of Mormon forms the doctrinal foundation of the Church and speaks the word of God to all the world.

The Book of Mormon both confirms and supplements the Bible: ""Behold, this [the Book of Mormon] is written for the intent that ye may believe that [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe [the Book of Mormon] also"" (Morm. 7:9). The Bible is primarily a record of God's dealings with the forebears and descendants of Jacob or Israel in the ancient Near East. Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of God's dealings principally with another group of Israelites he brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem about 600 B.C. (see Lehi). They anticipated the birth and coming of Jesus Christ and believed in his Atonement and gospel. Their complex, lengthy records were abridged by a prophet named Mormon, inscribed on plates of gold, and buried by his son, Moroni 2, after internecine wars destroyed all of the believers in Christ in the New World except Moroni (A.D. 385).",3.0

Three mutually supportive avenues are most often followed. First, the book serves as a source of guidance and doctrine, yielding lessons and wisdom applicable to contemporary life. This approach is recommended in the writings of Nephi, who wrote that he ""did liken the scriptures unto [his people], that it might be for [their] profit and learning"" (1 Ne. 19:23). Latter-day Saints find its pages rich with ennobling narratives, clear doctrines, eternal truths, memorable sayings, and principles. Knowing the conditions of the latter days, the ancient prophets periodically address the individual reader directly. Latter-day Saints emphasize the need to read the Book of Mormon prayerfully, with faith in God, to benefit personally from its teachings and to come unto Christ.

A second approach to the Book of Mormon, adding historical dimension to the first approach, is to study the book as an ancient text. The reader who accepts the Book of Mormon as an ancient Hebrew lineage history written by prophets in the New World will find the book consistent with that description and setting. The book is a repository of ancient cultures that are as far removed from modern readers as are those of the Old and New Testaments. Continuing research has found Hebrew poetic forms, rhetorical patterns, and idioms, together with many Mesoamerican symbols, traditions, and artifacts, to be implicit in the book or consistent with it.",1.0

If the Old Testament words of Moses were sufficient, as some could have mistakenly thought them to be,3 then why, for example, the subsequent prophecies of Isaiah or of Jeremiah, who follows him? To say nothing of Ezekiel and Daniel, of Joel, Amos, and all the rest. If one revelation to one prophet in one moment of time is sufficient for *all* time, what justifies these many others? What justifies them was made clear by Jehovah Himself when He said to Moses, ""My works are without end, and … my words … never cease.""4

One Protestant scholar has inquired tellingly into the erroneous doctrine of a closed canon. He writes: ""On what biblical or historical grounds has the inspiration of God been limited to the written documents that the church now calls its Bible? … If the Spirit inspired only the written documents of the first century, does that mean that the same Spirit does not speak today in the church about matters that are of significant concern?""5 We humbly ask those same questions.

The Old Testament does not lose its value in our eyes when we are introduced to the New Testament, and the New Testament is only enhanced when we read the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. In considering the additional scripture accepted by Latter-day Saints, we might ask: Were those early Christians who for decades had access only to the primitive Gospel of Mark (generally considered the first of the New Testament Gospels to be written)—were they offended to receive the more detailed accounts set forth later by Matthew and Luke, to say nothing of the unprecedented passages and revelatory emphasis offered later yet by John? Surely they must have rejoiced that ever more convincing evidence of the divinity of Christ kept coming. And so do we rejoice.",3.0

No other collection of writings carried the insight, the power of teaching, and, consequently, the spiritual appeal to Christians. The New Testament also stands as the foundation of the restoration of the gospel in the latter days. It was while reading in the Epistle of James (1:5) that the youthful Joseph Smith was inspired to pray to the Lord about his confusion over religious matters, leading to his first vision (JS-H 1:7-20). The New Testament is one of the standard works or canonized scriptures accepted by Latter-day Saints, who seek spiritual strength and enlightenment from its pages. Further, they accept the New Testament sketches as accurate portrayals of the life and ministry of Jesus Christ as well as the ministry of his apostles and their associates, that reveal much of the order and organization of the earliest New Testament Church. Moreover, the New Testament includes many of God's covenants and commandments given personally by Jesus and, after his ascension, through his apostles. Latter-day Saints also value the New Testament prophecies about the latter days.

The writings of the New Testament were likely all produced within the first Christian century of the Christian era. Even so, its collection of texts went through three centuries of changes, and acceptance or rejection, before it acquired its recognized and current form, first listed in the Easter letter of Athanasius in Egypt in A.D. 367. The third synod of Carthage (A.D. 397) canonized the books of the New Testament as represented in the letter of Athanasius because each writing had three qualifications: apostolic authority, support of a major Christian community, and an absence of false teachings.",1.0

The idea of an open canon has meant historically a certain openness to other historical, apocryphal, and pseudepigraphical sources. Modern scripture assures Latter-day Saints that important records will yet come to light (cf. 2 Ne. 29:10-14; A of F 9). The Old Testament Apocrypha contains many things ""that are true"" but also many interpolations (D&C 91); ""To those who desire it, should be given by the Spirit to know the true from the false"" (*HC* 1:363). By analogy, other documents recently recovered (e.g., the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Nag Hammadi library, and related inscriptions and fragments) are viewed as instructive, though not canonical.

The word ""canon"" is used infrequently, in part because it connotes finality, completion, closure. In principle and in fact, additions, as well as occasional official clarifications and translations, are made to the standard works in the dual process of presentation through living leaders and, in accord with the law of common consent, acceptance by members of the Church. In this way, Latter-day Saints bind themselves by covenant to uphold them as scripture. The addition to the Doctrine and Covenants of both a revelation about the Celestial Kingdom received by Joseph Smith and a vision of the redemption of the dead received by President Joseph F. Smith are modern examples (D&C 137, 138).

The perpetual unending character of the scripture, a corpus ever augmented by living witnesses in a setting of prophecy and testimony, is a sign and symbol of the inclusiveness of LDS faith (Davies, p. 61). Such a position is in contrast with finalist and minimalist views (""one canon is enough""). The Samaritans, for example, accorded scriptural status to the Pentateuch alone. For Latter-day Saints, scripture is not ""final revelation."" There is no unexpandable ""circle of faith."" No sacred texts, because of their acknowledged holiness, forbid the addition of more sacred texts. No document or collection is ""all-sufficient"" for redemption, for salvation, for complete enlightenment, or for the perfecting of the soul.",3.0

Centuries after it was determined which books were to be included in the Bible, people began to believe and teach that the Bible was both complete (containing all that God had given through ancient prophets and apostles) and infallible (having been transmitted without any errors). Joseph Smith received correctives to both ideas, being given additional scripture originally written by ancient prophets and being inspired to make corrections in the texts of the Bible. Among the ancient writings he restored are the book of Abraham and the writings of Moses (canonized as the Book of Moses, itself including a restoration to Moses of an older Enoch writing; see Moses 6-7); quotations from ancient biblical prophets in the Book of Mormon (such as Joseph of Egypt and four otherwise unknown writers named Zenos, Zenock, Neum, and Ezias); and writings from the New Testament apostle John (see D&C 7 and 93).

Joseph Smith commented on the Bible's incompleteness: ""It was apparent that many important points touching the salvation of men, had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled"" (*TPJS*, pp. 10-11). He later said, ""Much instruction has been given to man since the beginning which we do not possess now&#133;. We have what we have, and the Bible contains what it does contain"" (*TPJS*, p. 61). The Prophet Joseph further stated, ""I believe the Bible as it read when it came from the pen of the original writers. Ignorant translators, careless transcribers, or designing and corrupt priests have committed many errors"" (*TPJS*, p. 327). Thus, the elements of mistranslation, incompleteness, and other errors weaken the Bible; but the spirit of its messages still reveals enough of God's word to fulfill his appointed purposes. Joseph Smith summarized thus: ""Through the kind providence of our Father a portion of His word which He delivered to His ancient saints, has fallen into our hands [and] is presented to us with a promise of a reward if obeyed, and with a penalty if disobeyed"" (*TPJS*, p. 61). Latter-day Saints have continued to trust in the general accuracy of the biblical texts even though they know that that text may not always be correct. Thus, they study and revere the Bible, especially in the context of other scriptures and modern revelation, which have much to say about the Bible and how it is to be interpreted, and as they study they ponder and pray that they may receive inspiration from God and come to understand the Bible's messages as they need to be applied in their lives (cf.

Two guesses who that last line is aimed at.

The Catholic Church also defines those ""private"" revelations as calling people to Christ, or visions like those given to Joan of Arc, rather than a witness that the Pope is divinely called of God.

The vision asserts (1) that the ancient authors wrote under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, (2) that originally their words contained the fulness of the gospel and were plain and easy to understand, but (3) that many things which were plain and precious, and many covenants, would be ""taken away"" from the original manuscripts; as a result, afterward (4) a great many persons, even with a Bible, would not understand the fulness of the gospel, but (5) the lost material would be restored through ""other records"" that the Lord would bring forth (1 Ne. 13:21-41). A somewhat parallel statement came to Joseph Smith in June 1830 while he was restoring a revelation received by Moses, declaring that many things would be taken ""from the book"" which Moses would write, but that the missing information would be restored through another prophet and thus be ""had again"" among those who believe (Moses 1:41). Latter-day Saints believe that the ""other records"" referred to include the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, the JST, and other records still to come forth, and that the prophet divinely raised up to begin restoring the lost material is Joseph Smith (see Scriptures: Forthcoming Scripture). In light of the foregoing statements, it is worth observing that the principal difficulty in the Bible apparently has been omissions.

Wright, ""The risen Jesus, at the end of Matthew's Gospel, does not say, 'All authority in heaven and on earth is given to the books you are all going to write,' but [rather] 'All authority in heaven and on earth is given to me.'

The Church's lay participation, which entails the sharing of responsibility, and the law of common consent operate together in the process of presenting, confirming, and accepting the inspired word.

For Latter-day Saints, the scriptures are not reducible to scientific history, sociology, or folklore; a simple set of fundamentals, commandments, and legal apparatus; charming parabolic accounts; esoteric and hidden names with mystical connections that have a power and life of their own. The scriptures are the result of an outpouring from on high whose present meaning and relevance to a person require painstaking study and direct inspiration.

Objecting to the views of the Torah as a closed world, Martin Buber wrote, ""To you God is one who created once and not again; but to us God is He who ""renews the work of creation every day.' To you God is One who revealed Himself once and no more; but to us He speaks out of the burning thornbush of the present&#133;in the revelations of our innermost hearts-greater than words"" (p. 204). This statement captures much of the spirit of the LDS approach to scripture. Meaning and power rise against ""hardening"" traditions and sponsor trust in the living witness of the Spirit to illumine, clarify, and sanctify scripture as the ""present truth.""

In effect, these passages contain the same injunction as the one at the close of the Apocalypse; and if the same interpretation and argument was applied to them as is applied to the closing verses of the book of Revelation, there would be no scripture after the writings of Moses. Such an absurdity would result in discarding the greater part of the Old Testament and all of the books of the New Testament.

A careful reading of each of these admonitions makes it clear that *man* is not to make changes in the revelations of the Lord: *man* is not to add to or take from the words of God. There is no indication or intimation that God could not, or would not, add to or take from; nor would any reasonable person with a belief in the divine powers of God consciously believe that God would be so restricted.

We remember that at the end of the book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible, the author, John, issues a warning and a curse upon any man who adds to or takes away from the book. Specifically, these are the words he wrote:

""For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:

""And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."" (Rev. 22:18–19.)

These verses of scripture have been cited repeatedly by those attempting to discredit the Book of Mormon, claiming that God's revelation to man is closed. Nothing more is to be added and nothing is to be taken away. They assert that the Book of Mormon is an attempt to add to the words of the Bible. These claims were made when the Book of Mormon was first published and have continued to be made, and are made today. Is there any validity to such assertions?",2.0

However, there is now overwhelming consensus among virtually all biblical scholars that this verse applies only to the book of Revelation, *not* the whole Bible. Those scholars of our day acknowledge a number of New Testament ""books"" that were almost certainly written *after* John's revelation on the Isle of Patmos was received. Included in this category are at least the books of Jude, the three Epistles of John, and probably the entire Gospel of John itself.1 Perhaps there are even more than these.

But there is a simpler answer as to why that passage in the final book of the current New Testament cannot apply to the whole Bible. That is because the whole Bible as we know it—one collection of texts bound in a single volume—did not exist when that verse was written. For centuries after John produced his writing, the individual books of the New Testament were in circulation singly or perhaps in combinations with a few other texts but almost *never* as a complete collection. Of the entire corpus of 5,366 known Greek New Testament manuscripts, only 35 contain the whole New Testament as we now know it, and 34 of those were compiled after a.d. 1000.2",2.0

Were it not for continuous revelation, Noah would not have been prepared for the deluge that encompassed the earth. Abraham would not have been guided from Haran to Hebron, the Land of Promise. Continuous revelation led the children of Israel from bondage back to their promised land. Revelation through prophets guided missionary efforts, directed the rebuilding of Solomon's temple, and denounced the infiltration of pagan practices among the Israelites.

Before the ascension of Christ, he promised the remaining eleven apostles, ""lo, I am with you alway, Even unto the end of the world."" (Matt. 28:20.) Following his ascension, he guided the Church by revelation until the death of the Apostles and subsequent apostasy of the Church of Jesus Christ.

A distinctive sign of the last days that will precede the eventual second coming of the Lord was seen in vision by that same Apostle who recorded the book of Revelation. He said:

""I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people."" (Rev. 14:6.)

If, for example, you go to Deuteronomy chapter 4 verses 1 through 2. God says O Israel, hearken unto the statutes and judgments and he says do not add unto the word which I command you and don't diminish it and don't take away. If you go back to Revelation chapter 22 verse 17, actually verse – Revelation 22 verse 19: ""If any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life."" People have interpreted this as saying no more revelation. No more revelation. And even here in D and C section 20 we want to be careful to not misinterpret what God has been saying in Deuteronomy, in the Book of Revelation, and right here.

It's not about God cannot add or change revelation. It actually comes to the core idea of a covenant which we've talked about a lot. And we've talked about it a lot because it' so significant. God wants to come together with us. And imagine God owns the covenant. He offers us the terms of the covenant. Should we be changing the terms? No. God can change the terms and offer them to us which we can accept, that's when we say amen after covenantal rituals but we are not supposed to be changing covenants. Now let me just use a brief example. If you've ever received a loan from a bank, say, for a mortgage? Would you go home with that agreement – that covenant with a bank – and you, without the bank's authorization, you change the agreement. That doesn't work. Now the bank can change the agreement; they can update the terms. It is their prerogative, they're the one who offered you all this money and so in some ways you're kind of duty-bound to follow their recommendations of really what they expect you to do. And if you don't, you have to give all the money back.",1.0

(Matt. 28:19.)

The same gifts of the Spirit which prevailed in the church at the time of Jesus are prevalent today. Some of these gifts are: revelation, healing, miracles, prophecy, and many others—as found in First Corinthians, twelfth chapter; Doctrine and Covenants, forty-sixth section; and in the tenth chapter of Moroni in the Book of Mormon. Charity—the pure love of Christ—will be in evidence among its membership.

The same power which Jesus gave to His apostles that ""whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven"" (Matt. 18:18) will also be in the true church today. There are ordinances and blessings bestowed by an authorized ministry to Church members. These covenants and obligations, if entered into and obeyed, apply not just for this life, but for all eternity.

Every individual in the Lord's church is entitled to the sure knowledge, received by personal revelation through the Holy Ghost, that the Church is true. Personal revelation to the individual is the strength of the Church of Jesus Christ in any age.

We must learn the truth for a surety and not merely suppose we are right. It is our responsibility to know—and by the aid of the scriptures and the Holy Ghost one can know without any doubt.

One cannot prayerfully study the scriptures without gaining the knowledge and testimony that there is only one way to exaltation. The scriptures point the way very clearly. It must be God's way and not man's way, for God has said: ""For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord."" (Isa. 55:8.)",2.0

If truth comes from one source—God—how can it be so diversely taught?

We know that all truth *does* emanate from God and is therefore unchangeable, consistent, and unified. Consequently, not all Christian churches with their dissimilar teachings can provide a fulness of truth. My intent is to assert with testimony and persuasion of scripture the reasons there can be only one Lord, one acceptable faith, one baptism, and one true church. Then if any of you are convinced you are mistaken in your present beliefs, you should have the courage to investigate and the faith to change and follow the true path Christ has outlined that assures one's eternal happiness.

When Jesus walked this earth among men, He proclaimed to His disciples: ""I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."" (John 14:6.) He proclaimed that the doctrines He taught were given to Him by his Father. He took no credit Himself—only that He was doing what the Father had given Him to do. ""For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth."" (John 5:20.)

""I and my Father are one,"" said the Savior. (John 10:30.) This statement does not mean they are one person, but that Jesus and His Father are one in purpose.

To hear and accept Jesus is to hear and accept His Father. Their teachings and objectives are identical. The doctrine of salvation is the same for all of God's progeny. Jesus prayed in His intercessory prayer to His Father concerning those who complied with His doctrines and ordinances: ""And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, *even as we are one.*"" (John 17:22; italics added.)",0.0

Jesus himself was an apostle through whom God spoke (Heb. 1:2;3:1). The Father sent Jesus, and whoever receives him receives the one who sent him (Mark 9:37; John 8:16-19). As the Father sent him, so Jesus sent his apostles (John 20:21). Initially, they were called from those who ""companied with us [the Twelve] all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us"" (Acts 1:21). The number twelve, associated with the apostles, echoes the number of tribes of Israel whom the apostles are to judge (Matt. 19:28; Luke 22:30). In this connection, they stood as the foundation of the early Christian church (Eph. 2:19-21;4:11-14).

At times, the term embraces more than the Twelve, as is implied both in the phrase ""all the apostles"" (1 Cor. 15:7)-which follows particular mention of ""the Twelve"" by Paul (1 Cor. 15:5)-and in references to persons named as apostles who were known not to be among the Twelve (Acts 14:14; Rom. 16:7). It is probable that by A.D. 54 the Lord's brother James had become one of the Twelve (1 Cor. 15:7; Gal. 1:19). Even so, most New Testament references to apostles refer to members of Jesus' original Twelve or to Paul. They were the guarantors or prime witnesses of Jesus' resurrection, which itself constituted the assurance that he was the expected Messiah and Lord of glory (Acts 1:8-11). In the first century, apostles were traveling witnesses to Jesus' resurrection, sent by him into the world for this purpose (Acts 1:8; cf. Matt. 28:19-20). At the group's core-and the Church's foundation-stood Peter, James, and John, who had been with or near Jesus during critical experiences, including his transfiguration (Mark 9:2-9) and his agony in Gethsemane (Mark 14:32-34).",0.0

After the resurrected Savior's ministry among the Nephites, they ""were all converted unto the Lord, upon all the face of the land, both Nephites and Lamanites, and there were no contentions and disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with another.

Some members assume that one can be in full harmony with the spirit of the gospel, enjoy full fellowship in the Church, and at the same time be out of harmony with the leaders of the Church and the counsel and direction they give. Such a position is wholly inconsistent, because the guidance of this Church comes not alone from the written word but also from continuous revelation, and the Lord gives that revelation to the Church through his chosen prophet. It follows, therefore, that those who profess to accept the gospel and who at the same time criticize and refuse to follow the counsel of the prophet are assuming an indefensible position.

Catholics affirm that grace centers in God's free gift offered through Christ in the sacraments and is infused to the soul. Baptism is essential for salvation. All sacraments are the necessary means of the grace needed for salvation. Mormon rites or ordinances are processes of spiritual rebirth in which the powers of godliness are manifest. They are received by all and all the ordinances are essential to salvation, from baptism to the higher ordinances of the temple.

He was the authorized servant of God. He fulfilled every requirement to complete the profile of a prophet. In due time Joseph received the ""keys of the kingdom."" With this apostolic power he reestablished the true church in its fullness and power. The Lord said to him: ""… this generation shall have my word through you."" (D&C 5:10.)

There is no greater prophet in any dispensation than Joseph Smith. He translated the Book of Mormon from ancient plates. Its purpose is to be another witness that Jesus is the Christ. Concerning this book, the Lord declared: ""And he has translated the book, even that part which I have commanded him, and as your Lord and your God liveth it is true."" (D&C 17:6.)

Joseph Smith was the Lord's anointed to restore Christ's Church to the earth. When he emerged from the grove of trees, he eventually learned four fundamental truths not then taught by the majority of the contemporary Christian world.

First, he learned that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, are two separate, distinct beings. The Bible confirms Joseph Smith's discovery. It tells us that the Son submitted His will to the Father (see Matthew 26:42). We are moved by the Savior's submission and find strength in His example to do likewise, but what would have been the depth and passion of Christ's submission or the motivational power of that example if the Father and the Son were the same being and in reality the Son was merely following His own will under a different name?

The scriptures give further evidence of this great truth: ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son"" (John 3:16). A father offering up his only son is the supreme demonstration of love that the human mind and heart can conceive and feel. It is symbolized by the touching story of Abraham and Isaac (see Genesis 22). But if the Father is the same being as the Son, then this sacrifice of all sacrifices is lost, and Abraham is no longer offering up Isaac—Abraham is now offering up Abraham.",3.0

You must trust that as you consistently live the truth the best you can, They will help you realize the purpose of your earth life and strengthen you to qualify for the blessings promised. To be obedient to the commandments of God requires an understanding of them. It necessitates faith in them. That comprehension is best obtained through personal study of doctrine. That is one of the reasons that in July of this year, President Hinckley and his counselors invited all members to read the Book of Mormon by the end of the year. They promised, ""Those who read the Book of Mormon will be blessed with an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a greater resolve to obey His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God.""5 I have tested and proven that promise in my own life and have confirmed its truth. If you have conscientiously obeyed that counsel, you know what I mean. If you have not yet begun, there is still time to have your life enriched by reading the pages of the Book of Mormon.

As we briefly told of the Restoration and of Joseph Smith, his profile focused in my mind in a most interesting way. It was an unusual experience.

Many of those who dismiss the work of the Restoration simply do not believe that heavenly beings speak to men on earth. Impossible, they say, that golden plates were delivered by an angel and translated by the power of God. From that disbelief, they quickly reject Joseph's testimony, and a few unfortunately sink to discrediting the Prophet's life and slandering his character.

There is no dispute about what Joseph Smith accomplished, only how he did what he did and why. And there are not many options. He was either pretender or prophet. Either he did what he did alone, or he had the help of heaven. Look at the evidence, but look at all of the evidence, the entire mosaic of his life, not any single piece. Most importantly, do as young Joseph and ""ask … God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given [you].""17 This is not only how you may learn the truth about the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith; it is also the pattern to know the truth of all things.18

Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, as is Thomas S. Monson today. Through Joseph Smith, ""the keys of the kingdom of God are [again] committed unto man on the earth, and … the gospel [will] roll forth … as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands … , until it has filled the whole earth.""19

God is our Eternal Father, and Jesus is the Christ. We worship Them. Nothing compares with Their creations, the plan of salvation, and the atoning sacrifice of the Lamb of God. In this dispensation, we fulfill the plan of the Father and partake of the fruits of the Atonement only by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith.

The revelations poured out upon Joseph Smith affirm that he was a prophet of God. Let's just look at some of them—just look at some of the light and truth revealed through him that shines in stark contrast to the common beliefs of his day and ours:

* God is a personal, exalted being, an Eternal Father. He is our Father.
* God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are separate beings.5
* You are more than human. You are a child of God the Eternal Father and may become like Him6 if you will have faith in His Son, repent, receive ordinances, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end.7
* The Church of Jesus Christ today is fundamentally the same Church He organized during His mortal ministry, with prophets and apostles, Melchizedek and Levitical Priesthoods, elders, high priests, deacons, teachers, bishops, and the seventy, all as described in the Bible.
* Priesthood authority was withheld from the earth following the deaths of the Savior and His Apostles and was restored again in our day.
* Revelation has not ceased, and the heavens are not closed. God speaks to prophets today, and He will speak to you and me as well.8
* There is more after this life than only heaven and hell. There are degrees of glory, and it matters a great deal what we do in this life.9
* More than having a mere passive belief in Christ, we should ""look unto [Him] in every thought,""10 ""do all that [we do] in the name of the Son,""11 and ""always remember him and keep his commandments … that [we] may always have his Spirit to be with [us].""12
* The billions who live and die without the gospel and the ordinances necessary for salvation are not lost. ""Through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel,""13 administered for both the living and the dead.14
* Everything did not begin at birth. You lived before in the presence of God as His son or daughter and prepared for this mortal life.15",0.0

He chose a young man named Joseph Smith to learn about the eternal plan of salvation. Joseph was confused about the different religions in his community, but the scriptures led him to ask God what he should do.7 In answer to his prayer, God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him.8 Through this and other experiences, Joseph Smith was called as a prophet, like unto Moses and other biblical prophets.9 Because Joseph saw and talked with the Savior, his work was to restore the truth about the great plan of God and the divine mission of our Lord. I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.

The Prophet Joseph received authority to teach the gospel and bring forth additional scripture. He was commanded to translate writings of ancient prophets from The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. The Book of Mormon prophets also knew about the plan of salvation and the sacred mission of Jesus Christ. The appearance of the resurrected Christ to the ancient people of the Americas is recorded in this sacred book.10 He taught them His gospel and established His Church among them. I know that the Book of Mormon is another testament of the divinity of Jesus Christ.

God has promised that the Holy Ghost will testify to each of us that sacred truths have been restored and that Joseph Smith was called by God to be a special witness of Christ and His gospel. We may come to know the truth of all things God has revealed, through the power of the Holy Ghost.11

Millions of converts to this Church initially accepted the truths proclaimed by our missionaries in the first discussion. They then opened their hearts to all the discussions taught by the missionaries. They were invited to be baptized, confirmed, become ""fellowcitizens with the saints,""12 and continue on the gospel path to additional sacred covenants made in the temple.",1.0

God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ revealed themselves to Joseph Smith in a marvelous vision. After that glorious event, Joseph Smith told a minister about it. Joseph was surprised to hear the minister say that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days, that all such things had ceased. (See JS—H 1:21.)

This remark symbolizes practically all of the objections that have ever been made against the Church by nonmembers and dissident members alike. Namely, they do not believe that God reveals his will today to the Church through prophets of God. All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage, seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation. Here, then, is a procedure to handle most objections through the use of the Book of Mormon.

First, understand the objection.

Second, give the answer from revelation.

Third, show how the correctness of the answer really depends on whether or not we have modern revelation through modern prophets.

Fourth, explain that whether or not we have modern prophets and revelation really depends on whether the Book of Mormon is true.

Therefore, the only problem the objector has to resolve for himself is whether the Book of Mormon is true. For if the Book of Mormon is true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a prophet receiving revelation.",0.0

No, these sections do not ""ban polygamy,"" and one of them, Section 101, wasn't even a revelation.

What was then D&C 13:7 in the 1835 edition is now D&C 42:22. (This link is super helpful for figuring out this kind of thing, btw.) The context of the section—again, important, and again, missing from Jeremy's commentary—shows that it's talking about adultery and fornication, not plural marriage. The entire section is talking about the laws and commandments of the newly reestablished Church, and this is referring to the law of chastity. Practicing plural marriage when commanded to is not violating the law of chastity. The commandment to cleave unto your wife and none else does not preclude another commandment telling you to have more than one wife to cleave to. If you have more than one wife, you can cleave to all of them and not be in violation of this commandment.

The 1835 D&C 65:3 is now D&C 49:15-21. This revelation was given in 1831 and was in direct response to the Shakers and their belief in abstinence and celibacy, including that all marriage was wrong. Some of the new converts to the Church were former Shakers and still held onto those old beliefs. The Lord was saying that marriage is ordained of God and that they should engage in it. In 1831, the practice of the Church was that of monogamy. That's always been the norm, even when plural marriage was in force. That is the standard by which we all live unless commanded otherwise. That command to live otherwise hadn't yet gone into effect. Joseph may have known about it at this point, but he wasn't living it yet and neither was anyone else. Again, these verses were not banning polygamy, they were giving instructions on how to marry and conduct yourselves in marriage to Saints who didn't believe in marriage, as well as pointing out other things the Shakers got wrong.",2.0

This revelation also taught that under certain conditions a man might be authorized to have more than one wife. Though the revelation was first committed to writing on July 12, 1843, considerable evidence suggests that the principle of plural marriage was revealed to Joseph Smith more than a decade before in connection with his study of the Bible (see* Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible (JST) ""Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible (JST)"")*), probably in early 1831. Passages indicating that revered Patriarchs and prophets of old were polygamists raised questions that prompted the Prophet to inquire of the Lord about marriage in general and about plurality of wives in particular. He then learned that when the Lord commanded it, as he had with the Patriarchs anciently, a man could have more than one living wife at a time and not be condemned for adultery. He also understood that the Church would one day be required to live the law (* D&C 132*:1-4, 28-40).*

Evidence for the practice of plural marriage during the 1830s is scant. Only a few knew about the still unwritten revelation, and perhaps the only known plural marriage was that between Joseph Smith and Fanny Alger. Nonetheless there were rumors, harbingers of challenges to come.",3.0

Jacob taught, ""David and Solomon had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord"" (Jacob 2:24). In the same discourse, Jacob established that monogamous marriage was the rule in God's kingdom, while plural marriage was an exception granted under unusual circumstances. He specified:

From a reading of the entire scriptural canon, it appears that plural marriage is an exception and not the general rule concerning marriage relationships on earth and in the eternities. When the question of plural marriage was raised among the Nephites, Jacob condemned the practice but also noted the Lord's word to him that ""if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things"" (Jacob 2:30). This verse allows for righteous men, such as the biblical patriarch Jacob (Israel), Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and others to practice plural marriage when it is commanded, but for most of the history of the Church, monogamous marriages have been the common practice among the Saints.

Many Church members struggled to accept the revelation to end plural marriage. Church leaders worked to help the Saints understand the change and were gentle in their treatment of those who struggled with the Manifesto. Official Declaration 1 proclaimed that President Woodruff's ""advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land"" (Official Declaration 1). It left open the question of whether the practice might continue in countries, such as Mexico, where no laws existed that prohibited plural marriage.",3.0

I have thought for many years that the connections between man and wife were as sacred as the heavens and ought to be treated as such, and I thought that the anointed of the Lord would not get more wives unless they were commanded to do so. But still I wanted a knowledge of the truth for myself. I asked my husband if he did not think we could get a revelation for ourselves on that subject. He said he did not know. After we went to bed I lay pondering it over in my mind. I said, ""You know, Lord, that I have been a faithful and true wife to my husband, and you know how much I love him, and must I sacrifice him?"" The answer was, ""No.""*
>
>
> ***And then my mind was carried away from the earth and I had a view of the order of the celestial kingdom. I saw that was the order there and oh, how beautiful. I was filled with love and joy that was unspeakable****. I awoke my husband and told him of the views I had and that the ordinance was from the Lord, but it would damn thousands. It was too sacred for fools to handle, for they would use it to gratify their lustful desires. How thankful we ought to be that we live in a day when we can know the will of God concerning our duty, and that the darkness that has so long covered the earth has been dispelled and the light of truth has burst upon the benighted world. But what good will this do those who will not come to the light because their deeds are evil, and they choose darkness rather than light. But the honest in heart that seek the Lord in faith will obtain all the knowledge needful for their salvation. I have seen so much wrong connected with this ordinance that **had I not had it revealed to me from Him that cannot lie, I should sometimes have doubted the truth of it, but there has never a doubt crossed my mind concerning the truth of it since the Lord made it known to me by a heavenly vision**.*

Jacob delivered a condemnatory speech at the temple where he chastised the Nephites for their ""wickedness and abominations"" (Jacob 2:10), specifically their pride (Jacob 2:13, 16, 20, 22), materialism (Jacob 2:13, 17–19), and sexual immorality (Jacob 2:23–35).

Concerning their ""whoredoms"" (Jacob 2:23, 28, 33), Jacob specifically mentioned unauthorized polygamy as an iniquitous practice. ""Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord. . . . Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old"" (Jacob 2:24, 26). Jacob therefore categorized such unauthorized instances of polygyny and concubinage (a man marrying multiple women), as sinful, for, he said, God ""delight[s] in the chastity of women"" (Jacob 2:28), and would not tolerate lascivious men abusing women (Jacob 2:32–33).

That being the general rule, Jacob went on to qualify that law, saying that plural marriage is justifiable but only when God commands it. ""Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes. For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things"" (Jacob 2:29–30). As Latter-day Saint researcher Brian Hales commented, ""The Nephite prophet Jacob reiterates a commandment given to his father Lehi establishing monogamy as the rule and polygamy as only a divinely commanded exception.""1, 3:193."")",3.0

Joseph Smith did not leave a personal statement of his motivation, but his friends repeated his motivation multiple times: he believed it was a direct commandment from God. It was also referred to explicitly as a commandment in the Doctrine and Covenants.

Therefore, the question in this case is likely not what his motivation was. It should be whether or not you believe him when you hear his motivation.

As I said above, this is a question I took directly to Heavenly Father. I put aside my personal assumptions and I asked Him if it was a commandment from Him, and if it was, to open my mind and give me understanding and insight as to *why* it was a commandment. Because I did that, I can say that yes, I believe Joseph when I hear what his motivation was, according to those who knew him and the revelation he received.

The idea that he did it for reasons of lust isn't borne out by the evidence. There isn't any evidence of sexual relations in most of his unions, and the ones that do have evidence show that it happened rarely.",3.0

The teachings of Christ must be embedded in our desire to choose the right and in our wish to find happiness. His righteous life must be reflected in our own actions. The Lord not only teaches love, He *is* love. He not only preached the importance of faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, He *lived* accordingly. His life reflected the gospel that He preached. There was and is total harmony between His thoughts and His actions.

I believe that if we want to be true Christians, our lives must be founded on true principles and our actions must reflect that. But I do not believe that we can pick and choose which principles are the most convenient ones. Today, however, I would like to mention those that are true to my heart and that have helped me in my quest to take the Christian course.

When a man asked Christ what he should do to inherit eternal life, He answered, ""Love the Lord thy God … and thy neighbour as thyself."" (Luke 10:27.) Love is the essence of the gospel and the guiding light for a Christlike life. It not only teaches us to look upward but also to look around us. Our heart, might, and mind must be dedicated to the Lord and to our fellow men, women, and children. But what does that really mean? It means that we follow the admonition of the scripture, ""If ye love me, keep my commandments."" (John 14:15.) It means that we live the example of the good Samaritan, who was free of prejudice and excuses and therefore truly loved his neighbor. He went the second mile and gave of what he had despite all the odds. His life was one of single-minded service.",0.0

Important temporal and spiritual choices should not only be based on personal preference or what is convenient or popular.23 The Lord is **not** saying, ""Do whatever you want.""

He is saying, ""Come, follow me.""24

2. The ministry of Christ in the spirit world was for the benefit of those who had died without hearing the gospel or the fulness of it (1 Pet. 4:6; see Salvation of the Dead).

3. Such baptisms are to be performed in temple fonts dedicated to the purpose (*TPJS*, p. 308; cf. D&C 124:29-35). In November 1841 the font in the unfinished Nauvoo Temple was so dedicated.

4. The language of the baptismal prayer is the same as for the living, with the addition of ""for and in behalf of"" the deceased.

5. Witnesses are to be present for proxy baptisms and a record is to be kept in Church archives (D&C 128:3, 8).

6. Women are to be baptized for women and men for men.

7. Not only baptism but confirmation and the higher temple ordinances may also be performed by proxy (*TPJS*, pp. 362-63).

8. The law of agency is inviolate in this world and the world to come. Thus, those served by proxy have the right to accept or reject the ordinances.

In the early years of the Church, proxy baptisms were performed only for direct blood ancestors, usually no more than four generations back. Today, Latter-day Saints are baptized not only for their own forebears but also for other persons, unrelated to them, identified through the name extraction program. The practice reflects the yearning of children for their parents and of parents for their children, and charitable feelings for others as well, that they receive the fulness of the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

In modern times, this ordinance and the authority to perform it has been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith and is performed in temples throughout the world. Baptism and other essential, saving ordinances are performed for those who were unable or unwilling to accept them in this life but might do so on the other side of the veil so they, too, might ""live according to God in the spirit"" (1 Peter 4:6).

The first public affirmation of the ordinance of baptism for the dead in the Church was Joseph Smith's funeral sermon for Seymour Brunson in Nauvoo in August 1840.

Jesus taught that all must be baptized to enter heaven, the problem is that there are millions of God's children who never have even heard the name of Jesus, yet alone had the opportunity to be baptized. According to many churches, these people will be condemned for the eternities because of something that is completely out of their control, that of learning about and accepting Christ through baptism.

We believe that God is a merciful God. Because he loves all of his children, he created a plan for those who never have had the opportunity to accept Jesus Christ and be baptized in this life. Those who die before hearing the gospel will have the chance to hear about Christ after they have died. These children of God will then have the chance to accept or reject the message of the Savior, and then those on the earth can be baptized for and in behalf of them in temples of the Lord. The baptism is only valid if the deceased person accepts the ordinance. The act of baptism for the dead is an act of compassion, not a way to force someone to believe. It is God's way of allowing all to be baptized and to receive the blessings of the gospel, even if they have never had the opportunity in this life.",2.0

Smith witnessed in vision that the Savior visited the spirit world and ""from among the righteous [spirits] … organized his forces and appointed messengers, clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness. …

""These were taught faith in God, repentance from sin, vicarious baptism for the remission of sins, [and] the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.""5

The doctrine that the living can provide baptism and other essential ordinances to the dead, vicariously, was revealed anew to the Prophet Joseph Smith.6 He learned that the spirits awaiting resurrection are not only offered individual salvation but that they can be bound in heaven as husband and wife and be sealed to their fathers and mothers of all generations past and have sealed to them their children of all generations future. The Lord instructed the Prophet that these sacred rites are appropriately performed only in a house built to His name, a temple.7

The principle of vicarious service should not seem strange to any Christian. In the baptism of a living person, the officiator acts, by proxy, in place of the Savior. And is it not the central tenet of our faith that Christ's sacrifice atones for our sins by vicariously satisfying the demands of justice for us? As President Gordon B. Hinckley has expressed: ""I think that vicarious work for the dead more nearly approaches the vicarious sacrifice of the Savior Himself than any other work of which I know. It is given with love, without hope of compensation, or repayment or anything of the kind. What a glorious principle.""8",3.0

When Clement, as an investigator, asked Peter, ""If those shall enjoy the kingdom of Christ, whom His coming shall find righteous, shall then those be wholly deprived of the kingdom who have died before His coming?"" Peter with reticence described the sacred nature of ordinances for the dead: ""You compel me, O Clement, to touch upon things that are unspeakable.

Regarding this principle, Paulsen et al., ""Baptism for the Dead,"" 31, note: ""Paul's failure to openly condemn the practice was in effect an endorsement of the same. It has been asserted that Paul's lack of condemnation on the subject has a parallel to Paul's initial unwillingness to condemn the practice of eating meat sacrificed to idols (1 Corinthians 8:10). But the parallel is weak, since Paul does state explicitly later in the same epistle that such a practice is inherently wrong (1 Corinthians 10:21). We do not find that in respect to baptisms for the dead."""") In this masterful letter to friends he had lived with for a year and a half, Paul corrected many incorrect beliefs and practices that had crept into the fledgling branch of the Church there, including some incorrect beliefs about the Resurrection. Paul emphasized that like Christ, everyone would be resurrected into a kingdom of glory. In this context, Paul is using baptisms for the dead to ultimately strengthen his argument in favor of the resurrection of the dead—showing that he understood and approved of the practice. Baptism is still a requirement to enter the kingdom of heaven (see John 3:5), and those who died without being able to receive this ordinance would then depend on living individuals to perform these ordinances as a proxy for them.",3.0

For example, in the *Apocalypse of Peter* the Lord declared regarding the dead, ""I will give to my called and my elect whomever they request of me from out of punishment. And I will give them a beautiful baptism in salvation … a share in righteousness with my saints.""7 In other words, the righteous Saints could request that salvation be shared with dead sinners, who would then be saved through baptism. Similarly, the *Shepherd of Hermas*, which was written only about forty years after Paul wrote 1 Corinthians and contained many quotations from early Christian scripture, describes how ""apostles and teachers who preached the name of the Son of God"" preached the Gospel to the living and the dead. Furthermore, these same Apostles and teachers ""descended with [the dead] into the water, and again ascended. But these descended alive and rose up again alive; whereas they who had previously fallen asleep descended dead, but rose up again alive.""8, 238. Archbishop Hilarion Alfeyev of the Eastern Orthodox faith has likewise noted that this verse is often understood in the context of proxy baptisms in Metropolitan Hilarion Alfeyev, Christ the Conqueror of Hell: The Descent into Hades from an Orthodox Perspective (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 2009), 25n33."") John A. Tvedtnes has likewise noted that baptisms for the dead have played a significant role in the texts and ordinances of the Coptic Orthodox Church.9, 67–71; John A.

Peterson has observed that ""several logical fallacies exist"" in such an approach, especially regarding other ordinances such as the sacrament that were likewise accepted by these sects as well as the orthodox church.18, 395–431; and D. Jill Kirby, ""Living in the Afterlife: Heaven, Hell, and Places Between,"" in Ancient Christians, 392–449."")

After regarding these later theological developments, Krister Stendahl, the late Bishop of Stockholm for the Church of Sweden, noted: ""Once the theological pressures from later possible developments of practice and doctrine are felt less constricting, the text [1 Corinthians 15:29] seems to speak plainly enough about a practice within the Church of vicarious baptism for the dead.""19, 1:97.

Col. 1:24).

Such a connection may be conscious or unconscious. In either case it makes it quite reasonable that Paul's remark refers to a practice of a vicarious baptism for the dead.

Seeing a widow in the congregation who had recently lost a son before he could be baptized, Joseph Smith introduced one of the most significant doctrines of the Restoration: baptisms for the dead.1: 41."") This ordinance would be the theme of many of Joseph's revelations, letters, and discourses during the following months, especially as the Nauvoo Temple was being constructed.2

As biblical evidence that this ordinance was performed in ancient Christianity, Joseph Smith turned to 1 Corinthians 15:29: ""Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?""3 This verse constitutes the only explicit reference to this ordinance for the deceased in the New Testament, and it has led many modern scholars to wonder what Paul might have been referring to and whether proxy baptisms were actually performed in antiquity. As additional texts have come to light, however, most scholars today conclude that the clearest reading of this verse states that early Christians actually performed vicarious ordinances for the dead.

For example, after reviewing attempts to interpret this passage as referring to a metaphor or a regular baptism, one scholar concluded that ""all interpretations which seek to evade vicarious baptism for the dead … are misleading.""4, 1:542n63."") Similarly, Reginald St. John Parry noted that ""the plain and necessary sense of the words implies the existence of a practice of vicarious baptism at Corinth, presumably on behalf of believers who died before they were baptised. … Many attempts have been made to evade this conclusion, but all at the cost of violence to the language. … In fact, all such evasions are wholly due to the unwillingness to admit such a practice, and still more such a reference to it by S.

As regards the Resurrection, Paul asked, ""Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not … ? why are they then baptized for the dead?""13 We are baptized for the dead because we know that they will rise. ""The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.""14 ""For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.""15

It matters tremendously what we do in relation to those who have gone before, because they live today as spirits and shall live again as immortal souls, and that because of Jesus Christ. We believe His words when He said, ""I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.""16 By the baptisms we perform in behalf of the dead, we testify that ""as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. …

Tonight I would like to speak about missionary service. I direct my comments to the vast army of young men who hold the Aaronic Priesthood who are gathered throughout the entire world and to their fathers, grandfathers, and priesthood leaders who watch over them.

Missionary work is a subject very close to my heart, as it is to every member of the eight Quorums of the Seventy, whom the Lord has appointed to go ""before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.""1 Missionary work is the lifeblood of the Church and the lifesaving blessing to all who accept its message.",1.0

Thirty-five years after I served my first mission, I received a letter from a family whom I had taught but did not baptize. The letter shared that their family of four little children whom I once knew now consisted of four temple marriages, three full-time missionaries, three bishops, a Relief Society president, and a dozen grandchildren maturing and developing in the gospel. You can well imagine the thrill and joy I received knowing that I had helped to find them and to teach them the gospel of Jesus Christ.

In conclusion, may I testify of the blessings of missionary service. Last year, my father passed away at age 88. As a young man, he was called on a mission during the Depression, when few were able to serve. It was hard and difficult. He always said that his decision to serve a mission was the best decision he ever made. When he died, he left 10 children, 9 living; 56 grandchildren; and 116 great-grandchildren. Of his posterity, 32 served full-time missions and 15 spouses who married into the family had served missions, resulting in 47 full-time missionaries or almost 100 years of full-time missionary work. All of this resulted, in part, because one man served a mission. I shall be forever grateful that my father served a mission and that I was motivated and taught to follow his example.

I bear witness of this great privilege we all have in the Church—to be missionaries. Inherent in our responsibility of holding the priesthood is to be a missionary. I pray that we will all fulfill that obligation we have to the Lord. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",2.0

Finally, I asked one of my finest missionaries to become his companion, urging him to do all he could to help his fellow missionary love his work. As I approached a conference in the city where they were laboring, I feared he, like his predecessors, would ask for a transfer.

We are missionaries every day in our families, in our schools, in our places of employment, and in our communities. Regardless of our age, experience, or station in life, we are all missionaries.

Proclaiming the gospel is not an activity in which we periodically and temporarily engage. And our labors as missionaries certainly are not confined to the short period of time devoted to full-time missionary service in our youth or in our mature years. Rather, the obligation to proclaim the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is inherent in the oath and covenant of the priesthood into which we enter. Missionary work essentially is a priesthood responsibility, and all of us who hold the priesthood are the Lord's authorized servants on the earth and are missionaries at all times and in all places—and we always will be. Our very identity as holders of the priesthood and the seed of Abraham is in large measure defined by the responsibility to proclaim the gospel.

Parents, families, friends, and donors to the General Missionary Fund may also assist. All missionaries, younger and older, serve with the sole hope of making life better for other people.

The decision to serve a mission will shape the spiritual destiny of the missionary, his or her spouse, and their posterity for generations to come. A desire to serve is a natural outcome of one's conversion, worthiness, and preparation.

Our young missionaries set aside their education, occupation, dating, and whatever else young adults would typically be doing at this stage of life. For 18 to 24 months they put it all on hold because of their deep desire to serve the Lord.2 And some of our missionaries serve in their more mature years of life. I know their families are blessed.

Eight men were called as General Authorities. Six women were called to the presidencies of the Relief Society and Young Women. Over two hundred men were called to serve as bishops, and over seventeen hundred men and women were called as full-time missionaries. In that same month, tens of thousands of others were called as officers and teachers and other workers in the many Church organizations throughout the world. Those called in April joined millions of others already serving in similar capacities in the restored Church.

As I contemplated my own calling and the callings of millions of others already in service, I was led to consider this question: Why do we serve?

Service is an imperative for those who worship Jesus Christ. To followers who were vying for prominent positions in his kingdom, the Savior taught, ""Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant."" (Matt. 20:27.) On a later occasion, he spoke of ministering to the needs of the hungry, the naked, the sick, and the imprisoned. He concluded that teaching with these words: ""Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."" (Matt. 25:40.)",1.0

Missionary work results in many rejections. It is easy to be discouraged. ""And ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect; for mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts.""6

Third, be obedient, faithful, and true. Missionaries serve in companionships for protection. A missionary best protects his companion when he is loyal to the Lord and helps his companion. By keeping the missionary rules, you gain the freedom of having the Spirit assist you.

Fourth, teach and testify. ""And ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two, in my name, lifting up your voices as with the sound of a trump, declaring my word like unto angels of God.""7",2.0

As the Apostle Paul said, we that are strong enough to bear the infirmities of the weak should not do so ""to please ourselves."" (Rom. 15:1.) Reasons aimed at earthly rewards are distinctly lesser in character and reward than the other reasons I will discuss.

Some may serve out of fear of punishment. The scriptures abound with descriptions of the miserable state of those who fail to follow the commandments of God. Thus, King Benjamin taught his people that the soul of the unrepentant transgressor would be filled with ""a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.""

As you prayerfully seek and cultivate missionary opportunities in your daily activities, you will find many ways to serve. They include helping to find, convert, and retain new members. The stake or full-time missionaries can teach you how to do that.

You can help the full-time and stake missionaries bring new investigators to church and make them feel comfortable. Let them know that they have a new friend. Strengthen that friendship by inviting them to your home or to Church activities with you. You can support them in obeying the commandments. Such valuable missionary service is not difficult because it can be carried out in the normal routine of your daily life.

There are other ways you may not think of as missionary service. For example, a young mother can teach each growing son to prepare to be a missionary to preach the gospel and to share his testimony of truth. As mother and father cultivate that thought throughout his growing years, he will be a missionary. That is excellent missionary service.",2.0

These are those I would call the good soldiers, who instinctively do what they are asked without question and sometimes without giving much thought to the reasons for their service. Such persons fill the ranks of voluntary organizations everywhere, and they do much good. We have all benefited by the good works of such persons. Those who serve out of a sense of duty or loyalty to various wholesome causes are the good and honorable men and women of the earth.

Service of the character I have just described is worthy of praise and will surely qualify for blessings, especially if it is done willingly and joyfully. As the Apostle Paul wrote in his second letter to the Corinthians:

""But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

""Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver."" (2 Cor. 9:6–7.)

People serve one another for different reasons, and some reasons are better than others. Perhaps none of us serves in every capacity all the time for only a single reason. Since we are imperfect beings, most of us probably serve for a combination of reasons, and the combinations may be different from time to time as we grow spiritually. But we should all strive to serve for the reasons that are highest and best.

What are some of the reasons for service? By way of illustration, and without pretending to be exhaustive, I will suggest six reasons. I will discuss these in ascending order from the lesser to the greater reasons for service.

Some may serve for hope of earthly reward.

**WHO ARE CALLED.** In the first generation of the Church, married men frequently were called to be missionaries, and they left wives and families for an indeterminate length of time. In recent decades, the majority of missionaries have been young men and women who serve about two years.

Currently, the Church calls as missionaries, on a voluntary, temporary basis, single men from the ages of nineteen to twenty-six, single women twenty-one years and older, and older married couples with no dependent children. Missionary service is coordinated with military service as required.

Missionaries or their families generally cover the major costs of serving a mission. Missionaries called from developing nations may receive needed financial assistance from the general missionary fund of the Church. This assistance covers only basic living costs, as the Church has no paid ministry. No one is paid for missionary service.",3.0

There are also a wide variety of other part-time service opportunities in almost every branch of Church activity, such as the temple, family history, welfare, education, and public affairs.

He said, ""I don't want to go."" I asked, ""What has that got to do with it? We need you.""

President Kimball has said we don't have *half enough* missionaries. Can't you see that it doesn't matter whether you want to go or not? You're needed! Do you know what it means to be needed? The bonds of brotherhood are forged deep and strong in the mission field. You will develop a love for a companion with whom you kneel in daily prayer. You will learn to love the people where you serve, no matter what nationality or condition. And they will love you. They will love you because you brought them the gospel.

Converts always remember those who taught them. I've heard many converts speak almost reverently of ""our missionaries."" Imagine having people pray for you. Do you understand what that means? This will always be a purifying and refining influence in your life.

Many people out there are praying for the truth. You are the one who can bring it to them best. At present only 18,000 of you are serving. There are nearly 60,000, 19 through 25, who have not. We need more, many more. Missionary service is not preempted by any other thing. Marriage does not take precedence. Your work does not have priority. Your education is interrupted to fill this calling. College-related activities may be timed to satisfy both school and mission requirements. Some of you may be physically handicapped. There may yet be opportunity to serve in fitting ways locally.

Your moral worthiness is a prime consideration. We want no flabbiness of character when spiritual strength is required. Study! Get some colored pencils. Keep them with your Book of Mormon. Underline verses important to you. Another tool of missionary work is an additional language. Study one. We should ""become acquainted with … languages, tongues, and people."" (D&C 90:15.)",1.0

The Savior applied that principle in the Sermon on the Mount, in which he commanded us to love our enemies, bless them that curse us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them that despitefully use us and persecute us. (See Matt. 5:44.) He explained the purpose of that commandment as follows:

""For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?

""And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?"" (Matt. 5:46–47.)

This principle—that our service should be for the love of God and the love of fellowmen rather than for personal advantage or any other lesser motive—is admittedly a high standard. The Savior must have seen it so, since he joined his commandment for selfless and complete love directly with the ideal of perfection. The very next verse of the Sermon on the Mount contains this great commandment: ""Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."" (Matt. 5:48.)

This principle of service is reaffirmed in the fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants:

""Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day."" (D&C 4:2.)

We learn from this command that it is not enough to serve God with all of our *might and strength.* He who looks into our hearts and knows our minds demands more than this. In order to stand blameless before God at the last day, we must also serve him with all our *heart and mind.*

Service with all of our heart and mind is a high challenge for all of us. Such service must be free of selfish ambition. It must be motivated only by the pure love of Christ.",2.0

A missionary learns, for example, that God can use him as an instrument to accomplish His work. He can say, as did Ammon, a Book of Mormon missionary, ""This is [a] blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work."" (Alma 26:3.)

A missionary learns that he must be humble and dependent on the Lord. He learns to pray with fervor and sincerity, not only for himself but for others, and to be led and directed by the Spirit.

""And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church.""

Our missionaries could well answer in the words of Paul, that peerless missionary of an earlier day: ""For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!""5

The holy scriptures contain no proclamation more relevant, no responsibility more binding, no instruction more direct than the injunction given by the resurrected Lord as He appeared in Galilee to the eleven disciples. Said He:

They also called upon others to help them fulfill the Lord's command.

Today, under the direction of modern apostles and prophets, that same charge has been extended to missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. These missionaries serve in more than 150 nations. As representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ, they strive to fulfill that divine command—renewed in our day by the Lord Himself—to take the fulness of the gospel abroad and bless the lives of people everywhere.6

Missionaries in their late teens or early 20s are young in ways of the world. But they are blessed with gifts—such as the power of the Holy Spirit, the love of God, and testimonies of the truth—that make them powerful ambassadors of the Lord. They share the good news of the gospel that will bring true joy and everlasting happiness to all who heed their message. And in many instances they do so in a country and a language foreign to them.

Missionaries strive to follow Jesus Christ in both word and deed. They preach of Jesus Christ and of His Atonement.7 They teach of the literal Restoration of Christ's ancient Church through the Lord's first latter-day prophet, Joseph Smith.

However, all Church leaders are encouraged to focus principally on people, to feed the sheep in the Lord's flock, to know and love the members, to listen, love, and help with personal needs. ""It is the leader's duty&#133;to teach the member to love-not the leader or teacher, but the truth of the gospel"" (D. McKay, *IE* 71 [Dec. 1968]:108). To do this, leaders are frequently counseled to seek the spiritual gifts of discernment and wisdom (cf. Luke 12:12; D&C 84:85).

In addition to inspiration, leaders may look to others for training or assistance. A leader may confer with his or her own priesthood leader about a problem or need, especially in one's ""stewardship review""-a one-on-one session with one's organizational leader. These personal interviews are customarily held four times a year, ""for it is required of the Lord, at the hand of every steward, to render an account of his stewardship, both in time and in eternity"" (D&C 72:3).

First, and very important, members are given early and repeated opportunities to serve, thereby learning from experience. Beginning at age twelve, young men and women can serve as teachers for children or as members of class presidencies or of youth activities committees. In addition, teacher development courses and in-service lessons assist teachers, and leadership training meetings instruct leaders of various organizations. Manuals and handbooks outline the responsibilities of individuals serving in different organizations at both ward and stake levels.

Lay participation and leadership have several implications for the Church and its members. Part of the mission of the Church is to perfect the Saints (Eph. 4:12), to sponsor growth in individual members. Utilizing volunteer members at all levels of the organization may not ensure peak efficiency, but it does provide the experiences and interactions that will help members progress. Volunteer staffing also means that in most of the callings members work part-time and that this service is in addition to regular employment and other responsibilities. This provides the opportunity for learning to sacrifice and to balance commitments. In general, members who serve maintain a high level of commitment to the Church, in part because of their awareness that they are responsible for making a contribution and because they take satisfaction from doing so. Because professional training is not required, lay leadership lessens the sense of hierarchy and increases feelings of unity. The children's music leader may have more formal education than the bishop. After being released in a few years, that bishop may serve as children's music leader. Opportunities to serve in a variety of callings and to be served by people in different capacities can increase the sense of brotherhood and sisterhood shared by Church members.",0.0

The Book of Mormon provides adequate instructions for baptism and proper words for the baptismal prayer (3 Ne. 11:23-28; Moro. 6:1-4; cf. D&C 20:73).

In addition to relying on information in the Book of Mormon, Latter-day Saints follow the New Testament teachings on baptism. Jesus taught that baptism is necessary for salvation. He told Nicodemus, ""Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God"" (John 3:1-5). He required baptism of those who professed to become his disciples (John 4:1-2). His farewell commission to his apostles was that they should go to all nations, teaching and baptizing (Matt. 28:19), and he declared, ""He that believeth *and is baptized* shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned"" (Mark 16:16; emphasis added). Paul, after his miraculous vision on the road to Damascus, was taught the gospel by Ananias who told him to ""arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins"" (Acts 22:16). To the penitent multitude on the day of Pentecost, Peter proclaimed, ""Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins"" (Acts 2:38).

Latter-day Saints do not accept baptismal practices and teachings that arose among some Christian groups in the centuries after the death of the apostles, including infant baptism, baptism by means other than immersion, and the idea that baptism is not necessary for salvation. The Nephite prophet Mormon denounced the practice of infant baptism, which had apparently crept in among his people, and declared that anyone who supposed that little children need baptism would deny the mercies of Christ, setting at naught the value of his Atonement and the power of his redemption (Moro. 8:4-20).",2.0

Reynolds, an emeritus professor of Political Science at BYU and former director of the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), highlighted the fact that the New Testament uses two different metaphors for what the act of baptism represents. The first is the idea of purification, or the washing away of sins, as can be seen in Acts 22:15–16. The second is the idea that it is a representation of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, as introduced by Paul (Romans 6:4).1: 5. "")

The Book of Mormon has a third, and very important, metaphor of the main purpose of baptism. Reynolds demonstrates that for Nephi and subsequent Book of Mormon figures, baptism principally serves as an outward sign or open witness of one's repentance and commitment to follow Jesus Christ.2 Instead of cleansing from sin, Reynolds notes, ""the Book of Mormon consistently points to a different symbolism: the making of a covenant.""3 The cleansing then comes by the purifying fire of the Holy Ghost (3 Nephi 12:2).

This distinction is of great importance and clarifies a doctrine that Christ, in the New Testament, declared to be essential for entrance into the kingdom of God (John 3:5; 1 Peter 3:21). As LDS scholar Craig Ostler has also argued, although the baptism of Jesus is the ""first common topic"" in the four Gospels, ""the importance of baptism as an ordinance of the gospel of Jesus Christ and an understanding of why baptism is given such a place of importance are not generally as familiar."" He also rightly notes that ""the Book of Mormon clarifies the covenant nature of baptism.""4, 144."")",0.0

(1 Nephi 13:26),"" KnoWhy 15 (January 20, 2016)."") The teachings contained in the Book of Mormon regarding the purpose of baptism are unique and exceptional in all of ancient scripture for their clarity, specificity and consistency. In contrast to biblical descriptions of baptism, the Book of Mormon provides profound insight into the covenantal nature of this ordinance, what the individual is signaling to God when he or she chooses to be baptized, and the way in which God responds to the believer's commitment.

Furthermore, the Book of Mormon demonstrates how the act of baptism fits into the larger picture of the ""doctrine"" and ""gospel"" of Christ. One may be led to assume, without the teachings contained in the Book of Mormon, that the act of baptism, on its own, can provide the believer with a remission of sins. However, the teachings of the Book of Mormon indicate that baptism is one part of an organic whole that includes faith, repentance, baptism, the reception of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. The text makes clear that baptism without repentance or the purifying effect of the Holy Ghost is not enough to wash away sins. As Noel Reynolds noted:

> A surprising implication of this Book of Mormon language is that the covenant the convert signals at baptism is actually made before baptism and is the central element of repentance. Genuine repentance always includes a deliberate commitment by the penitent person to turn to Christ and walk in his path—taking his name upon oneself and keeping his commandments. Baptism and repentance are thus linked together: baptism completes repentance.

As 2 Nephi 31:7 states, ""But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments."" In fact, in the ancient world, the swearing of an oath, the bearing of a testimony in court, or the making of a contract or covenant was often accompanied by outward gestures, submission to an ordeal, and the invocation of the name of the god who would attest to its enforcement.

Subsequent narratives regarding the ordinance of baptism in the Book of Mormon decisively follow this precedent. When Alma baptizes his followers at the waters of Mormon, he emphasizes the fact that their baptism serves ""as a witness before [God] that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you"" (Mosiah 18:10). The first baptism he performs, for the man Helam, includes the words: ""I baptize thee … as a testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until you are dead"" (Mosaiah 18:13).",3.0

Whitney taught: ""Baptism is twofold, and has a double mission to perform. It not only cleanses—it [illuminates] the soul, making manifest the things of God, past, present, future, and imparting a sure testimony of the Truth. The soul, cleansed of sin, is in a condition to enjoy the abiding influence of the Holy Ghost, which 'dwelleth not in unclean tabernacles.' Water baptism begins the work of purification and enlightenment. Spirit baptism completes it"" (*Baptism—The Birth of Water and of Spirit* [n.d.], 10).

The ordinance of baptism by water and fire is described as a gate by Nephi (see 2 Nephi 31:17). Why is baptism a gate? Because it is an ordinance denoting entry into a sacred and binding covenant between God and man. Men promise to forsake the world, love and serve their fellowmen, visit the fatherless and the widows in their afflictions, proclaim peace, preach the gospel, serve the Lord, and keep His commandments. The Lord promises to ""pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon [us]"" (Mosiah 18:10), redeem His Saints both temporally and spiritually, number them with those of the First Resurrection, and offer life eternal. Baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost are the prescribed ways to enter the strait and narrow path to eternal life.

According to the Apostle Paul, baptism also denotes our descent into a watery grave from which we are raised with ""newness of life"" (Romans 6:4) in Christ. The ordinance of baptism symbolizes Christ's death and Resurrection—we die with Him so we can live with Him. In this sense baptism is the first saving ordinance, and receiving the Holy Ghost helps each of us press forward and endure to the end.",1.0

Repentance. The centrality of faith is emphasized by the way the gospel is presented in the Book of Mormon, with faith usually mentioned in the center and the call to repentance at the first. Individuals must forsake their sins and offer up ""a sacrifice&#133;[of] a broken heart and a contrite spirit."" This requires that the sinner come down into the depths of humility and become ""as a little child"" (3 Ne. 9:20-22).

3. Baptism. The gospel emphasizes the absolute need for baptism for those accountable and capable of sin. Like repentance, baptism is also a commandment, and candidates for salvation must be baptized in order to obey the commandment (see 2 Ne. 31:6-7).

This essential ordinance is a witness to the Father that the repentant individual has covenanted with God to keep his commandments and has taken upon himself or herself the name of Christ. Faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and baptism are the gate by which one enters into the way that leads to eternal life (2 Ne. 31:13-15). Because infants are incapable of sin or of making such covenants, parents are instructed to prepare them for baptism by the time they reach eight years of age, the age of accountability established in revelation (D&C 68:25-28; see Infant Baptism).

4. The Holy Ghost. While water baptism symbolizes purification and rising from death to life, the actual cleansing or remission of sins comes by obedience, and as a gift from God ""by fire and by the Holy Ghost"" (2 Ne. 31:17; Matt. 3:11), by which the individual is born of God, having become a ""new creature"" (Mosiah 27:24-26; 1 Pet. 1:23). This spiritual experience is a witness from the Father and the Son that the sacrifice of the penitent has been accepted. After Jesus had taught the Nephites and they were baptized, ""the Holy Ghost did fall upon them, and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and with fire"" (3 Ne. 19:13; cf. Acts 2:4).",3.0

In the ordinances of baptism and the sacrament, we covenant to keep the commandments of the Father and the Son, always remember Christ, and be willing to take Christ's name (or His work and attributes36) upon us.37 The Savior, in return, covenants to forgive, or remit, our sins38 and ""pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon [us].""39 Christ also promises to prepare us for eternal life by helping us become like Him.40

No other book of ancient scripture makes this point as clearly.

Alma and his people, wherever they were, made finding sources of ""pure water"" a priority (Mosiah 23:4). This suggests that Alma and his people recognized how important baptism and spiritual purity would be in building up the Church of Christ in their new land.

What may not be immediately clear to readers is that Alma's description of the baptismal covenant is tied into the atonement of Jesus Christ—in that he asked recent converts to imitate Christ's perfect love—charity. Such ""love"" is reflected in the Egyptian meaning of *Mormon*, and is also at the heart of what it means to be a Latter-day Saint—or ""Mormon,"" as some might say. Alma asks his followers to, like Christ, love one another by suffering vicariously the pains of others and having compassion on those who are in need of help and comfort. This is what the Savior does for us, and what we commit to do for others.5, 362."")

Likewise, excommunicants undergo baptism again once they have qualified for readmission into the Church.

The form of the ordinance is prescribed in latter-day revelation, which makes clear that the baptism must be performed by a person who has priesthood authority and that it requires completely immersing the penitent candidate below the water and then bringing the person out of the water (3 Ne. 11:25-26; D&C 20:72-74). Baptism is followed by the laying-on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.

Contemporary Church practice provides for the candidate to be interviewed and approved by an authorized priesthood official (usually the bishop or other officer presiding over the congregation or a mission official), who determines whether the applicant meets the qualifying conditions of repentance, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and an understanding of and willingness to obey the laws and ordinances of the gospel. It is also necessary that an official record of each baptism be kept by the Church.

Baptism may be performed in the font provided in many meetinghouses or in any body of water that is suitable for the sacred occasion and deep enough for complete immersion. The candidate and the person performing the ordinance will be dressed in plain and modest white clothing. The ceremony is unpretentious, typically attended by the candidate's family, close friends, and interested members of the congregation. A speaker or two may offer a few words of instruction and joyous welcome to the candidate.

The earlier practice of rebaptism to manifest repentance and recommitment, or for a restoration of health in time of sickness, is no longer practiced in the Church.",1.0

In the Book of Mormon, Nephi, the son of Lehi clarifies what it meant for Jesus to ""fulfill all righteousness."" Nephi explained that even though Jesus was perfect, by being baptized He ""showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments."" (2 Nephi 31:7).

Jesus did not need a remission of his sins because he was without sin, but by being baptized, he showed his humility, and willingly made a sacred covenant to do the will of His Father. In this way, He showed us what our Heavenly Father wants all of us to do.

In addition to teaching us why Jesus needed to be baptized, The Book of Mormon also plainly and distinctively teaches that baptism is a sacred witness and covenant that we make with God, that we are willing to trust in our Savior, and keep his commandments. Being submerged symbolizes the burial of our old selves. Coming up out of the water represents our being raised up into a new stage of life as we promise to follow our Savior.

Baptism puts believers on the covenant path and is an outward sign of our commitment to Heavenly Father. This unique doctrine is taught many times throughout the Book of Mormon. For example, Alma taught at the Waters of Mormon that baptism serves ""as a witness before [God] that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments"" (Mosiah 18:10). Nephi, son of Nephi, also confirmed that baptism acts ""as a witness and a testimony before God"" (3 Nephi 7:25). Because of the covenantal nature of baptism, the Book of Mormon also strongly states that little children are not to be baptized.",3.0

I was eight years of age. My parents taught me and my brothers the significance of this great ordinance. My mother told me that after my baptism I would be held accountable for the things I did that were not right. I remember the day of my baptism very vividly. I was baptized in the baptismal font in the Tabernacle on Temple Square. Those who were being baptized put on white coveralls and one by one were gently taken down the steps into the water. One of the children baptized that day was not totally immersed, and so the ordinance was repeated. This was necessary because, as the scriptures indicate, ""baptism symbolizes death, burial, and resurrection, and can only be done by immersion.""1 It also follows the pattern set by the Savior, who was baptized in the river Jordan, where there was much water. As Matthew records, ""And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water.""2

Even though I was only eight years of age, the words of the baptismal prayer penetrated deeply into my soul. After repeating my name, Brother Irvin G.

In the Book of Mormon, the one baptized makes a solemn commitment to follow Christ and thereafter keep His commandments, just as the early Christian converts to whom Peter wrote had promised to do.

Previous to baptism, converts in the Book of Mormon were questioned about their desires and willingness to serve God before making that commitment. And after being baptized and receiving a remission of their sins, those baptized were expected to continue to witness before God and the people that they were truly repentant and that they sought to pattern their lives after the Savior. Both the Bible and the Book of Mormon teach the same Gospel including the importance of the baptismal covenant. This scriptural consistency with the Bible reflects Mormon's stated purposed for the Book of Mormon: it was ""written for the intent that ye may believe that [the Bible]; and if ye believe that ye will believe this [the Book of Mormon] also"" (Mormon 7:9).",3.0

In the ancient world, baptism and other rituals for cleansing were required to be done with ""pure water"" (see Hebrews 10:22; cf. Ezekiel 36:25), which is likely why Mosiah 18:5 specifies this aspect of the waters of Mormon. When Alma and his people fled from King Noah into another land, they chose their new home based on the fact that it was also ""a land of pure water"" (Mosiah 23:4).

When Alma began to baptize people, he declared that their baptism would be ""a witness before [the Lord] that ye have entered into a covenant with him"" (Mosiah 18:10,13).

Latter-day Saints value the Bible for many reasons. The Bible presents the revelations of God in several dispensations or eras, each headed by prophets. They also read and follow the Bible for the instructional and spiritual value of the events it describes. While some of the Old Testament describes the Law of Moses that Latter-day Saints believe was fulfilled with the Atonement of Christ (3 Ne. 9:17), nevertheless the Old Testament stories, commandments, ordinances, proverbs, and prophetic writings still express the basic patterns of God's will toward his children and how they should act toward him.

Latter-day Saints revere the New Testament for its account of the birth, ministry, Atonement, and resurrection of the Savior, Jesus Christ. The teachings of Jesus in the New Testament comprise the core of LDS doctrine, and their preeminence is evidenced by their frequent appearance in other LDS standard works accepted as scripture and in LDS speaking and writing.

The writings of the New Testament apostles are accepted and appreciated for their doctrine and wise and inspired counsel and for documenting the apostolic challenge of proclaiming the gospel, adhering to the original teachings of Christ, establishing the unity of the faith, and promoting the righteousness of believers in a rapidly growing Church. Latter-day Saints also find references in several letters of the early apostles of the falling away (see Apostasy) that necessitated the restoration, alerting the faithful to remain fervent and active in the faith and to stay true to the love of Jesus Christ.",3.0

(History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 4:461.)

We believe the Bible to be the word of God, but I have often asked missionaries what they would do without the Book of Mormon and modern revelation. With just the Bible, what would be their approach? The Prophet Joseph answered it. ""Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations and where is our religion? We have none."" (HC, 2:52.)

If the Book of Mormon is not true, then Joseph Smith was not a prophet of God. I testify to you that the Book of Mormon is true and that the revelations contained in the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price and other places are true and of the Lord. Our message to the world is that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that God has revealed himself to man in this dispensation and restored his gospel with all its keys and power. Nothing will be more certain to build faith and testimonies of members and touch the hearts of honest seekers for the truth than this great book.

There is a special power about the Book of Mormon. It bears a strong, silent witness of its truth as one reads it.

Parley P. Pratt stated, ""The Spirit of the Lord came upon me, while I read [The Book of Mormon], and enlightened my mind, convinced my judgment, and rivetted the truth upon my understanding, so that I knew that the book was true, just as well as a man knows the daylight from the dark night."" (Journal of Discourses, 5:194.)

Brigham Young said as he read the book, ""I knew it was true, as well as I knew that I could see with my eyes, or feel by the touch of my fingers, or be sensible of the demonstration of any sense."" (JD, 3:91.)",3.0

These constitute the canonized, authoritative corpus of revealed writings against which all else is measured. President Joseph Fielding Smith taught, ""My words, and the teachings of any other member of the Church, high or low, if they do not square with the revelations, we need not accept them&#133;. We have accepted the four standard works as the measuring yardsticks, or balances, by which we measure every man's doctrine"" (*DS* 3:203).

While the Church views its scriptures as a canon in a strict sense, they are not viewed as closed. The doctrine of continuing revelation is one of the fundamental beliefs of the Church. As was expressed by Joseph Smith, ""We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God"" (A of F 9). While accepting ""all that God has revealed,"" whether canonized in the scriptures or not, Latter-day Saints also believe that revelation continues to enlighten their leaders. Moreover, additional divine guidance is anticipated because God ""will yet reveal many great and important things."" Those future revelations will be scripture, according to the broad definition, and it is likely that some of them will be added to the scriptures in due time.

The book of Abraham also contains teachings of Jehovah, or Christ. In chapter 3, Jehovah compares the nature of the universe to the variety of spirits, or intelligences, that inhabit the universe. Recounting God's dealings with people inhabiting the American continent, the Book of Mormon also preserves sayings given to their prophets. In addition to specific words from ""the Son"" recorded by Nephi 1 (2 Ne. 31:12, 14) and others (e.g., Moroni 2 in Ether 12:26-28), Jesus' words spoken to the people of the Western Hemisphere soon after his resurrection also appear. Besides a discourse similar to the Sermon on the Mount recorded in Matthew 5-7 (3 Ne. 12-14), the risen Jesus spoke of baptism (3 Ne. 11), the Sacrament (chap. 18), the gathering of Israel, and the helping role of the gentiles (chaps. 16, 20-21).

The Doctrine and Covenants records sayings of Christ directed to people of the contemporary world: ""Hearken, O ye people of my church,&#133;verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together,"" are words spoken in 1831 (D&C 1:1).

8 In 1842, when these articles were written, the Church accepted three books as scripture: the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the Doctrine and Covenants. In the Wentworth Letter the Prophet emphasized that the Book of Mormon was to ""be united with the Bible for the ac- complishment of the purposes of God in the last days."" Although not mentioned in this article, the Doctrine and Covenants as a book of living scripture—a book of current, ongoing reve- lation—is implicitly assumed in the next article. By naming the Book of Mormon alongside the Bible as the word of God, Joseph affirmed that the canon of scripture was open and that he was in a position by virtue of his own prophetic office to produce new scripture. As far as it is translated correctly. This article rejects the Protestant doctrine of sola scriptura, or the belief that scripture alone is sufficient for establishing doctrine and authority in the church. One of the truths the Prophet learned through his revelations and work on the ""new translation"" or revision of the Bible from 1830 to 1833 is that the Bible is on its own insufficient and suffered from errors of translation, transmission, and interpretation (all three of these concepts are assumed under the Prophet's use of the word ""translation"" in this article). As Joseph taught in an October 15, 1843, discourse, ""I believe the Bible as it ought to be, as it came from the pen of the original writers.""",0.0

It includes the Bible, the Book of Mormon (531 pages, 1981 English edition), the Doctrine and Covenants (294 pages, 1981 edition), and the Pearl of Great Price (61 pages, 1981 edition). From the outset, Latter-day Saints' commitment to the Bible and the Book of Mormon and their attempt immediately to formulate and standardize their teaching in relation to surrounding cultures made them a ""bookish"" people. By contrast, in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam the process of compiling and fixing sacred writings as ""canonical"" came comparatively long after their origins, and in each case the process resulted in a closed canon.

The Bible is accepted as the word of God by Latter-day Saints ""as far as it is translated correctly"" (A of F 8). They acknowledge that though the messages of scripture are divine in origin and impetus, the words in which they are clothed are from humans (cf. Morm. 8:16-17; Ether 12:23-27). The title page of the Book of Mormon says, ""If there are faults they are the mistakes of men."" For some such admissions strengthen rather than weaken the respect for true revelation (Stendahl, p. 100). This position avoids both the doctrine of verbal inerrancy and the naturalistic position that the Bible is a thoroughly human document, and an obsolescent one at that.",3.0

Have you ever wondered why there are so many Christian churches in the world today when they obtain their doctrines from essentially the same Bible? It is because they interpret the Bible differently. If they interpreted it the same, they would be the same church. This is not a condition the Lord desires, for the Apostle Paul declared that there is ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism"" (Ephesians 4:5). To help bring this oneness about, the Lord established a divine law of witnesses. Paul taught, ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Corinthians 13:1).

The Bible is one witness of Jesus Christ; the Book of Mormon is another. Why is this second witness so crucial? The following illustration may help: How many straight lines can you draw through a single point on a piece of paper? The answer is infinite. For a moment, suppose that single point represents the Bible and that hundreds of those straight lines drawn through that point represent different interpretations of the Bible and that each of those interpretations represents a different church.

What happens, however, if on that piece of paper there is a second point representing the Book of Mormon? How many straight lines could you draw between these two reference points: the Bible and the Book of Mormon? Only one. Only one interpretation of Christ's doctrines survives the testimony of these two witnesses.",2.0

Strong evidence besides the Book of Mormon corroborates the claims of Joseph Smith.

Members of Joseph Smith's family, who knew him best, also accepted and believed his message. Among the believers were his parents, his brothers and his sisters, and his uncle John Smith.

For example, some people are confused as to whether baptism is essential for salvation even though the Savior declared to Nicodemus, ""Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God"" (John 3:5). The Book of Mormon, however, eliminates all doubt on that subject: ""And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptized in his name, … or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God"" (2 Nephi 9:23).

There exist various modes of baptisms in the world today even though the Bible tells us the manner in which the Savior, our great Exemplar, was baptized: ""[He] went up straightway out of the water"" (Matthew 3:16). Could He have come up out of the water unless He first went down into the water? Lest there be any discord on this subject, the Book of Mormon dispels it with this straightforward statement of doctrine as to the proper manner of baptism: ""And then shall ye immerse them in the water"" (3 Nephi 11:26).",2.0

A belief in the cessation of revelation causes the doctrine that ""God is the same yesterday, today, and forever"" (Mormon 9:9) to fall; it causes the doctrine taught by Amos that ""surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets"" (Amos 3:7) to fall; and it causes the doctrine that ""God is no respecter of persons"" (Acts 10:34) and thus speaks to all men of all ages to fall.

The Bible is primarily a record of God's dealings with the forebears and descendants of Jacob or Israel in the ancient Near East. Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of God's dealings principally with another group of Israelites he brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem about 600 B.C. (see Lehi). They anticipated the birth and coming of Jesus Christ and believed in his Atonement and gospel. Their complex, lengthy records were abridged by a prophet named Mormon, inscribed on plates of gold, and buried by his son, Moroni 2, after internecine wars destroyed all of the believers in Christ in the New World except Moroni (A.D. 385).",2.0

First, it tells in a plain manner of Christ and his gospel. It testifies of his divinity and of the necessity for a Redeemer and the need of our putting trust in him. It bears witness of the Fall and the Atonement and the first principles of the gospel, including our need of a broken heart and a contrite spirit and a spiritual rebirth. It proclaims we must endure to the end in righteousness and live the moral life of a Saint.

Second, the Book of Mormon exposes the enemies of Christ. It confounds false doctrines and lays down contention. (See 2 Ne. 3:12.) It fortifies the humble followers of Christ against the evil designs, strategies, and doctrines of the devil in our day. The type of apostates in the Book of Mormon are similar to the type we have today. God, with his infinite foreknowledge, so molded the Book of Mormon that we might see the error and know how to combat false educational, political, religious, and philosophical concepts of our time.

Now God expects us to use the Book of Mormon in several ways. We are to read it ourselves—carefully, prayerfully—and ponder as we read, as to whether this book is the work of God or of an unlearned youth. And then when we are finished reading the things in the book, Moroni exhorts us to put them to the test in these words:

""And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost."" (Moro. 10:4.) I have done as Moroni exhorts, and I can testify to you that this book is from God and so is verily true.",0.0

God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ revealed themselves to Joseph Smith in a marvelous vision. After that glorious event, Joseph Smith told a minister about it. Joseph was surprised to hear the minister say that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days, that all such things had ceased. (See JS—H 1:21.)

This remark symbolizes practically all of the objections that have ever been made against the Church by nonmembers and dissident members alike. Namely, they do not believe that God reveals his will today to the Church through prophets of God. All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage, seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation. Here, then, is a procedure to handle most objections through the use of the Book of Mormon.

First, understand the objection.

Second, give the answer from revelation.

Third, show how the correctness of the answer really depends on whether or not we have modern revelation through modern prophets.

Fourth, explain that whether or not we have modern prophets and revelation really depends on whether the Book of Mormon is true.

Therefore, the only problem the objector has to resolve for himself is whether the Book of Mormon is true. For if the Book of Mormon is true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a prophet receiving revelation.",0.0

Is there a genealogical link between the ancient Canaanites and modern Africans, or is that an unfounded assumption advanced by slavery proponents and accepted by Latter-day Saints? Were blacks denied the priesthood because of an inherited curse or because people misinterpreted the Pearl of Great Price or for some other reasons? In the face of unanswered questions, the restriction created tension between these truths:

* The Lord invites all to come to him, black and white, and all of us are alike to God, beloved children (2 Ne 26:33).
* Apostles are commissioned to take the gospel to everyone.
* A race-based restriction existed.

Those co-existing facts created a theological problem. ""A contradictory and confusing legacy of racist religious folklore"" grew up to address the problem. People are black, this way of thinking went, because they chose to be less valiant in the premortal world.5 That satisfied some people, but mainly it complicated the problem.

Indeed, that is the very purpose of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—to invite, encourage, and assist all of God's children, both living and dead, to come to Christ and ""lay hold upon every good gift"" (Moro. 10:30), that ""ye may receive a remission of your sins, and be filled with the Holy Ghost, that ye may be numbered with my people who are of the house of Israel"" (3 Ne. 30:2).

That is why we do missionary work. That divine purpose explains why the risen Savior proclaimed to his chosen Apostles that they, after receiving the Holy Ghost, should be witnesses unto him ""both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth"" (Acts 1:8).

That phrase, ""unto the uttermost part of the earth,"" was very much in my mind a few weeks ago as I was privileged to accompany Elder Marvin J. Ashton of the Council of the Twelve to a great, green land I dearly love—the continent of Africa. Under authority of the holy Apostleship, Elder Ashton dedicated two west African countries—Liberia and Ivory Coast—and one in central Africa—Zaire—to the work of the Lord and the preaching of the fulness of the gospel of Christ. Those countries join others in so-called ""Black Africa,"" where the great work of bringing souls to Christ has already commenced. The time of harvest has come.

That testimony grew in my heart as a missionary when I read the New Testament and the Book of Mormon, which further bore witness of Him. That knowledge became the foundation of my life, standing on the footings of the answered prayers of my childhood.

The need for additional missionary couples to work in Africa is great, the rewards of such service sublime and eternal.

The bursting of the gospel light upon Africa is a great manifestation and testimony of God's love for all of his children. In the words of the Nephite prophet Ammon, He is ""mindful of every people, whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy are over all the earth"" (Alma 26:37).

Across Africa, to join a Sunday School, auxiliary, or priesthood class is a sacred experience, where the Church curriculum is followed and there is great gospel understanding, teaching, and learning by the Spirit.

The gospel in Africa is going to a happy people, very unencumbered by the trappings that affect the lives of many in the West. They are not concerned about having endless material possessions.

It has been said of Africans that they have very little of that which matters least and a great deal of that which matters most. They have little interest in enormous homes and the finest cars but great interest in knowing their Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, and in having eternal families. As a natural result of their faith, the Lord is lifting them in meaningful ways.

Knowing them as we do, we are not surprised that they would be such an important part of the expansion of the Church of Jesus Christ in the last days. Given that Daniel, the Old Testament prophet, envisioned the kingdom of God in the last days ""roll[ing] forth unto the ends of the earth, as [a] stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands [would] roll forth, until it [had] filled the whole earth"" (D&C 65:2), it is very fitting that our wonderful African brothers and sisters would be an important part of the fulfillment of that prophecy and that the revelations making it so would follow the Lord's established patterns.",1.0

The gospel of Jesus Christ has universal application. Since the beginning, it was designed to bless the lives of everyone, without exception. Regarding this, the Apostle Peter said, ""I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him"" (Acts 10:34–35).

President N. Eldon Tanner, who was a member of the First Presidency, taught: ""Regardless of country, clime, or condition, the gospel of Jesus Christ applies to every individual just the same. It is a way of life that each can accept, and if lived, will bring greater joy, success, and happiness than anything else in the world"" (""Christ's Worldwide Church,"" *Ensign,* July 1974, 6).

I am grateful that the gospel applies to all people, no matter where they live or what station in life they come from. I served a mission in South America more than 40 years ago, when the work was slow, even discouraging at times. Now as I return to that great continent for my present assignment, I marvel at how the Lord has blessed it and how He is making the gospel readily available to everyone, regardless of their circumstances.

As with LDS Afro-Americans, many black members outside the United States encounter contrasting circumstances of full ecclesiastical involvement, on the one hand, and general Church ignorance of their respective cultures, on the other hand. Local leaders and members (primarily white Latter-day Saints) often lack a good working knowledge of black members' needs, concerns, and circumstances. Despite the 1978 priesthood revelation and expanded missionary work among blacks, unexplored challenges to their growth and retention remain in counterpoint to their happiness with priesthood inclusion.

Despite the cultural miscommunications that remain, black Latter-day Saints enjoy opportunities in all phases of Church activity, including missionary work, quorum leadership, bishoprics, and stake presidencies, along with other members. The first entirely black African stake was organized in 1988. Indeed, black Latter-day Saints may be an LDS historical enigma that has emerged as a prime example of success in LDS brotherhood and sisterhood.

There are some of our members who may fail to reach out with friendly smiles, warm handshakes, and loving service to all of their neighbors. At the same time, there may be those who move into our neighborhoods who are not of our faith who come with negative preconceptions about the Church and its members. Surely good neighbors should put forth every effort to understand each other and to be kind to one another regardless of religion, nationality, race, or culture.

Occasionally I hear of members offending those of other faiths by overlooking them and leaving them out. This can occur especially in communities where our members are the majority. I have heard about narrow-minded parents who tell children that they cannot play with a particular child in the neighborhood simply because his or her family does not belong to our Church. This kind of behavior is not in keeping with the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. I cannot comprehend why any member of our Church would allow these kinds of things to happen. I have been a member of this Church my entire life. I have been a full-time missionary, twice a bishop, a mission president, a Seventy, and now an Apostle. I have never taught—nor have I ever heard taught—a doctrine of exclusion. I have never heard the members of this Church urged to be anything but loving, kind, tolerant, and benevolent to our friends and neighbors of other faiths.

It teaches the doctrine of Christ.5 It expands and clarifies many of the ""plain and precious""6 truths that were lost through centuries of time and numerous translations of the Bible.

The Book of Mormon provides the fullest and most authoritative understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ to be found anywhere. It teaches what it really means to be born again. From the Book of Mormon we learn about the gathering of scattered Israel. We know why we are here on earth. These and other truths are more powerfully and persuasively taught in the Book of Mormon than in any other book. The full power of the gospel of Jesus Christ is contained in the Book of Mormon. Period.

The Book of Mormon both illuminates the teachings of the Master and exposes the tactics of the adversary.7 The Book of Mormon teaches true doctrine to dispel false religious traditions—such as the erroneous practice of performing infant baptisms.8 The Book of Mormon gives purpose to life by urging us to ponder the potential of eternal life and ""never-ending happiness.""9 The Book of Mormon shatters the false beliefs that happiness can be found in wickedness10 and that individual goodness is all that is required to return to the presence of God.11 It abolishes forever the false concepts that revelation ended with the Bible and that the heavens are sealed today.

Twenty of the Book of Mormon's twenty-four references to singing deal specifically with singing praises unto the Lord.3 Its peoples sang to praise the Lord's victory after battle (3 Nephi 4:31–33); they sang to praise His power and atoning grace (Alma 5:9, 26); and they sang to emulate the angels in heaven.

Possibly the most important take away is that the Book of Mormon's music repeatedly praises the Lord for His power to deliver His people from physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual dangers. Music and song can even act as a metaphor for Christ's Atonement. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland declared that the ""most precious anthem of all [is] 'the song of redeeming love.'""15

> ""Fortunately, the seats for this particular number are limitless. […] In short, there is a place for everyone who loves God and honors His commandments as the inviolable measuring rod for personal behavior, for if love of God is the melody of our shared song, surely our common quest to obey Him is the indispensable harmony in it.""16

Regardless of anyone's musical ability, the Book of Mormon teaches that the most important song to sing is the song of Christ's redeeming love. If people embrace the Savior's Atonement and live their days singing the song of His redeeming love, the day will come when their souls—like the ""immortal spirit"" of King Benjamin—""may join the choirs above in singing the praises of a just God"" (Mosiah 2:28).

Failing to recognize these musical elements and spiritual themes leaves any performance of the Book of Mormon incomplete and inadequate, whether public or private, whether in the narrow gate or on the broad way.

The other two documents that were embarrassing were the Joseph Smith III blessing, where Joseph Smith, Jr. supposedly selected his son as his successor, and the Josiah Stowell note, which confirmed that Joseph was a treasure seeker, which was already confirmed in Joseph's original history. Hofmann said in an interview that he was confident the Church would be eager to ""buy the blessing on the spot and bury it,"" i.e. purchase and suppress. The Church did nothing of the kind and initially turned Hofmann away. Later, after negotiations with the RLDS Church to buy the JS III blessing fell through, the Church entered into a new round of discussions with Hofmann and agreed to a non-cash trade to secure the fake blessing, which they then offered at no cost to the Reorganized Church. The Church immediately made the content of the letter public.

No temple, no meetinghouse, no seminary or institute facility, no welfare facility, no building or property used in the ecclesiastical operations is under mortgage.

Question 10: *""Is the Church an organization of great wealth as some have maintained?""*

The Church has substantial assets necessary to its program. These assets are primarily in buildings. They are in ward and stake meeting facilities, in schools and seminaries, colleges and institutes. They are in welfare projects. These assets are in mission homes and missionary training centers, temples and family history archives, as well as related activities and facilities all concerned directly with our mission. But it should be recognized that all of these are money-consuming assets and not money-producing assets. They are expensive to build and maintain. They do not produce financial wealth, but they do much to strengthen and build Latter-day Saints.

We have a few income-producing business properties, but the return from these would keep the Church going only for a very brief time. Tithing is the Lord's law of finance. There is no other financial law like it. It is a principle given with a promise, spoken by the Lord Himself for the blessing of His children.

I repeat what I have said before—when all is said and done, the only real wealth of the Church is in the faith of its people.

Question 11: *""Why is the Church in commercial enterprises?""*

Essentially, the business assets which the Church has today are an outgrowth of enterprises which were begun in the pioneer era of our history when we were isolated in the West. When there was no longer a need for a number of these, they were disposed of. The remaining number are relatively few.",3.0

""Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you.

""And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches … to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted."" (Jacob 2:17–19.)

How blessed we would be if we could pattern our conduct after the Nephites described by Alma:

""And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church.""

For instance, if you look in verse 11, ""It is wisdom in me (and) a commandment I give unto you that ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man his stewardship."" So even though we tend to think of consecration as everybody sharing everything and I can come in and borrow Tyler's tie or take Taylor's shoes, it never worked that way. Everybody agreed to consecrate what they had for the Lord but consecration or consecrate is just a term that means make holy. After it was consecrated, or basically recognized by the Lord, a stewardship was given back to the individual and that stewardship was their private property and the individual was allowed to basically work with what they had and do what they could with it for the benefit of themselves, their family and the larger Church.

Another principle, and this is found in verse 14, is to recognize that everything belongs to God. The Savior here says, ""I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine."" So a second principle of Church finance is to recognize that everything belongs to God, that what we're working with, whether it's our home, the money that we
make from our profession, whatever blessings we've been given, it really, ultimately, belongs to God and we need to think of it in that way, that it's not our personal property, it's God's property that he's loaning to us to help us to build up the kingdom of God.",0.0

The Church does have substantial assets, for which we are grateful. These assets are primarily in buildings in more than eighty nations. They are in ward and stake meeting facilities. They are in schools and seminaries, colleges and institutes. They are in welfare projects. They are in mission homes and missionary training centers. They are in temples, of which we have substantially more than we have ever had in the past, and they are in genealogical facilities. But it should be recognized that all of these are money-consuming assets and not money-producing assets. They are expensive to build and maintain. They do not produce financial wealth, but they do help to produce and strengthen Latter-day Saints. They are only a means to an end. They are physical facilities to accommodate the programs of the Church in our great responsibility to teach the gospel to the world, to build faith and activity among the living membership, and to carry forward the compelling mandate of the Lord concerning the redemption of the dead.

We have a few income-producing business properties, but the return from these would keep the Church going only for a very short time. Tithing is the Lord's law of finance.

The widow's or child's mite is as important and acceptable as the rich man's offerings. When men, women, and children are honest with God and pay their tithes and offerings, the Lord gives them wisdom whereby they can do as much or more with the remainder than they could if they had not been honest with the Lord. Many times they are blessed and prospered in various ways—spiritually, physically, and mentally, as well as materially. I bear my witness to you that this is true, and I am sure that many of you can bear such a testimony.

Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, ""It is more blessed to give than to receive."" (Acts 20:35.)

What are riches for, then? To be used in doing good. Therefore, let us dedicate our means to the building of the kingdom of God. Let us this day resolve to be honest with the Lord in the payment of our tithes and offerings.

I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, and this is far more important than earthly riches.

And I know that the gospel in its fullness has been restored in this dispensation through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and that there is a living prophet at the head of the Church today, President Joseph Fielding Smith. This is likewise of more value than any amount of earthly wealth.

However, a testimony alone will not save us. It is the keeping of the commandments of God—living the life of a true Latter-day Saint. It is important, then, to appreciate that the gospel has to be lived in order to be fully realized and its power received.

Therefore, let us dispense the means which the Lord has given us to enrich the lives of others who are less fortunate than we are and to build the kingdom of God, that we may make of our life a good gift to God, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.",0.0

But we are under covenant to live the law of consecration today and you've just gotten through describing some elements of how that works, that we put – anything that I own whether it be my vehicles, my home, any of my possessions, or any of my talents, any of the blessings, the spiritual gifts that God has given me, they become part of what you would call, quote unquote, the bishop's storehouse. If there's a need for a fireside or for a talk and a bishop can call upon you to share from your storehouse of knowledge and study and experience, to consecrate that to the needs, to the circumstances, to the things that are going on in your ward, or at a stake level. And when I go to the fast offering experience or to the humanitarian fund, or tithing, it all comes in. This is the Lord's money and he has given us stewardship over it but we consecrate it to the Lord so it becomes part of this larger consecrated effort to build up the kingdom of God in a variety of ways but the one that he keeps coming back to over and over again is caring for the poor and the needy, making sure that we're not focusing so much on the acquisition of wealth from my kingdom, my little world or my family, that we're turning our back on those who are in want.

I bring you greetings from the greatest group of missionaries in the world. It is a marvelous thing to labor among them and to feel the strength of the Lord as he works through them and the Saints to bring the gospel of Jesus Christ to his children.

The blessing of sharing the gospel message is overwhelming. I am often filled with the feelings I think Paul may have had when he wrote to the saints at Ephesus, regarding his call to serve the Lord:

""Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me …

""Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;

""According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus, our Lord:

""In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.

""For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."" (Eph. 3:7–8, 11–12, 14.)

This same feeling of humble gratitude seems to fill the hearts of every member and missionary who becomes involved in sharing the gospel. As we see the peace and assurance that come to those who receive the gospel, we become more conscious of the great obligation and opportunity we have to share the restored gospel of Jesus Christ with our friends and neighbors, our brothers and sisters.",0.0

God is a very wealthy personage. We all like to inherit from a wealthy parent and what could be more exciting than to inherit from God, to get everything that God has. Someone has said that thrift is a great virtue, especially in an ancestor. And God has been very thrifty, he has also been very wise and he has been very generous. To begin with, he created us in his own image and has endowed us with a set of his attributes and potentialities, the development of which is one of the purposes for which we live. He desires that every one of us should be rich. He has said: ""… the fulness of the earth is yours …"" (D&C 59:16), and it pleaseth God that he has given all these things unto men to be used with judgment and thanksgiving. He has shared with us the fulness of the treasures of the earth and he desires to share with us the fulness of the treasures of heaven. He wants us to inherit the celestial kingdom and belong to that celestial order of which he himself is a member.

That knowledge is obtained from the explicit and symbolic teachings of the endowment, and from the whisperings of the Spirit that come as we are desirous to seek and receptive to hear the revelation available to us in that sacred place.

As regards property, Jesus taught that ""a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth"" (Luke 12:15). Consequently, we should not lay up for ourselves ""treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal"" (Matt. 6:19). In other words, the treasures of our hearts—our priorities—should not be what the scriptures call ""riches [and] the vain things of this world"" (Alma 39:14). The ""vain things of [the] world"" include every combination of that worldly quartet of property, pride, prominence, and power. As to all of these, the scriptures remind us that ""you cannot carry them with you"" (Alma 39:14). We should be seeking the kind of treasures the scriptures promise the faithful: ""great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures"" (D&C 89:19).

All around us we have the good examples of those who seek permanent treasures—those who ""hunger and thirst after righteousness"" (Matt. 5:6) and put the kingdom of God first in their lives. Among the most visible such examples are the men and women who set aside their worldly pursuits and even say good-bye to their families to serve missions for the Lord. Tens of thousands of these are young missionaries. In addition, I pay particular tribute to those who serve missions in their mature years, some as mission leaders and some as what we call couple missionaries.

""No,"" I answered, ""you can still see my big toe.""

They were, Mormon says, ""poor as to things of the world; and also … poor in heart""13—two conditions that almost always go together. Missionary companions Alma and Amulek counter that reprehensible rejection of the shabbily dressed by telling them that whatever privileges others may deny them, they can always pray—in their fields and in their houses, in their families and in their hearts.14

But then, to this very group who had themselves been turned away, Amulek says, ""After [you] have [prayed], if *[you]* turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, *if [you] have [it],* to those who stand in need—I say unto *you,* … your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and [you] are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.""15 What a stunning reminder that rich *or* poor, we are to ""do what we can"" when others are in need.

Furthermore, I don't know exactly how each of you should fulfill your obligation to those who do not or cannot always help themselves.

Our burden of taxes would be lightened. The giver would not suffer but would be blessed by his small abstinence.

The deepest cause of conflict directly or indirectly affecting political relationships between Latter-day Saints and others was the belief in continuing revelation. Non-Mormons viewed the claim of continuing revelation and the social and political forms built on that claim as threats to democratic self-government. While the Book of Mormon was being printed, a mass meeting of Palmyra residents pledged to boycott it. The Prophet Joseph Smith was arrested several times on charges brought, according to his accusers, ""to open the eyes and understanding of those who blindly follow"" him. When the Church was hardly large enough to ""man a farm, or meet a woman with a milk-pail,"" recalled Sidney Rigdon, non-Mormons were already accusing them of wanting ""to upset the Government"" (*HC* 6:289).

The turmoil of the New York period was only a harbinger of intense conflicts to follow. As the practical implications of belief in new revelation and obedience to a new prophet became clear, anti-Mormon opposition intensified. For the Prophet and his followers, divine calling made possible-indeed, morally incumbent-the effort to create a just society, which the revelations called Zion. For non-Mormon neighbors, these efforts constituted challenges that they determined to resist.",3.0

Almost overnight, it grew from a village of religious refugees and new converts to the point where it rivaled Chicago as the largest city in Illinois. With Democrats and Whigs both vying for the Mormon vote, Nauvoo was granted one of the most liberal city charters in the state, an independent military force, and a strong judicial system (see Nauvoo Charter). However, as in Missouri during the 1830s, natural rivalry with older citizens in neighboring towns like Carthage (the county seat) and Warsaw (the next largest port city) turned to jealousy and hatred as Nauvoo's economic and political power grew (see Nauvoo Economy; Nauvoo Politics).

These tensions coalesced around Joseph Smith. In addition to being prophet and President of the Church, he also served as mayor, commander of the Nauvoo Legion state militia, justice of the peace, and university chancellor. Non-Mormon fears of this concentration of powers were intensified by the Church's belief in the theocratic union of spiritual, economic, and political matters under the priesthood. This and other ""unorthodox"" doctrines, such as continuing revelation, temple ordinances for the living and the dead, new scripture, and plural marriage, further intensified political and economic rivalries.

Illinois anti-Mormons, perhaps assisted by old enemies from Missouri, joined with a handful of determined Mormon defectors within Nauvoo. Several had held high Church positions and, when excommunicated, fueled efforts to destroy Joseph Smith and the Church.",3.0

The effort brought social, economic, and political innovations, including the gathering of the Saints, consecration and stewardship, the United Order, and plural marriage. In all matters relevant to building Zion, the LDS community looked to the Prophet for guidance, concentrating power, even against his own inclinations, in his hands.

Efforts to establish Zion excited fear and animosity. Made uneasy by ever-increasing numbers of Latter-day Saints and shocked or bemused by their economic and social experiments, many non-Mormons viewed the Saints as alien and hostile, even as a threat to their freedoms as Americans.

Because of the loss of property in earlier persecutions, he was unable to pay his debts and had to fend off creditors. When Illinois political leaders turned against the Latter-day Saints and no national leaders would champion their cause, the Prophet declared his candidacy for president of the United States, gaining a platform from which to discuss the rights of his people (*see* Nauvoo Politics*).*

By April 1844, dissenters openly challenged Joseph Smith's leadership by organizing a reform church and publishing a newspaper, the Nauvoo Expositor, for the purpose of denouncing him. Perceiving the *Expositor* as a threat to the peace of the community, the Nauvoo city council, with Joseph Smith presiding as mayor, authorized him to order the destruction of the press-an act that ignited the opposition. On June 12 the Prophet was charged with riot for destruction of the press. After a flurry of legal maneuvers, Joseph submitted to arrest at nearby Carthage, the county seat, under the governor's pledge of protection. Joseph had premonitions of danger, and the vocal threats of hotheads in adjoining towns gave substance to his fears.

Beginning soon after his ministry began and continuing throughout his life, Joseph Smith was subjected to approximately thirty criminal actions and at least that many civil suits related to debt collection or failed financial ventures.

The first charge of being a ""disorderly person"" involved treasure hunting for hire, brought against him at South Bainbridge, New York, in 1826 by a disgruntled Methodist preacher related to Josiah Stowell, Joseph's employer. When Stowell refused to testify against him at the trial, Joseph was discharged. In July 1830 in the same venue, Joseph was tried and acquitted by another magistrate on charges of ""being a disorderly person, of setting the county in an uproar by preaching the Book of Mormon, etc."" (*HC* 1:88). The trial ended at midnight.

Hyrum was vice mayor and running for office in the state legislature. Politically, they were ""two of the most influential men in Illinois"" at the time.15 As such, their assassinations are not only important to Latter-day Saint history, but also the history of the state of Illinois.

The men who colluded together to kill Joseph and Hyrum had a diverse and complex set of motives for their actions—thus understanding *why* these two influential leaders were murdered is complex and involves numerous different factors. As Bentley explains:

> Many factors contributed to the Prophet's murder on June 27, 1844. Among these were fear of the Nauvoo Legion's power; perceived abuses related to powers granted under the Nauvoo Charter; political unrest caused by the rapidly increasing Mormon population in Hancock County, Illinois, and Lee County, Iowa; economic competition with some of the leading Mormon opponents; persisting grudges among some Missourians; rumors distorting the beginnings of the limited practice of plural marriage; criticism of Joseph Smith's presidential campaign; and the concentration of legislative, judicial, executive, military, and religious power in one man, Joseph Smith.16

Once they were detained, anti-Mormon mobs whipped up into a frenzy by the charged rhetoric published by Sharp and others would seize the opportunity to execute the Prophet and his brother in an act of what they perceived as ""vigilante justice.""

This plan was put into action as early as February 26, 1844, when the Law brothers and their collaborators instituted or appealed a series of lawsuits to Carthage. Already at this point, Joseph suspected a darker plot at work than merely resolving legal differences.4 After those lawsuits were consolidated and dismissed, the dissenters initiated additional legal suits in May. Eventually, some of these were successful in getting Joseph out of Nauvoo, and thus he was in Carthage on May 27, 1844, exactly one month before his martyrdom. On that occasion, Charles Foster—one of the conspirators—evidently had a temporary change of heart and notified Joseph of a plan to have him assassinated the next day.

This was not a spontaneous or unexpected event—Joseph himself anticipated that he went ""as a lamb to the slaughter"" (Doctrine and Covenants 135:4) and had in fact feared for his life for at least several months, perhaps longer. And he had good reason to fear—there was, in fact, a murderous plot to have him and his brother kidnapped and killed.

Bentley, the key Nauvoo apostates were a trio of brothers, William and Wilson Law, Robert and Charles Foster, and Francis and Chauncey Higbee.

In reaction to this threat, Joseph declared martial law in Nauvoo, calling out the Nauvoo Legion to protect the city from invasion. The threatened invasion never came, and after Governor Ford met with Joseph's enemies in Warsaw and Carthage, he insisted that Joseph come to Carthage to stand trial yet again for the riot charge. The Governor guaranteed Joseph that he would be protected. However, he insisted on disarming the Nauvoo Legion in order to keep the peace, but did not disarm the other militias at the same time.

Once in Carthage, Joseph and other defendants were arraigned on the riot charge and posted bail when the Higbees deliberately failed to present witnesses and asked for their case to be rescheduled for September. Before Joseph and Hyrum could leave Carthage, however, they were charged with treason for having declared martial law—yet another legal charge that lacked any legal merit, but was useful because treason was a non-bailable offense. This prevented Joseph and Hyrum from leaving, and left them trapped in Carthage Jail, vulnerable to mob action.

Inside the jail, Hyrum read from the book of Ether in the Book of Mormon and Joseph bore a strong testimony to the guards of the truthfulness of the Restoration, of the Book of Mormon, and of the visitations of angels. Outside, the mob, eventually numbering about 2,000, was able to mobilize, with people standing ready to join from Missouri, and then come to Carthage and assassinate Joseph and Hyrum late in the afternoon of June 27, 1844.12",1.0

Many centuries earlier, Moroni had stressed this same point, indicating that the record was a work prepared and consecrated to God for ""the welfare and blessing of the ancient and long dispersed covenant people of the Lord"" (Mormon 8:15). In short, the Book of Mormon was a sacred book. This element of sacredness is a feature shared by other records on metal plates from the ancient world.",3.0

At the end of four years he was given the plates, which contained a record of God's dealings with the ancient people on the American continent and contained the gospel in its fullness. He translated the engravings on these plates by the gift and power of God and by revelation, and to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.

We have this promise given by Moroni regarding the Book of Mormon:

""And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

""And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things."" (Moro. 10:4–5.)

I humbly bear testimony that the truthfulness of these things has been revealed to me and that the gospel has been restored in these the latter days through his prophet, Joseph Smith, to whom God the Father and his Son appeared; that God lives; that Jesus is the Christ, who came and gave his life for you and me that we might enjoy immortality and eternal life.",3.0

In September of 1823, he was again visited by a heavenly messenger who told him his name was Moroni and that God had a work for Joseph to do.

The angel told him of a book, written upon gold plates, that was deposited in a nearby hill. The plates contained an account of the former inhabitants of the American continent, and also the fulness of the everlasting gospel as delivered by the Savior to those ancient people. Joseph was instructed to visit the spot where the plates were deposited each year for four years. This he did, and on each occasion he was met and instructed by the angel Moroni until finally he was ready to receive and translate the plates.

If any of you are not already familiar with the story of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, I invite you to avail yourselves of the opportunity to do so. Read the book itself, which contains this promise in the last chapter:

""And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

""And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things"" (Moro. 10:4–5).

It is this power which bears witness to hundreds of thousands of converts each year that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that the Book of Mormon is true, that it is a companion book to the Bible and a new and further witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ and a record of his dealings with the early inhabitants of America.",3.0

For everyone else, they were often present in the room but veiled by a cloth. This suggests that the plates functioned as a symbol of Jesus Christ, a constant reminder that he was an integral part of the translation process.

Similar imagery can be found in the ancient Israelite tabernacle and temple. Only the high priest on the Day of Atonement was allowed to go beyond the veil and enter into the Holy of Holies—the Lord's symbolic dwelling place (see Leviticus 16:2). For everyone else, the holy of holies, like the plates of the Book of Mormon, was outwardly visible but inwardly inaccessible.34 The sacred space was strictly forbidden, and those who ventured there or engaged in unauthorized activities did so at their own peril.35

Interestingly, the Nephite artifacts—those which Joseph Smith found in a stone box and which were shown to the Three Witnesses—all have parallels to the relics contained in the Israelite Ark of the Covenant, which was located in the Holy of Holies.36 In particular, the Ark stored the Ten Commandments which contained God's commandments inscribed into stone, much like the Book of Mormon contains Christ's words engraved into metal.

Thus, the veiled presence of the plates during the translation may symbolize their status as a holy artifact, comparable to the sacred tablets which contained the word of God in the Old Testament.37 Recognizing these relationships, and also noticing that the timing of Joseph Smith's discovery and retrieval of the plates coincided with relevant ancient Jewish festivals,38 Don Bradley has viewed Joseph as fulfilling a ""role like that of the biblical high priest.""39",3.0

After four years of waiting, learning, and personal refinement, 21-year-old Joseph Smith was finally entrusted by the angel Moroni with the ancient record that for centuries had lain in waiting in a stone box embedded in a hill near his home. Recalling this time years later, Joseph said that almost as soon as he had received the plates ""the most strenuous exertions were used to get them from me. Every stratagem that could be invented was resorted to for that purpose. The persecution became more bitter and severe than before, and multitudes were on the alert continually to get them from me if possible."" In today's episode we take a closer look at what we know of these efforts to get the plates from Joseph and the surprising supernatural means his antagonists resorted to in their attempts to do so. We also dive into Joseph's initial creative efforts in 1828 to get the record translated, including creating an Egyptian alphabet from the engravings on the plates, as well as sending Martin Harris to New York to recruit linguistic experts to help in translating the book. And although these secular translation efforts ultimately failed, the lessons learned through this experience continue to offer value to us today.

As for the plates themselves, Emma Smith reported that they ""often lay on the table without any attempt at concealment, wrapped in a small linen table cloth.""4 Other witnesses recalled that on a few occasions the plates were kept ""in a nearby box under the bed or even hidden in the Whitmer's barn during translation.""5

These accounts have caused some to wonder why the plates were necessary at all. In other words, why did Joseph Smith have to go through all the trouble to retrieve them, protect them, and keep them nearby during the translation process, if they simply sat there idle and unused?

There is no mistaking this for an instruction to show the plates to the three witnesses. It also indicates that they should see it by the power of God. Based on the difference between the testimonies of the three and the eight witnesses, the power of God provided a spiritual context in which they saw the plates. The eight, not mentioned here, would see them in a more mundane context.

Even though the eight witnesses are not specifically mentioned, it is declared that ""in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth him good will he establish his word."" The eight will be among them. Also among them is Mary Whitmer, who told the story of having been shown the plates by an older gentleman who showed them to her to ease her mind from the burden of hosting those who were translating.

1. Evidence suggests that on some occasions during early stages of the translation, Joseph directly utilized the plates in the dictation process.

2. As a physical object which Joseph Smith had personally seen and knew that he could obtain if he was faithful, the plates no doubt helped motivate him to be worthy of his impending prophetic calling.

3. The plates serve, even today, as an object lesson about prioritizing sacred things over worldly temptations.

4. Characters copied from the plates helped convince Martin Harris of their authenticity.

5. The copied characters also facilitated the fulfillment of a significant Book of Mormon prophecy.

6. The physical presence of the plates helped strengthen the faith of Joseph and his associates that his translation was tied to a genuine ancient artifact created by real ancient prophets.

7. The presence of the plates all but eliminates the possibility that Joseph Smith was merely *mistaken* about his revelatory claims, thereby impelling a choice between truth or fraud, while also leaving no rational grounds for interpreting the Book of Mormon as ""inspired fiction.""

He never produced a ""Book of Kinderhook.""20, 490: ""After the first meeting, no further mention was made of translation, and the Kinderhook plates dropped out of sight. Joseph may not have detected the fraud, but he did not swing into a full-fledged translation as he had with the Egyptian scrolls.

Instead of exposing the plot immediately, as they had probably intended to do, they said nothing until 1879, when one of them signed an affidavit describing the fabrication."""") Whatever Joseph Smith may have thought of the Kinderhook plates, the Lord could not be fooled. God would not and did not reveal a translation of these bogus artifacts.

The more universal message from the Kinderhook incident is that Joseph's ability to translate, like the case of Mosiah's in the Book of Mormon, was a gift from God, and only worked when God enabled him to do His will. The gift of ""the interpretation of languages,"" like all spiritual gifts, ""come[s] by the Spirit of Christ; and they come unto every man severally, according as [Christ] will"" (Moroni 10:16). Like Joseph and Mosiah, we all have gifts from the Lord, which can only be properly used to build-up the kingdom of God. If we try to use these gifts from the Lord for inappropriate or irrelevant purposes, we can expect underwhelming results, like those from the case of the Kinderhook plates.",1.0

Another important consideration is that the presence of the plates helped confirm Joseph Smith's revelatory claims.10: xxiv argues that the presence of the plates makes it difficult to ""contend that there were no Nephites but that Joseph Smith was nonetheless an inspired prophet.

Included in the record were prophecies of Isaiah (1 Ne. 19:22-23; cf. 5:13). All of the Isaiah texts in the Book of Mormon are quotations from that record, except perhaps those cited by the risen Jesus (cf. 1 Ne. 16, 21- 22). Whether quoting directly or paraphrasing, Book of Mormon prophets were trying to do two things: ""persuade [people] to believe in the Lord their Redeemer"" (1 Ne. 19:23) and reveal the plans of God for his people, as noted by the prophet Isaiah (e.g., 2 Ne. 25:7; Hel. 8:18-20; 3 Ne. 23:1-2). These features give a singular quality to the Isaiah texts of the Book of Mormon, because it preserves almost exclusively the texts pertaining to salvation and saving principles and ignores Isaiah's historical material. The concerns of Book of Mormon prophets were doctrinal, and passages were utilized to expound their testimonies. Moreover, the passages that concern salvation from the later chapters of Isaiah are presented to show that Jesus was the promised Messiah (cf. Mosiah 13:33-15:31, which cites Isa. 53;52:7, 8-10). While nineteenth-century biblical scholarship held that the concept of a ""saving Messiah"" arose after the Babylonian exile (587-538 B.C.) and therefore the later chapters of Isaiah are to be dated to the end of the sixth century or later, the Book of Mormon texts obviously undermine that theory.",2.0

It is evident that the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts provide evidence contravening modern theories of multiple authorship of Isaiah's book (see Isaiah: Authorship); for if the origins of the Isaiah material in the Book of Mormon are accepted as stated by its authors, then by 600 B.C. the book of Isaiah was essentially as it is today. The chief value of textual criticism, in this case, is to help identify special themes and language patterns, that is, to provide a better understanding of the message, not a determination of authorship. The most viable and certainly the most productive option for determining the origin of the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts is therefore an internal examination.",2.0

The attraction derives primarily from the extensive use of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon. Secondarily, chapter 11 of Isaiah was quoted to Joseph Smith in a vision in his earliest days as a prophet (JS-H 1:40) and became the subject of a section in the Doctrine and Covenants (D&C 113). In addition, Jesus Christ has given revelations about, and prophets and apostles of the latter days have frequently quoted from and commented upon Isaiah's words when instructing the Saints.

Traditionally, the book of Isaiah has been ascribed to a prophet living in the kingdom of Judah between 740 and 690 B.C. In Germany during the late 1700s, several scholars challenged this view, claiming that chapters 40-66 were written by one or more other individuals as late as 400 B.C. because of the specific references to events that occurred after Isaiah's death. This outlook now permeates many Bible commentaries and has led to the postulation of a second prophetic writer who is commonly called in scholarly literature ""Deutero-Isaiah."" Indeed, a wide variety of theories regarding the date and authorship of Isaiah now exist. However, LDS belief in revelation and the seership of prophets, along with the quotations from Isaiah in the Book of Mormon and its admonitions to study his writings, have reinforced Latter-day Saints in the traditional view concerning the date and authorship of Isaiah, in the following ways.

First, while some scholars argue that prophets could not see the future and that, therefore, the later chapters of Isaiah must have been written after Isaiah's time (e.g., Isa. 45 concerning Cyrus), Latter-day Saints recognize that prophets can see and prophesy about the future. In chapters 40-66, Isaiah prophesies of the future, just as the apostle John does in Revelation 4-22,and the prophet Nephi 1 in 2 Nephi 25-30.",2.0

When the Book of Mormon people left Jerusalem, they carried records on plates of brass that contained many Old Testament books predating 600 B.C., including Isaiah. Early in their narratives, Nephi 1 and his brother, Jacob, quoted extensively from Isaiah. Later, the resurrected Jesus admonished his hearers in the Americas to search the words of Isaiah diligently, for ""great are the words of Isaiah"" (3 Ne. 23:1).

Latter-day Saints see many of Isaiah's prophecies fulfilled in contemporary events. When the angel Moroni appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith on September 21-22, 1823, he quoted Isaiah 11 and said it was ""about to be fulfilled"" (JS-H 1:40). Isaiah 29 is also seen as a prophecy anticipating the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith's teachings contain many references to Isaiah, especially about the last days before the second coming of Christ. Additionally, Isaiah is often quoted in the Doctrine and Covenants (e.g., 45:10; 50:10-12; 64:34-35; 133), and in some cases interpretations are added (e.g., D&C 113).",3.0

The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants, modern LDS scriptures, confirm this assessment and contain extensive commentaries on his writings. The Book of Mormon quotes 425 verses and paraphrases many others from the book of Isaiah, taken from the plates of brass, a record brought to the Western Hemisphere by the prophet Lehi and his family (c. 600 B.C.). The Book of Mormon quotations from Isaiah are accompanied by the interpretations of Nephite prophets and the resurrected Jesus Christ. The Doctrine and Covenants likewise contains quotations and paraphrases of Isaiah, many illuminating the setting for and relevance of the fulfillment of his prophecies.

**THE BOOK OF MORMON.** The prophets in the Book of Mormon explicitly praise the writings of Isaiah and provide a thorough commentary thereon. Besides three early nephite prophets, Nephi 1, Jacob, and Abinadi, who quoted extensively from and explained the meanings of Isaiah, the resurrected Jesus Christ, when he visited the Nephites (A.D. 34), commanded his hearers to ""search these things diligently; for great are the words of Isaiah"" (3 Ne. 23:1). Most Book of Mormon citations of Isaiah concern two themes: (1) the testimony that Jesus Christ would come into the world to save it (1 Ne. 19:23; cf. 2 Ne. 9:5-12), and (2) pronouncements that even though the Lord would scatter Israel, he would gather and restore them, fulfilling the covenants that he made with Abraham and Israel (2 Ne. 6:5; cf. 9:1-2).",3.0

Book of Mormon prophets taught from the brass plate records, not only from chapters 1-39, which are usually assigned by scholars to the prophet Isaiah of the eighth century B.C., but also from the later chapters, the so-called Deutero-Isaiah. For example, Isaiah chapters 48-54 are all quoted in the Book of Mormon, with some passages mentioned a number of times (1 Ne. 20-21; 2 Ne. 6:16-8:25; Mosiah 12:21-24;14;15:29-31; 3 Ne. 16:18-20;20:32-45;22).

Nephi, his brother Jacob, and Isaiah had each seen the Redeemer (as the premortal Jesus Christ) face to face (2 Ne. 11:2-3; cf. 2 Ne. 16:1-7). Nephi's own vision (1 Ne. 11:13-20) clarified Isaiah's words pointing to the coming of Christ (cf. 2 Ne. 17:14;19:6-7i.e., [Isa. 7:14;9:6-7]).

Nephi's commentary on Isaiah 2-14 describes what was to happen to the Jews (2 Ne. 25:9-21; cf. Isa. 3:1-15;5:1-7), to Nephi's own people (2 Ne. 25:22-26:11; cf. Isa. 29:1-4), and among the Gentiles (2 Ne. 26:12-28:32; cf. Isa. 3:16-4:1). Nephi knew by revelation that when the Book of Mormon would come forth among Gentiles, churches would be lifted up in pride and learning, secret combinations would prevail, and priestcraft would flourish (2 Ne. 26:14-33; cf. Isa. 3:16-4:1; 2 Ne. 13:16-14:1). By contrast, he foresaw that beautiful branches of Israel would be cleansed and grow in both Zion and Jerusalem and that they would be protected by the Lord (Isa. 4:2-6; 2 Ne. 14:2-6). Expanding Isaiah's prophecy, Nephi prophesied that Gentiles who repented would be numbered with the house of Israel and become heirs of the promised blessings (2 Ne. 30:1-3). He affirmed that his own people would again receive the gospel of Jesus Christ and become a pure and delightsome people (2 Ne. 30:4-6). He foretold the gathering of Jews to Jerusalem, as they would begin to believe in Christ, and also as a delightsome people (2 Ne. 30:7).",2.0

Initially, some Church leaders encourage first-time readers to move through these chapters, understanding what is accessible and saving the rest for later study. In Isaiah's writings, Latter-day Saints find an important testimony of Christ and of the fulfillment of God's covenants with the house of Israel. Christ admonished his followers to ""search these things diligently, for great are the words of Isaiah"" (3 Ne. 23:11).

Another possible hurdle for readers is the book's nonchronological insertions. Nephi and Jacob and Jacob's descendants wrote first-person accounts from about 590 B.C. until about 150 B.C., and then Mormon (about A.D. 385) inserted a shorter chapter to explain his role as abridger of another record. Then the reader is returned via Mormon's abridgment to the history of Nephi's successors and of the descendants of Alma 1. As groups of people break away from and return to the main body, parts of their records are incorporated into the book, causing the reader to jump back to earlier events. Likewise, Moroni's abridgment of the very ancient book of Ether appears out of chronological order near the end. In addition, the Book of Mormon, like the Old Testament, describes events from widely separated intervals. As an abridgment, it contains only a small part of the proceedings of these ancient peoples.",3.0

He declared that when the words of Isaiah were fulfilled, the covenants made to the house of Israel would be fulfilled (3 Ne. 20:11-12). The gospel will be taught to Jews in their scattered locations and, after they accept it, they will return to Jerusalem and teach their own people (3 Ne. 20:29-35; cf. Isa. 52:8-10). Jesus gave his hearers a sign that the restoration of Jews to Jerusalem would indicate that the restoration had already begun among other Israelites in Zion, the Americas (3 Ne. 21:1-7; Isa. 52:1-3, 6-7, 11-12). In a reference to the ""marred"" servant of Isaiah 52:13-15,he spoke of the servant's ""marvelous work."" While the marred servant was clearly the mortal Jesus (Mosiah 15:1-9), Isaiah's words form a dual prophecy because the resurrected Jesus said that it also referred to a latter-day servant. Latter-day Saints believe that this servant was the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the marvelous work referred to was the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the restoration of the gospel (3 Ne. 21:8-11).

While expanding on Isaiah's words, Jesus foretold the building of the New Jerusalem in the Western Hemisphere by a remnant of the house of Israel, assisted by converted Gentiles (3 Ne. 21:22-25; cf. 20:22). The gospel is to be preached among the various groups of the house of Israel, including the Lamanites and the lost tribes (3 Ne. 21:26).",3.0

The numerous relationships between the two books also show us how the Nephites incorporated some of the timeless truths of Deuteronomy into their lives, teaching us how we can do the same.

For example, Deuteronomy tells us that good leaders should care more about knowing and keeping the commandments than they do about money or possessions (see Deuteronomy 17:14–20). King Benjamin clearly took this counsel to heart (see Mosiah 2:10–13). His life is an example of how we can apply Deuteronomy to ourselves and become better leaders. Another example is in Deuteronomy 31:9–13, which tells people that they should make the scriptures a focal point of their lives. Alma 5 gives practical ways in which people can make this ideal a reality in daily life.

Another doctrine, found in Deuteronomy 6:7–9, states that parents should teach the commandments ""diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up."" Alma 36–42 is an example of how Alma obeyed this commandment and shows us how we can fulfill this commandment today as well.

When we understand how the Nephites lived the commandments contained in Deuteronomy and applied its teachings to their own lives, we can have a better idea of how we can apply Deuteronomy to ourselves as well, allowing it to become an important source of insight into how we can live better lives today.",3.0

They are the only extant Isaiah texts that have no ""original"" language source with which the translation can be textually compared. These English texts date to the translation and initial publication of the Book of Mormon (1829).

These Isaiah texts were quoted and paraphrased by many Book of Mormon prophets who had a copy of Isaiah on the plates of brass. Attempts to determine the authenticity of those Book of Mormon Isaiah texts by comparing them with Hebrew, Greek, and Latin texts of Isaiah hold interest, but such efforts are moot because the ancient texts behind the Book of Mormon Isaiah translation are not available for study. However, much can be learned by comparing the numerous ancient versions and translations of Isaiah with the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts. Such comparisons result in granting the Book of Mormon Isaiah full recensional status.

The Isaiah materials in the Book of Mormon exhibit many similarities to those in the King James translation of the Bible, which would seem to indicate that both share a Hebrew Masoretic origin. However, many other peculiarities in the Book of Mormon texts point to an origin related to texts similar to those from which the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate were derived. These peculiar readings are significant enough that they preclude relegating the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts to being a mere copy of the King James Version. The Isaiah texts found in English translation in the Book of Mormon possess a distinctive character that indicates a unique textual origin. The important question is not, ""Are the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts authentic?"" Rather, the issue is, ""Do the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts provide clear evidence of variant texts besides those normally acknowledged?""

But ""when the king had heard the words of the book of the law … he rent his clothes"" in grief, knowing that he and his people had not kept the laws in this book (vv. 11–13).

—because it's been so thoroughly disproved. But here's just, in a nutshell, some of the problems. The Manuscript Found, Solomon Spalding's work, is 50,840 words. That means it is less than a fifth of the actual length of the Book of Mormon. You've still got to come up with four-fifths of the Book of Mormon, even if you're saying he plagiarized from this. The writing style and the composition of the two books are really, really different. For instance, the Book of Mormon follows this kind of King James language. The Spaulding manuscript does not. The Spalding manuscript and the Book of Mormon don't have similarities in their storyline. The Spalding manuscript is about a Roman galleon that gets blown off course and lands in the Americas. The Book of Mormon is totally, totally different from that. And honestly, most people, when they have the chance to look at the Spaulding Manuscript and look at the Book of Mormon back off. For instance, Gerald and Sandra Tanner, who have been, like, the top opponents of the Book of Mormon for a long time and written a lot of critical stuff about Joseph Smith, said, ""We do have the original Spaulding manuscript and the Book of Mormon, which do not appear to have enough in common to insist that the latter came from the former.""",2.0

Such theories, however, soon were found to be counter to documentary evidence and inconsistent with historical events. As several knowledgeable witnesses attested, Rigdon first saw the Book of Mormon in November 1830, well after it had already been published, and he first met Joseph Smith in person in December 1830—too late to have collaborated on the composition of the Book of Mormon.16: 111–123. Rigdon's authorship is often connected to the so-called ""Spaulding theory,"" hypothesizing that a manuscript written by Solomon Spaulding was used as the basis for the Book of Mormon, with additions/edits from Rigdon or another author.

As Rigdon learned of the accusation that he wrote the Book of Mormon, he immediately sought to set the record straight. On one occasion, in front a large gathering of people, he declared:

> I testify in the presence of this congregation, and before God and all his Holy Angels up yonder, (pointing toward heaven), before whom I expect to give account at the judgment day, that I never saw a sentence of the Book of Mormon, I never penned a sentence of the Book of Mormon, I never knew that there was such a book in existence as the Book of Mormon, until it was presented to me by Parley P.

Would you like to have emblazoned on your soul an undeniable witness that the Savior descended beneath your sins and that there is no sin, no mortal plight outside the merciful reach of His Atonement—that for each of your struggles He has a remedy of superior healing power? Then read the Book of Mormon. It will teach you and testify to you that Christ's Atonement is infinite because it circumscribes and encompasses and transcends every finite frailty known to man. That is why the prophet Mormon declared, ""Ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ"" (Moroni 7:41).

No wonder the Book of Mormon proclaims with boldness, ""And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ"" (2 Nephi 33:10). Together with the Bible, the Book of Mormon is an indispensable witness of the doctrines of Christ and His divinity. Together with the Bible, it ""teach[es] all men that they should do good"" (2 Nephi 33:10). And together with the Bible, it brings us to ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism.""

This biography of Joseph Smith, hostile to his prophetic claims, dismissed the idea of any connection between Spaulding and Smith or their writings. Rigdon first met Joseph Smith in December 1830 after the Book of Mormon was published.

Nevertheless, some have continued to promote the Spaulding theory (e.g., see Holley). In 1977, graphologists claimed to have detected similarities between the handwriting of Spaulding and of one of the scribes who transcribed some of the Book of Mormon from Joseph Smith's dictation. After considerable media attention and further scrutiny, anti-Mormon spokespersons acknowledged that they had been too hasty. The handwriting evidence did not support a connection between Solomon Spaulding and Joseph Smith.

One of them kept a record of their experiences among eastern and midwestern American Indian tribes. The 175-page manuscript was first published as a 115-page monograph in 1885, some seventy years after the death of its author, Solomon Spaulding (sometimes spelled Spalding). The only known manuscript was lost from 1839 until its discovery in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1884. It was promptly published by both the Latter-day Saints and Reorganized Latter Day Saint churches to refute the theory of some critics that it had served as an original source document for the Book of Mormon, supposedly supplied to Joseph Smith by Sidney Rigdon.

Spaulding was born in Ashford, Connecticut, on February 21, 1761. He served in the American Revolution, later graduated from Dartmouth College, and became a clergyman. He subsequently lost his faith in the Bible, left the ministry, and worked unsuccessfully at a variety of occupations in New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania until his death near Pittsburgh in 1816. About 1812 he wrote *Manuscript Found*, which he attempted to publish to relieve pressing debts.",0.0

Those who reject Joseph Smith's claim that he translated the book through divine power assume that he or one of his contemporaries wrote the book. Various claims or arguments have been advanced to support or discount these competing positions.

Disputes about the book's authorship arose as soon as its existence became public knowledge. The first general reaction was ridicule. Modern minds do not easily accept the idea that an angel can deliver ancient records to be translated by an untrained young man. Moreover, most Christians in 1830 viewed the canon of scripture as complete with the Bible; hence, the possibility of additional scripture violated a basic assumption of their faith. Opponents of Joseph Smith, such as Alexander Campbell, also argued that the Book of Mormon was heavily plagiarized from the Bible and that it reflected themes and phraseology current in New York in the 1820s. Many critics have speculated that Sidney Rigdon or Solomon Spaulding played a role in writing the book (see Spaulding Manuscript). It has also been suggested that Joseph Smith borrowed ideas from another book (see View of the Hebrews). Though these varieties of objections and theories are still defended in many quarters, they are not supported by modern authorship studies and continue to raise as many questions as they try to answer (e.g., *CWHN* 8:54-206).",3.0

For any not familiar with the Spaulding Theory, I turn again to my father's Leap of Faith book, with words again taken from his digital manuscript:

Sometime prior to 1829, a former Presbyterian Minister named Solomon Spaulding was known to have written a novel called ""The Manuscript Found,"" in which a fictional Indian describes events that took place in America before Columbus.
Joseph's detractors focused on the similarity between this plot line and the story of The Book of Mormon and insisted that Joseph was a simple plagiarist. Somehow, they say, he had come across the Spaulding book and pilfered it for his own purposes.",3.0

Those holding to this view see the book as reflecting no inspiration and having no historical value, although they may see some religious value in it as a statement of Joseph Smith's religious feelings. The assumption underlying this view may be either a doctrinaire rejection of divine intervention in human affairs or a specific rejection of Joseph Smith's claims to experience with the divine. Those maintaining this position may accept either the Spaulding theory or, more commonly, various environmentalist explanations for the contents of the book (see View of the Hebrews). One environmentalist explanation that has attracted some interest in the recent past among both believers and nonbelievers is based on the purported ""magic worldview"" that suffused the environment in which Joseph Smith grew up. However, this position has been heavily criticized and has not been widely received.

Another view of the Book of Mormon accepts its inspiration but rejects its historical authenticity, seeing it as in some sense inspired but not the product of antiquity, coming rather from the pen of Joseph Smith.

A third position accepts parts of the Book of Mormon as ancient, but views other parts of the book as inspired expansions on the text. This view has suffered because a concession that any part of the book is authentically ancient (and beyond the powers of Joseph Smith to have established through research) seems an admission that the Book of Mormon is what it claims to be and what has traditionally been claimed for it: that it is ancient.",1.0

Number four is that Joseph Smith went into some kind of trance state and wrote in what we call automatic writing, and then interestingly, a lot of opponents of the Book of Mormon have circled back to saying, ""Well, Joseph Smith was a genius. That's the only way to explain the Book of Mormon."" So the arc is that they start out saying, ""Joseph Smith was too dumb to have done this. What's an alternate explanation?"" to where we get to the point to where most modern opponents of the Book of Mormon are saying, ""Joseph Smith must have just been a genius. How else could he have done this?"" So let's walk through each one, OK? Starting with the one that gets the most currency, which is the Spaulding theory. So this is by far the most popular theory that shows up in the 19th century. Apparently there's a reverend named Solomon Spaulding who writes some kind of book about an early American civilization that's linked to the Book of Mormon. And the reason why this one worked so well and gained so much press was because the manuscript was lost. Nobody knew where it was, and so you could basically project anything you wanted to onto the manuscript and say, ""Yeah, Joseph Smith just stole from this."" Now, the theory was dealt a major blow when the manuscript was found. In 1884, it was found in Honolulu, Hawaii, of all places, and actually, that is the name of the manuscript when it was discovered. It's called Manuscript Found.

Because the power of the Holy Ghost will unequivocally testify to the historical reality and spiritual message of the Book of Mormon, it therefore stands as a valid witness of God's influence and interaction with His children.13 To believe in the truth of its stories is to believe in the divinity, resurrection, and miraculous power of Jesus Christ.

This new theory posits that ""Joseph [Smith] most likely grew up reading a school book called *The Late War* by Gilbert J. Hunt and it heavily influenced his writing of The Book of Mormon.""23 Published in 1816, The Late War Between the United States and Great Britain gave an account of the War of 1812 that was intended to be an educational textbook for schoolchildren. To support the idea that Joseph Smith drew from this book in fabricating the Book of Mormon, some authors have pointed to ""similarities"" and parallels between the two books, including ""over 100 rare phrases that bind The Book of Mormon to The Late War.""24

While this theory has become popular in some online circles, it suffers from many problems. Most glaring is the fact that, as demonstrated by recent statistical analysis, the ""similarities"" and linguistic parallels between the Book of Mormon and *The Late War* are easily explainable as shared imitation of the language of the King James Bible, and not direct literary dependence.25 Beyond this, others have pointed out that many of the parallels typically listed between the two books are illusory or otherwise rather weak.26",2.0

In this way we get a lot of biblical sounding text. The Book of Mormon, on the other hand, doesn't just use biblical language, it engages biblical issues – it asks questions about morality, about agency, about creation. It ponders the meaning of writing and reading. It describes religious experience.""27: 354–355."")

These problems with the Late War Theory indicate that in all likelihood, rather than the Book of Mormon flagrantly plagiarizing Hunt's work, the two books emerged alongside others in a shared early American literary culture.28, 2. Shalev also discussed the position of the Book of Mormon in this broader literary culture and wondered if ""the Book of Mormon's biblical language . . . catered to audiences' need to hear prophecy in the language that was universally accepted as suitable and even necessary for divine pronouncements."" Shalev, American Zion, 84–117, quote at 114. For another view, see Stanford Carmack, ""Is the Book of Mormon a Pseudo-Archaic Text?""

The weight is how common it is. The higher the weight, the rarer it is. So, the weight was already pretty low due to how common those statements were in other similar publications. When they were removed from the equation, the weight barely changed, but the number of parallels the Johnsons claimed between the two books was ""dramatically reduced.""

Is the phrase unique to the Book of Mormon and the Late War? Well, no.

Now, one that's popped up recently and gained some traction is a book called The Late War, which The Late War was a history of the War of 1812 written by a man named Gilbert Hunt that may have been in circulation in Joseph Smith's day. By the way, the full name is The Late War between the United States and Great Britain is the full name.

How was the Church involved in the Mountain Meadows Massacre?,33e0ee128e8a5383979668dbd885474d0a9471c96862e6e8fa9395243931aa5c,0.811512291,https://knowhy.bookofmormoncentral.org/knowhy/why-were-violent-acts-like-the-mountain-meadows-massacre-committed-by-latter-day-saints#,Why Were Violent Acts like the Mountain Meadows Massacre Committed by Latter-day Saints? / The Why,6,"It was not because of their religion but in spite of it that these men committed this abhorrent act of violence. The gospel of Jesus Christ calls upon disciples to ""do good; seek peace"" (Psalm 34:14) and ""live peaceably with all men"" (Romans 12:18). In His Sermon on the Mount, the Savior said, ""Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God"" (Matthew 5:9). He then taught His disciples to reconcile with adversaries (vv. 21–26), turn the other cheek (v. 39), and ultimately, ""love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you"" (v. 44).

In response to the first wave of persecution and mob violence directed against the Saints in 1833, Joseph Smith received a revelation instructing the Saints to ""renounce war and proclaim peace"" (Doctrine and Covenants 98:16) and to endure persecution patiently and seek to resolve conflicts peacefully before taking up arms in self-defense (D&C 98:23–37). On multiple occasions when local Church leaders from Parowan and Cedar City counseled together regarding the emigrant company at the Mountain Meadows, they encouraged actions that would prevent or deescalate the violence and promote peace. It was only by repeatedly ignoring the judicious and sound decisions of these councils that the massacre was brought about.

Speaking on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of this tragic event, President Henry B. Eyring said:

> The gospel of Jesus Christ that we espouse abhors the cold-blooded killing of men, women, and children. Indeed, it advocates peace and forgiveness. What was done here long ago by members of our Church represents a terrible and inexcusable departure from Christian teaching and conduct. We cannot change what happened, but we can remember and honor those who were killed here.28

Recent years alone have witnessed riots, mass shootings, and war. Such violence is endemic to the human condition. Too often, regular people get swept up in the heat of a moment, and a specific set of conditions leads typically good people to commit unspeakable acts of violence. Regrettably, Latter-day Saints have not been immune to this common human problem.

Violence was an especially prevalent reality on the American frontier in the nineteenth century, where it was often directed toward minority groups, including religious minorities, who were unfairly perceived as the source of various social ills.2 As such, Latter-day Saints were regularly victims of violence in the 1830s and '40s.3, 6–19."") Incidents like the Hawn's Mill Massacre, which was set amid the violent expulsion of Latter-day Saints from Missouri,4."") and the later martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith followed by another violent expulsion—this time from Illinois—had a generational impact upon the Latter-day Saints who endured these injustices and lost loved ones either in the violence or its aftermath.5."")

At times, after repeated acts of violence against them, the Saints responded with violence of their own, which they saw as acts of self-defense. As one trio of historians noted, however, ""The majority could take the law into its own hands with impunity, but when minorities employed the same approach or tried to fight back, it usually backfired.""6 Such acts of aggression tended to confirm the stereotypes about how violent and depraved the ""Mormons"" were and thus escalated the hostilities directed toward them. Still, according to D. Michael Quinn, ""Mormon marauding against non-Mormon Missourians in 1838 was mild by comparison with the brutality of the anti-Mormon militias.""7, 99."")",2.0

Hinckley, First Counselor in the LDS Church First Presidency, offered the prayer dedicating the new monument. In a talk delivered before the prayer, President Hinckley said he came ""not as a descendant of any of the parties involved at Mountain Meadows"" but ""as a representative of an entire people who have suffered much over what occurred there.""

""In our time,"" he said, ""we can read such history as is available, but we really cannot understand nor comprehend that which occurred those tragic and terrible September days in 1857. Rather, we are grateful for the ameliorating influence that has brought us together in a spirit of reconciliation as new generations gather with respect and appreciation one for another. A bridge has been built across a chasm of cankering bitterness. We walk across that bridge and greet one another with a spirit of love, forgiveness, and with hope that there will never be a repetition of anything of the kind.""

It is well documented that Brigham Young's command was to let the travelers pass through in peace, but his advice arrived too late to prevent the killing, and a locally orchestrated cover-up portrayed the crime as solely an Indian depredation. Responding to charges that whites were involved, President Young urged the new governor to investigate, but Governor Cumming maintained that if whites were involved they would be pardoned under the general amnesty granted in 1858. Eventually, as more information came to light, some of the principal participants were excommunicated from the Church and one, John D. Lee, was convicted in federal court and executed.

Though preoccupied by the Civil War, the federal government nonetheless demonstrated interest in Utah Territory. In 1862 Fort Douglas was established on the eastern edge of Salt Lake City, under the leadership of a dedicated anti-Mormon, Patrick Edward Connor. Connor and his troops were charged with guarding transportation routes, but they also published the aggressively anti-Mormon *Union Vedette*, encouraged mining, and promoted non-Mormon immigration to the territory. In 1863 Connor's troops attacked a group of Northern Shoshone Indians on the Bear River in the northern Cache Valley, killing some 250 men, women, and children.",3.0

These officials would then go back to Washington and spread rumors about the Saints, which stirred up further animosity.8 On July 24, 1857, word reached Utah of an approaching army sent by the US government.9."") The intentions of this military force were initially unclear, but given the Saints' past experience with violent persecution, many assumed the worst. The Saints began to prepare for war. Brigham Young and other leaders throughout Utah gave wartime speeches, rallying the Saints to defend themselves and encouraging them to store up any surplus grain, guns, and ammunition.10

Summer was also a time when many people emigrated, and by some reports an especially high volume of emigrants poured into California in 1857. Many wagon trains heading to California would pass through Utah, hoping to restock and resupply on food, ammunition, and other necessities in Salt Lake City and other towns along the trail. Although these wagon trains were generally good for the Utah economy, squabbles between the emigrants passing through and the settled population, including Native Americans, were not uncommon. The heightened tensions in Utah due to the wartime atmosphere served to magnify these petty conflicts in the minds of some of the Saints.11",3.0

John D. Lee was recruited to persuade the Paiutes, who only agreed to do it if Lee led them.18 When Haight convened a council meeting in Cedar City to try to obtain approval for the attack, he was opposed by other local leaders, who forced him to agree to send a messenger to Brigham Young asking how to proceed.19 Before a messenger could be sent, however, an ambush was launched on the emigrants by Lee and some Paiutes. The wagon company circled their wagons in a defensive position and settled in for what became a five-day siege.20

A messenger was still sent to Brigham Young, but before he could return events began to spiral out of control. The emigrants became aware that it was not merely an attack by natives, but that Mormons were involved. Fearing the consequences if word got out that the Mormons had attacked a wagon train, Haight and others determined that they could not allow survivors to escape, but Haight felt he needed permission from William Dame to execute his deadly plan.21

Once again, a council was called in Parowan with Dame and other leaders. But these men did not approve an attack on the emigrants, and instead a plan was made to help the company continue on its way to California.22 Haight believed this was unacceptable. He and one of his counselors privately met with Dame and pressed upon him his fear that letting the emigrants survive to tell of the attack ""would unleash aggression on the southern Mormon settlements.""23 Reports on exactly what was said and agreed to in this meeting are conflicting and uncertain, but Haight came away believing that he had Dame's support for his subsequent actions.24",2.0

Besides a few persons who left the party before the attack, only about eighteen small children were spared. Two years later, seventeen of the children were returned to family members in northwestern Arkansas. Two decades after the tragedy, one of the Mormon settlers who were present at the massacre, John D. Lee, was executed by a firing squad at the Mountain Meadows, symbolically carrying to the grave the responsibility for those who ""were led to do what none singly would have done under normal conditions, and for which none singly can be held responsible"" (Brooks, p. 218).

Yet for more than another century after Lee's death, the community guilt of those who participated in the massacre continued to fester alongside the collective pain of both the children who survived it and the relatives of those who did not. Then in the late 1980s, the descendants of those affected by the tragedy began meeting to bind the wounds and achieve a reconciliation. On September 15, 1990, many of them gathered to dedicate a memorial marker to those who died at the Mountain Meadows.

One speaker at the marker dedication was Judge Roger V. Logan, Jr., of Harrison, Arkansas, a man related to twenty-one of the massacre victims listed on the marker, as well as to five of the children who survived. ""I am happy to say that thanks to the work, cooperation and gifts of many of you,"" he said, ""there is now an appropriate monument standing in the place of the emigrants' demise; a monument containing the names of eighty-two persons who died and seventeen who survived and [that] also contains reference to many others who may have been a part of the caravan.""

Upon his appearance to the Nephites, he stretched forth his hand and spoke unto the people saying:

Perhaps you can understand the immense personal inadequacy I feel and the deep, often painful examination of my soul I have experienced.

Obviously my greatest thrill and the most joyful of all realizations is that I have the opportunity, as Nephi phrased it, to ""talk of Christ, … rejoice in Christ, … preach of Christ, [and] prophesy of Christ"" (2 Ne. 25:26) wherever I may be and with whomever I may find myself until the last breath of my life is gone. Surely there could be no higher purpose or greater privilege than that of ""special [witness] of the name of Christ in all the world"" (D&C 107:23).

But my greatest anxiety stems from that very same commission. A line of scripture reminds us with searing understatement that ""they which preach the gospel should live … the gospel"" (1 Cor. 9:14). Beyond my words and teachings and spoken witness, my life must be part of that testimony of Jesus. My very being should reflect the divinity of this work.

Time dictates that we must now pass by dozens, yes hundreds of references to this Savior of mankind found in this sacred record. Six hundred years escape us. Now we hold time still. We stop to drink deeply and spiritually meditate as we study this scene:

""A great multitude gathered together, of the people of Nephi, round about the temple. …

""And they were also conversing about this Jesus Christ, of whom the sign had been given concerning his death"" (3 Ne. 11:1–2). They heard a voice. Again they heard a voice, and they understood it not.

""And again the third time they did hear the voice, and did open their ears to hear it, and their eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they did look steadfastly towards heaven, from whence the sound came.

Much like the Nephites in 3 Nephi 11, *we need Jesus Christ*. Can you imagine yourself there, among people who had experienced so much chaos and destruction? What would it be like to hear the Lord's personal invitation:

""Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may *thrust* your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may *know* that I am … the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.

""And … the multitude went forth … one by one … and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know … *and had witnessed for themselves*.""1

These Nephites eagerly went forward to thrust their hands into His side and feel the prints of the nails in His hands and feet so they could witness for themselves that this was the Christ. Similarly, many faithful people we have studied in the New Testament this year had anxiously awaited Christ's coming. Then they stepped from their fields, workbenches, and dinner tables and followed Him, pressed upon Him, thronged Him, and sat with Him. Are we as anxious to witness for ourselves as the multitudes in the scriptures? Are the blessings we seek less needful than theirs?

When Christ physically visited the Nephites at their temple, His invitation was not to stand at a distance and look upon Him, but to touch Him, to feel for themselves the reality of the Savior of humankind. How can we draw close enough to gain a personal witness of Jesus Christ? This may be part of what my father was trying to teach me. While we may not enjoy the same physical proximity as those who walked with Christ during His earthly ministry, through the Holy Ghost we can experience His power every day! As much as we need!",1.0

We are created in His very image and likeness,16 and Jesus of Nazareth, His Only Begotten Son in the flesh, came to earth as the perfect mortal manifestation of His grandeur. In addition to the witness of the ancients we also have the modern miracle of Palmyra, the appearance of God the Father and His Beloved Son, the Savior of the world, to the boy prophet Joseph Smith. I testify of that appearance, and in the words of that prophet I, too, declare: ""Our heavenly Father is more liberal in His views, and boundless in His mercies and blessings, than we are ready to believe or receive. … God does not look on sin with [the least degree of] allowance, but … the nearer we get to our heavenly Father, the more we are disposed to look with compassion on perishing souls; we feel that we want to take them upon our shoulders, and cast their sins behind our backs.""17

The whole multitude fell to the earth, and while they were in this attitude of reverence and humility, the Savior blessed them and taught them. His very first act was to commission Nephi to baptize, saying, ""I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven."" (3 Ne. 11:21.)

He also called others, twelve in number, and gave them this power, establishing that it is necessary to have authority to act in the name of the Lord. He gave them the words they should use and instructed them to baptize by immersion as they performed the ordinance of baptism. This is the same form of baptism practiced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Thus, the Nephites used the intimate yet freely spoken name of the mortal Jesus as their name for God, while the ineffable YHWH (see Jehovah, Jesus Christ) appears only twice in the book (2 Ne. 22:2; Moro. 10:34).

Some, such as Sherem, whose cultural roots lay in the monotheistic world of Jerusalem, resisted the worship of the Messiah, alleging that this violated the Law of Moses (Ex. 20:3; Jacob 7:7; see Antichrists). Nephi had previously declared that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost were ""one God"" (2 Ne. 31:21), but Nephite challengers continued to attack the proposition that Jesus was God, to deny that his Atonement could be efficacious in advance of its occurrence, and to argue that there could not be many Gods who were still one God (e.g., Mosiah 17:8; Alma 11:28).

He remembered and wrote it down, but then chose not to use it again until he was nearly finished with his record, after quoting extensively from Isaiah. Then, after reintroducing the name and reminding readers that an angel had revealed it, Nephi went on to use both *Jesus* and *Christ* together 5 more times, and the name *Jesus* alone appears another 3 times.18; 30:5 (2x). For only Jesus, see 2 Nephi 31:10; 33:4, 6."")

Perhaps Nephi chose to begin using the name during his commentary on Isaiah because, in Hebrew, ""The names 'Jesus' and 'Isaiah' are similar in form and meaning.""19, 490. Yesha'yahu (Isaiah) is composed of yesha, which means ""help, deliverance, salvation,"" and then the theophoric yahu, meaning Yahweh. Yeshua (Jesus) is another form of the name Yehoshua (Joshua) and likewise derives from yasha. See Ludwig Koehler and Walter Baumgartner, The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament, trans. M.E.J. Richardson, 2 vols. (Leiden: Brill, 2001), 1:446, 449. See also ""Isaiah,"" ""Jesus,"" and ""Joshua,"" in Book of Mormon Onomasticon, ed. Paul Y. Hoskisson, online at onoma.lib.byu.edu."") Both names are based on the root word *yasha*, meaning *salvation*. It thus may not be a coincidence that right after Nephi reminded readers of the angelically revealed name *Jesus Christ*, Nephi taught the most central doctrine of the Gospel: ""there is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be *saved*"" (2 Nephi 25:30).",1.0

Like the carefully chosen names of Nephi and Lehi, can it be said and written of us that we are true disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ? Do we honor the name of Jesus Christ that we have willingly taken upon ourselves? Are we both ""a minister and a witness""18 of His loving-kindness and His redeeming power?

Not long ago, I was listening to the Book of Mormon. In the last chapter of 2 Nephi, I *heard* Nephi say something that I had never *read* the same way before. All throughout his record, he teaches and testifies of the ""Redeemer,"" the ""Holy One of Israel,"" the ""Lamb of God,"" and the ""Messiah."" But as he closed his account, I heard him say these words: ""I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in *my Jesus,* for he hath redeemed my soul.""19 When I heard these words, my heart rejoiced and I had to listen over and over again. I recognized and responded to that verse just as I recognize and respond to my own name.

The Lord has said, ""Yea, blessed is this people who are willing to bear my name; for in my name shall they be called; and they are mine.""20

As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, may we ""gladly [take upon us] the name of Christ""21 by honoring His name with love, devotion, and good works.

As times and conditions changed, some words used in describing Christ dropped out of the Nephite texts, whereas others became more frequent in usage. Words such as ""Messiah,"" ""Lamb of God,"" and ""Holy One of Israel"" were used often by Lehi, Nephi, and Jacob but rarely by later Book of Mormon writers. The earlier writers tend to connect the Lord more with Israel than do the later authors.

5. The earlier Book of Mormon writers use greater variety in their names for Christ than do the later writers. In the early texts, more forms of expression were used and greater variety exists in their formulations. Of the sixty-seven names researched in this study, Lehi used fifteen, Nephi used thirty-two, and Jacob, nineteen. Nephite religious speech was evidently more varied in the earlier generations when the revelations were new. As Nephite religious practices and culture became more established, standardized forms and conventions of discourse evidently prevailed.

6. Significantly different names for Christ are used by the various writers of the Book of Mormon. Of the sixty-seven names, thirty-seven are used by only one of the ten prophets under examination.

1. These testimonies are true to life. They are corroborated by the credentials of authentic personal experience and complex individual diversity. They make sense historically, and they emerge distinctly even from widely scattered primary sources within individual authors.

2. The testimonies become linguistically more definite as time progresses. Lehi at first spoke of Jesus being ""*a*Messiah,"" ""*a*prophet,"" ""*a* Savior"" (1 Nephi 10:4; emphasis added) or ""*this*Redeemer"" (1 Nephi 10:5; emphasis added), but this designation soon crystallized in Nephi's abridgment as ""*the*Messiah"" (1 Nephi 10:7, 9–10; emphasis added). It is also evident that Lehi was not explicit at first about the meaning of the ""redemption"" of this Messiah. Was it to be a spiritual redemption in the next life, or a physical redemption of the land now or later? This question was raised at least twice by Laman and Lemuel (see 1 Nephi 15:31; 22:1) and finally answered by Nephi: it would be both (see 1 Nephi 22:3).

3. The record often indicates when and how important details about Christ were revealed. The name of ""Christ,"" for example, was told to Jacob by an angel; the name of ""Jesus Christ"" was revealed to Nephi; the extended name, ""Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning,"" was first given to the people by King Benjamin to distinguish them above all people led by the Lord. Nephite knowledge of Christ, like all other facets of revealed knowledge, grew ""line upon line"" (2 Nephi 28:30).",2.0

The name Jehovah vocalized thus is not found in ancient texts, but is a modern convention. In ancient times, the Hebrew text had no vowels; thus the consonants in God's name were *yhwh*. Jews avoided pronouncing these consonants when reading aloud, substituting **adonai*, a word meaning ""the Lord."" Following this practice, King James translators usually rendered* yhwh *as ""the Lord."" In medieval Hebrew texts, the vowels from*** *adonai* were added to the consonants *yhwh* to remind Jewish readers to say ""'*adonai*."" English translators adopted this convention, creating the artificial form ""Jehovah."" Latter-day Saints accept Jehovah as a name for the premortal Christ because this is the common English form for *yhwh*.

**EL.** **El *is not a name, but is the common noun for God in Hebrew (plural,*** *elohim* ). Latter-day Saints often use Elohim for the Father, allowing a distinction between members of the Godhead.

The instruction to take upon oneself the name of Christ is found in several previous Nephite scriptures, including 2 Nephi 31:13; Mosiah 5:8, 10; Mosiah 25:23; Alma 34:38; and Alma 46:18.",2.0

Jesus established this church among us but we don't have a name for it so they're praying when all of a sudden the Lord appears – he came and stood (in verse 2) in the midst of them, and he says ""What will ye that I shall give unto you?"" By the way, just as a side note here, isn't it interesting how often God asks questions of people the answer to which God already knows. But there's something beautiful about him getting people to act, use their agency and to ask before he just comes and gives them things that he already knows better than they do what they need. So here it is again, he's asking them this question and their answer is well we want to know the name whereby we shall call thy church because there are disputations among the people concerning the matter. So there have actually been arguments and maybe contentious debates back and forth. So notice what he says in verse 5: ""Have they not read the scriptures which say that ye must take upon you the name of Christ, which is my name? For by this name shall ye be called at the last day.""

So when establishing his church he's making a really big deal about the name being his own, that you've got to take upon you the name of Christ because name in scripture, especially in antiquity, is associated directly with power.

And so we're so far only talking about the text of the Book of Abraham, but it seems like there's a lot that we don't know, and there's still plenty of room to say that Joseph Smith had these materials, translated either from these materials or was inspired by these materials, that the Book of Abraham comes from God.

Scott Woodward:

Yeah, and that's consistent with his other translation projects, right? Like the Book of Mormon, which was actually written in Reformed Egyptian. By the time Joseph was done translating the Book of Mormon, he still couldn't read Reformed Egyptian. At the end of the day, it came by the gift and power of God. It came by revelation. He got revelation through the use of seer stones, and there was little, if any, actually looking at the text of the Book of Mormon plates, right? He's not running his finger along the hieroglyphs, as far as any eyewitnesses say. He's actually just getting revelation through the instruments that were prepared for that purpose, as he focuses his faith on the plates themselves, right, and asks for revelation to come. So that's the Book of Mormon.

Casey Paul Griffiths:

Yeah. And the same with the Bible. When he translates the Bible, he's not claiming that he has the original manuscripts or that he can see them in vision. He is saying, by the means of the Holy Spirit, I am translating, and that's the word he uses, translating. So all this is consistent. All this is totally consistent.

The parchment of John that we just talked about in D&C 7, again, Joseph never claimed to be able to read Greek.

Right? Revelation. Here's John Whitmer, early church historian. He records in July 1835 that Joseph Smith, ""by the revelation of Jesus Christ could translate these records, which gave an account of our forefathers, even Abraham."" So John Whitmer is at least recording what Joseph Smith was claiming, right? And this is not surprising. This is Joseph Smith's M. O. It's by revelation. And you quoted Warren Parrish earlier, that he says that Joseph, ""claimed to receive it by direct inspiration of heaven."" He's talking very much as an antagonist, but the story is consistent. Joseph claimed to translate the Book of Abraham the same way he ever claimed to translate anything, which was by revelation, not by learning the underlying source language, right? He's not learning Egyptian, Reformed Egyptian, Greek, anything like that. It's just by the gift and power of God. That's how Joseph always claimed to translate.

Casey Paul Griffiths:

A major question about its authenticity continues to revolve around whether Joseph Smith translated the work from the papyrus fragments the Church now has in its possession or whether he used the Urim and Thummim to receive the text of the book of Abraham by revelation, as is the case with the translation of the scroll of John the Revelator, found in Doctrine and Covenants section 7,or the Book of Moses, which is excerpted from the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible and is also found in the Pearl of Great Price. From these examples, it is evident that for Joseph Smith it was not necessary to possess an original text in order to have its translation revealed to him. In his function as prophet, seer, and revelator, many channels were open to him to receive information by divine inspiration.

The text is a catalyst

The entirety of what Joseph had was, indeed, nothing more than common Egyptian funerary texts, yet these texts started the ball rolling for a series of revelations that constitute the Book of Abraham, much in the same way the Book of Moses was received by revelation as Joseph read Genesis in the Old Testament.

So which of these positions is right? I don't think it's that cut and dried. My personal position has more in common with possibility #2 than any of the other two, but there are elements from #3, and even

#1, that cannot be entirely dismissed.

There is a fourth alternative, too, one that probably represents the majority opinion of members of the Church. That opinion is as follows:

* 4. It's scripture, so who cares?.

I do not share the second part of that opinion, but I emphatically share the first part. The Book of Abraham is arguably the most profound book of scripture we have in our possession, and the doctrines found therein define the relationship between God and his children in a way radically at odds with orthodox Christian thought and in a way that is wholly, uniquely Mormon. The importance of the idea that each of us, at our core, is co-eternal with God, cannot be overstated. The concept of pre-existence, the eternal nature of matter and the rejection of Ex Nihilo creation – all of that comes from the Book of Abraham, and, while hints of it can be found in the other standard works, nothing approaching the clarity and beauty of these magnificent truths can be found anywhere else.

The doctrine of Creatio Ex Nihilo, or Creation Out of Nothing, is central to much of the Christian world. As I understand it, the idea is that there was nothing in the universe, or even no universe itself. There was only God. And at one point, God decided He wanted there to be
Something instead of Nothing. And so, out of Nothing, he made Something, and voila! Here we are!",1.0

Belief that he was a real person is shared by others, but the LDS approach is unique: Revelations received by the Prophet Joseph Smith confirm the basic historicity of Genesis and add information echoed in ancient sources, many of which have emerged since his day.

The book of Abraham as restored by Joseph Smith autobiographically recounts Abraham's early life, explaining why he was singled out as the pivotal recipient of divine promises for the blessing of mankind. Not only had he been foreordained in premortal life (Abr. 3:23; cf. *Apocalypse of Abraham* 22:1-5), but as a young man in Ur he opposed idolatry and human sacrifice, ironically turning him into an intended victim (Abr. 1:5-20; cf. *Genesis Rabbah* 38:13). The irony increases when God's last-minute rescue of Abraham foreshadowed what would transpire at Abraham's offering of Isaac.

After marrying Sarah and learning of his lineal right to the patriarchal order of the priesthood as disclosed in the ""records of the fathers"" (Abr. 1:2-4, 26, 31;2:2; *Jubilees* 12:27; cf. D&C 107:40-57), Abraham traveled to Haran, where he apparently received his ordination (Abr. 2:9-11; *WJS*, pp. 245, 303). He also saw the Lord, who gave him remarkable promises: Abraham would be blessed above measure; his posterity would carry the gospel to all nations; and all who received it would bear his name, be accounted his posterity, and bless him as their father (Abr. 2:6-11; cf. Gen. 12:1-3).",0.0

Even Joseph Fielding Smith says as much on that very same page in *Doctrines of Salvation* that Faulk references here. It was the same page I cited above when describing Smith's ""hearsay"" and ""errors"" quotes:

*The statement has been made that the Urim and Thummim was on the altar of the Manti Temple when that building was dedicated.

For example, even eyewitness participants in the translation of the Book of Mormon sometimes confused the terminology in their descriptions of the event. ""These two instruments—the interpreters and the seer stone—were apparently interchangeable and worked in much the same way such that, in the course of time, Joseph Smith and his associates often used the term 'Urim and Thummim' to refer to the single stone as well as the interpreters.""7

Despite these ambiguities, it is clear that Joseph utilized sacred instruments—in this case seer stones that he found or the interpreters, which Moroni gave him—that had been prepared by the Lord for the purpose of translating the Book of Mormon. Questions remain as to how Joseph used these instruments, such as when precisely he used which devices during the translation process.

As he goes on to say, this was because he believed so intently in the statements made in Ether 3:22-24 and by the Angel Moroni that the Nephite interpreters were preserved for the translation that he didn't think it was possible that Joseph would use other stones for convenience's sake.

More work has been done in this area since President Smith's tenure as leader of this Church. We obviously know more now about the translation process than he did. He was mistaken. It happens. It was also probably a lapse in judgment to state his opinion so directly when there was a chance others would see it as revelation rather than opinion.

However, he did clarify that it was his personal belief that it was incorrect. He also said that reports of Joseph using the Urim and Thummim after the plates were given back to Moroni were ""evidently"" errors. And he was right that all of the accounts including this information are from people other than Joseph himself. Technically, they *could* be classified as ""hearsay,"" though many of the accounts were given firsthand from people who witnessed the translation unfolding in front of their own eyes.

He maybe should have taken his position and audience into account when giving his opinion, but he was clear that it *was* his opinion. His statements were not nearly as forceful as critics would have us believe. They aren't even as forceful as Faulk himself, who has so far made *several* declarations of fact that were incorrect. And frankly, President Smith was entitled to hold those opinions. We know now that he was mistaken, but that doesn't lessen his calling as a prophet.

Not only did David Whitmer observe the miraculous translation unfold day after day, but he also saw Joseph's human weakness. Ironically, that very weakness offered evidence that the Prophet's extraordinary ability was indeed a *gift* from God; it could be taken away when he wasn't worthy of it, just as the Book of Mormon warns.

Similarly, when Martin Harris discreetly swapped out Joseph's seer stone for an average rock of similar appearance, Joseph saw only darkness—just as Martin expected and just as the Book of Mormon predicted. From his own experience, Martin came to believe that something really was special about Joseph Smith's revelatory instruments.

I just want to say that to all of our listeners here, if you're like most people who live in this age of enlightenment, then the idea that a 23-year-old Joseph Smith translated an ancient record by looking at rocks in the bottom of his hat can feel uneasy, and it can strain the belief gene, you know? And so to those in that camp I say I understand you. I'll say that what helped me believe that such a thing was possible is the actual text of the Book of Mormon itself. As I've read the Book of Mormon carefully, examined its complexity, its beauty, its compelling witness of Christ, and then studying the eyewitness accounts we've been talking about, repeatedly and consistently that he had no manuscripts, he had nothing, he was looking at rocks in the bottom of his hat while he was doing this translation—he would read and we would write, and that's it. Like, that's how it worked. When I think about that, I think, well, if that kind of a book with that beauty and complexity and compelling witness, came through a 23-year-old seer looking at seer stones in his hat, then I guess I'm a believer in seer stones. Right? I'm as much a child of the enlightenment as any listener here. I've never seen anything close to anyone work with seer stones, but I've read the Book of Mormon, and for me the proof is in the end product, right? That product sings. So the evidence, when carefully examined for me, is highly, highly suspicious of a miracle. I believe that's the best way to explain it, is that this was a miracle.",1.0

The Book of Mormon stands as a miraculous work for the world to examine. This divine spark from heaven, over 165 years ago, has ignited a flame that is dawning a new day. No wonder ""the Spirit of God like a fire is burning!"" (*Hymns,* 1985, no. 2). All over the world people are seeking the witness of Jesus Christ as found in the Book of Mormon. They come from every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. As was revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, ""The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name"" (D&C 122:1). And why are they seeking after the name of Joseph Smith? Because the Book of Mormon testifies of the divinity and atonement of the Savior, Jesus Christ. Because Joseph is the prophet of the Restoration.

With deep appreciation for the miracle that transpired through the translation of the Book of Mormon, we sing:

*Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah!*

*Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer.*

*Blessed to open the last dispensation. …*

*Millions shall know ""Brother Joseph"" again.*

(*Hymns,* 1985, no. 27)

I testify that the translation miracle of the Book of Mormon clearly evidences that Joseph is a prophet of God, called to ""lay the foundation of [Christ's] church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth"" (D&C 1:30). The Book of Mormon is the ""keystone of our religion"" and will bring us ""nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book"" (*Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,* p. 194). May we appreciate this miraculous translation, and may it be our desire to come to know and follow the Savior through his teachings in the Book of Mormon, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",0.0

*In frontier America, seer stones or ""peep stones"" were commonly used by lost object finders, people engaged in the widespread practice of lost treasure digging, and sometimes by people seeking to uncover the kind of truths we might call a private or police detective for today. It is unclear how much of this kind of activity Joseph Smith was involved in, except for water divining and treasure digging, which are widely attested. The ""seer"" in seer stone is a biblically literate early American culture's reference to the biblical term* seer *explained in 1 Samuel 9:9 as an earlier term for a prophet—more specifically one who saw visions, dreams, or scenes in the mind's eye, or even with the natural eyes. Moreover, God gives the seer insight into the meaning of his or her visions (2 Sam. 24:11; 2 Chr. 9:29; Jer. 1:11–18). All of this fits quite nicely with how Joseph Smith saw himself.*

*To Bible scholars, the Urim and Thummim is one of several items similar to the* ephod *and* lots *used to determine the will of God or seek information from him. (The Liahona in the Book of Mormon follows this pattern.) It seems that early Mormons began to use the terms* seer stone *and* Urim and Thummim *interchangeably, with the latter convention winning the day.

It contains the first ever, official image of one of Joseph Smith's seer stones. It is the very same stone Joseph found while digging a well on the property of Willard Chase in 1822.***

There are actually multiple stories of how Joseph discovered his stones, and some of them conflict. Mark Ashurst-McGee traces much of the history and clarifies many of the conflicted stories in his Master's thesis, which is archived at Book of Mormon Central. The *Ensign* article in question does not specify exactly how Joseph came to be in possession of this particular stone.

According to Ashurst-McGee, he seems to have discovered the brown stone first by looking into his neighbor Sally Chase's seer stone, and then discovered the *white* stone second, in the Chase property well. He also eventually found two others in and around Nauvoo.

The white stone is the one that Martin claimed Joseph used to find lost objects, including a pin Martin had dropped into a pile of straw and wood shavings. It also appears to be this stone that Martin switched, leaving Joseph temporarily unable to translate. However, later translation witnesses described Joseph using his brown stone. So, he potentially used at least four stones to translate the plates: the white one, the brown one, and the two Nephite interpreters.

Essentially, the brown seer stone pictured in the *Ensign* article is *not* ""the very same stone Joseph found while digging in a well on the property of Willard Chase in 1822."" However, it *is* one of two of Joseph's personal seer stones potentially used during the translation process.",0.0

Yeah, yeah. So there's this mysterious thing called the First Presidency Vault. And I have a friend whose grandfather was the executive secretary of the First Presidency. He gave me a list. This list is well-known, it's not hard to find, of things that are in the First Presidency's vault. And among them were several seer stones, and I'm guessing most of these seer stones don't have a clear provenance. The most likely explanation is that some family brought them to the first presidency and said ""Hey, this is a seer stone. It's legit,"" and the First Presidency kind of said, ""Okay. Well, we'll set it aside,"" because they've only given attention to the brown seer stone, and that's because with any object you have to test its provenance. If someone comes up to you and says, ""Hey, I've got George Washington's hat."" I wouldn't pay a lot of money for that without saying, ""Can you prove to me that it's his hat?"" With this seer stone, the provenance is fairly brief. It's just Joseph to Oliver to Elizabeth to Phineas to Brigham, which is incredibly brief. And it's been in church possession more or less since the 1850s. The other ones don't have any kind of clear sense of provenance. And so they're there, and that's interesting, but I wouldn't associate any historical events with these other seer stones, if that makes sense.

The fact remains that the exact nature of the flood is not known. We set up assumptions, based upon our best knowledge, but can go no further. We should remember that when inspired writers deal with historical incidents they relate that which they have seen or that which may have been told them, unless indeed the past is opened to them by revelation.

The details in the story of the flood are undoubtedly drawn from the experiences of the writer. Under a downpour of rain, likened to the opening of the heavens, a destructive torrent twenty-six feet deep or deeper would easily be formed. The writer of Genesis made a faithful report of the facts known to him concerning the flood. In other localities the depth of the water might have been more or less.

Heavenly Father clearly feels that the exact details are less important than the lessons we can learn from this story, and He hasn't seen fit to clarify the matter.

There are massive ziggurats and their ruins all over Mesopotamia even today, including an especially large one in what was once ancient Babylon, and one of them easily could have been the Tower of Babel. So, just like the Flood, the confusion of languages at the tower could have been a localized event (the Hebrew word for ""earth"" that was used in that story also could have meant ""land""). It also could have been symbolic. The only things that we know for certain is that it was not a worldwide confusion of languages, and that the Jaredites fled from the Tower so that their own language would not be corrupted.",2.0

The Church bears his name because it is his church. He commanded the Nephites to ""call the church in my name. …

He warned that failure to heed his message would bring the floods upon his hearers (D&C 138:41; Moses 8:24).

Noah was ""perfect in his generation; and he walked with God"" (Moses 8:27). Like Adam, he received dominion over the earth and all living things (*HC* 3:386).

Noah stands ""next in authority to Adam in the Priesthood"" (*HC* 3:386), and ""in third position from the Lord"" (Petersen, p. 2), and conferred the power of the priesthood on his righteous posterity (D&C 84:14-15).

Eighteen centuries after announcing Christ's birth, Noah-again as Gabriel-visited the Prophet Joseph Smith to restore priesthood keys (D&C 128:21). Noah is to return to earth after Christ's second coming to attend the Marriage Supper of the Lamb (D&C 27:5-7).

* ***Global flood******: 4,500 years ago***

The great flood didn't have to be global. That was in the days before cars, trains, planes, etc. It was not common for people to travel long distances when it would have had to have been on foot, camel, or horseback. For many people, traveling more than a few hundred miles in any direction during the course of their lifetimes would have been unthinkable. So, it would have been natural for a large local flood to seem like it flooded the entire world.

When Church leaders refer to it, they do tend to refer to it as a global flood because that's what the scriptures say. But they also occasionally say otherwise. For example, in the *Encyclopedia of Mormonism*, John A. Widtsoe is quoted as saying:

> *The fact remains that the exact nature of the flood is not known. We set up assumptions, based upon our best knowledge, but can go no further. We should remember that when inspired writers deal with historical incidents they relate that which they have seen or that which may have been told them, unless indeed the past is opened to them by revelation. The details in the story of the flood are undoubtedly drawn from the experiences of the writer. Under a downpour of rain, likened to the opening of the heavens, a destructive torrent twenty-six feet deep or deeper would easily be formed. The writer of Genesis made a faithful report of the facts known to him concerning the flood. In other localities the depth of the water might have been more or less. In fact, the details of the flood are not known to us*.

### FAIR's Response

#### Fact checking results: The author has stated erroneous information or misinterpreted their sources

 The Church does not require a belief in a global flood, despite BYU professor Donald W. Parry's article in the *Ensign*. What the Church teaches is that Noah was a real prophet, and that he was commanded to save his family along with a number of animals in an ark from a flood which covered his world.

In Moses 6:28 the Lord explained to Enoch that He would send the flood because ""in [the people's] own abominations have they devised murder, and have not kept the commandments."" These ""abominations"" were first introduced by Cain, who slew his brother Abel (Moses 5:25). In response to Cain's murder, the Lord declared, ""The voice of thy brother's blood cries unto me from the ground"" (v. 35).

Thus, in both accounts, the floods were sent because of ""abominations"" which are scripturally linked with the shedding of innocent blood—blood which symbolically calls out from the ground for divine justice.13."") The Lord wanted the people to understand that He was bound by His own law to exact justice for the spilling of innocent blood. The rising waters symbolically hid the people's wickedness and abominations from before the face of the Lord,14. See also 2 Nephi 9:14, Mormon 9:5; Lamentations 1:8; Isaiah 47:3; Revelation 3:18.

This type of literary repetition and borrowing found in separate stories can be seen in the Bible as well. For instance, aspects of the construction of the Israelite tabernacle have been found to mirror Noah's construction of the Ark, which in turn mirrors the creation of the world.44

In a similar way, the story of the Jaredite exodus found in the book of Ether may intentionally hark back to stories of a previous flood hero, some of which may have been known to the brother of Jared and his people. It is possible, and potentially useful, to read the brother of Jared's experience as a refutation or correction to Mesopotamian views about gods and man. Importantly, the non-biblical flood stories were only published in English after the translation of the Book of Mormon, making them inaccessible to Joseph Smith.",1.0

Faithful Latter-day Saints should not be afraid to honestly admit that DNA analysis is inconclusive. The Book of Mormon holds up well under scrutiny and does not need to be propped up by improper use of science. While genetic studies do not offer the evidence some have hoped for, many other disciplines such as archaeology, anthropology, linguistics, geography, geology, literary studies, and ancient legal studies continue to yield fruitful evidence which both supports and sheds light on Book of Mormon narratives.21.

The DNA argument may sound like a solid scientific argument against the Book of Mormon, but in reality it has no teeth. The smartest critics are painfully aware of this fact. To add teeth (more like dentures) to their charge, the critics hitch their arguments to statements made by 19th century church leaders who believed that the descendants of Book of Mormon people account for all or most all of the ancient Americans. Unfortunately for the critics, Latter-day Saints don't believe that an LDS prophet suddenly becomes a robot who is unable to have his own thoughts and opinions (even if those opinions are wrong).

Scholarly studies clearly indicate that the Book of Mormon peoples were a small clan who migrated into the larger population of existing ancient American cultures. Under such conditions (and this is even admitted by the critics), their DNA markers would likely disappear.",3.0

Simply assuming it looked like DNA from the modern Middle East can be deeply misleading. A common problem in population genetics, known as *founder effect*, appears when the founders of a population had atypical genetic markers for the region they came from. For instance, an LDS geneticist from Italy found that his paternal genetic marker was more typical of East Asian ancestry. If something similar was the case with the founders of Book of Mormon populations, identifying their descendants using DNA would be impossible.10, 179–192. ""Unfortunately, no matter how large or small they eventually became as a people in the American continent, Lehi's family still was a very small initial group with extremely limited genetic variation that would not constitute a large enough sample of their native population to ensure that their genetics would be properly represented in the New World"" (p. 186)."")

Even if Jared's, Mulek's, and Lehi's DNA were typical of the regions of their origins, the reality is that most genetic information from the past does not survive into present populations. Most DNA studies on Native Americans are dependent upon DNA markers which pass from one generation to the next along paternal and maternal lines. Because such markers do not get mixed from one generation to the next, these lineages are easy to trace back several generations. However, in total they only represent 0.01 percent of a person's DNA.11, 249."")",3.0

Finally, the unmentioned presence of other peoples should help us remember why the Book of Mormon was written in the first place. Nephi explained, ""I do not write anything upon plates save it be that I think it be sacred"" (1 Nephi 19:6).17,"" KnoWhy 74 (April 8, 2016)."")

In essence, the Book of Mormon is a spiritual and religious history. Its focus is on particular groups of people, their sacred revelations, and their miraculous experiences. It was never meant to be a cultural survey of the Nephites and Jaredites, or any of the others who interacted with them. Its narrow spiritual focus can help us remember to similarly prioritize spiritual things—especially the realty and teachings of Jesus Christ—in our own lives.

As Elder Russell M. Nelson explained,

> Some authors have focused upon [the Book of Mormon's] stories, its people, or its vignettes of history. Others have been intrigued by its language structure or its records of weapons, geography, animal life, techniques of building, or systems of weights and measures.

 The implication by the author is that the Church retreated from the definition of ""Lamanite"" by altering the introduction to the Book of Mormon that was added in the 1920's. This is incorrect. If Lehi's people intermarried with *anyone* from the existing New World population, then by definition they are certainly among the ancestors of every native American currently living, and thus qualify under the Church's definition of ""Lamanite."" The only way critics can make the DNA data to be a weapon against the Book of Mormon is to *force* a hemispheric interpretation of an empty North and South American continent at the time of arrival of the Lehites. This is why critics *must*, at all costs, negate the Limited Geography Theory of the Book of Mormon.

We don't have any idea what Sariah's lineage was, or Zoram's, or Ishmael's wife's.

Given all of that, we have absolutely no idea what the genetic makeup of the groups in the Book of Mormon even looked like to begin with, let alone what it might look like when it's mixed with existing Native populations.

As the Church's Gospel Topics essay on DNA says, ""It is possible that each member of the emigrating parties described in the Book of Mormon had DNA typical of the Near East, but it is likewise possible that some of them carried DNA more typical of other regions. In this case, their descendants might inherit a genetic profile that would be unexpected given their family's place of origin. This phenomenon is called the founder effect.""",3.0

Thus, some Nauvoo Masons thought of the Endowment as a restoration of a ritual only imperfectly preserved in Freemasonry and viewed Joseph Smith as a master of the underlying principles and allegorical symbolism (Heber C. Kimball to Parley P. Pratt, June 17, 1842, Church Archives). The philosophy and major tenets of Freemasonry are not fundamentally incompatible with the teaching, theology, and doctrines of the Latter-day Saints. Both emphasize morality, sacrifice, consecration, and service, and both condemn selfishness, sin, and greed. Furthermore, the aim of Masonic ritual is to instruct-to make truth available so that man can follow it.

Resemblances between the two rituals are limited to a small proportion of actions and words; indeed, some find that the LDS Endowment has more similarities with the Pyramid texts and the Coptic documents than with Freemasonry. Even where the two rituals share symbolism, the fabric of meanings is different. In addition to creation and life themes, one similarity is that both call for the participants to make covenants. Yet, the Endowment alone ties covenants to eternal blessings and to Jesus Christ. The Masonic ceremony does not emphasize priesthood or the need to be commissioned by God to represent him. The active participation of God in the world and in men's lives is a distinctly LDS temple motif. While Masons believe in an undefined, impersonal God, everything in the LDS Endowment emanates from, or is directed to, God who is a personage and man's eternal Father. The Endowment looks to the eternities and to eternal lives, but Freemasonry is earthbound, pervaded by human legend and hope for something better.",3.0

> *Joseph seems to have used Masonry as a point of departure, a beginning rather than an end in itself. Several scholars of differing degrees of belief in Joseph Smith's teachings have analyzed the evidence and arrived at this conclusion. Michael Homer argued that ""the rituals of Freemasonry provided a starting point for the Mormon prophet's revelation of 'true Masonry.'"" David Buerger argued that the pattern of resemblances was too great and the content of the endowment too unique to explain simply. ""Thus,"" he concluded, ""the temple ceremony cannot be explained as wholesale borrowing from Masonry; neither can it be explained as completely unrelated to Freemasonry."" Allen Roberts concluded that ""Joseph's Masonry was not a conventional one. He attempted to restore it in much the same way the gospel was restored. That is, he saw Masonry like Christianity, as possessing some important truths which could be beneficially extracted from what was otherwise an apostate institution.""*

So, here's what it all really boils down to: yes, there are some elements of Masonic ceremony in the endowment. But those elements link back at least to early Christianity, and some are far older than that. Additionally, those elements are small things, like signs, tokens, symbols, minor phrasing, and the fact that there's a ritual drama to teach us important lessons. They do not include the lessons themselves or the ordinances and covenants.",3.0

Kimball, a Mason himself and a member of the First Presidency for 21 years, made the following statement:",4,"And, as a matter of fact, there are many ancient Christian practices that are similar to Masonic ceremonies, such as the signs and symbols of the Catholic Liturgy. While I don't know if we can state it as verifiable fact, there is evidence that the early Christians had the endowment. Those early ceremonies, as well as ancient Hebrew temple ceremonies, have strong similarities to our endowment today, which points to there being some commonality. Long before he became a Mason, Joseph knew he would be allowed to restore very, very ancient ordinances, going back to the days of Adam. Even more than that, the Lord Himself declared that those ordinances, and the way in which they are performed, have existed since ""before the foundation of the world.""

With those symbols, ceremonies, and clothing being so old, is it any wonder that they may have become corrupted as they've been passed down by different apostate groups? Particularly after the Great Apostasy, when the authority to preach and administer those ordinances was taken away and there was no prophet to correct their usage, so people were left to their own memories and interpretations of them? And is it surprising at all that a secular fraternal organization with roots in medieval Christianity might use some version of those same symbols and ceremonies in its practice, despite not being religious in nature?

The abstract to a fantastic article in the Interpreter by Jeffrey Bradshaw states the following:

> *Joseph Smith taught that the origins of modern temple ordinances go back beyond the foundation of the world. * *Even for believers, the claim that rites known anciently have been restored through revelation raises complex questions because we know that revelation almost never occurs in a vacuum. Rather, it comes most often through reflection on the impressions of immediate experience, confirmed and elaborated through subsequent study and prayer. *",3.0

Modified over centuries, these rituals existed in some form among ancient Egyptians, Coptic Christians, Israelites, and Masons, and in the Catholic and Protestant liturgies. Common elements include the wearing of special clothing, ritualistic speech, the dramatization of archetypal themes, instruction, and the use of symbolic gestures. One theme common to many-found in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the Egyptian pyramid texts, and Coptic prayer circles, for example-is man's journey through life and his quest, following death, to successfully pass the sentinels guarding the entrance to eternal bliss with the gods. Though these ceremonies vary greatly, significant common points raise the possibility of a common remote source.

The Egyptian pyramid texts, for example, feature six main themes: (1) emphasis on a primordial written document behind the rites; (2) purification (including anointing, lustration, and clothing); (3) the Creation (resurrection and awakening texts); (4) the garden (including tree and ritual meal motifs); (5) travel (protection, a ferryman, and Osirian texts); and (6) ascension (including victory, coronation, admission to heavenly company, and Horus texts). Like such ancient ceremonies, the LDS temple Endowment presents aspects of these themes in figurative terms. It, too, presents, not a picture of immediate reality, but a model setting forth the pattern of human life on earth and the divine plan of which it is part.

Masonic ceremonies are also allegorical, depicting life's states-youth, manhood, and old age-each with its associated burdens and challenges, followed by death and hoped-for immortality. There is no universal agreement concerning when Freemasonry began. Some historians trace the order's origin to Solomon, Enoch, or even Adam. Others argue that while some Masonic symbolism may be ancient, as an institution it began in the Middle Ages or later.",3.0

In the temple Endowment all covenants are between the individual and God. In Freemasonry, testing, grading, penalizing, or sentencing accords with the rules of the fraternity or membership votes. In the Endowment, God alone is the judge. Within Freemasonry, rank and promotions are of great importance, while in the LDS temple rites there are no distinctions: all participants stand equal before God. The clash between good and evil, including satan's role, is essential to, and vividly depicted in, the Endowment, but is largely absent from Masonic rites. Temple ceremonies emphasize salvation for the dead through vicarious ordinance work, such as baptism for the dead; nothing in Masonic ritual allows for proxies acting on behalf of the dead. Women participate in all aspects of LDS temple rites; though Freemasonry has women's auxiliaries, Masonic ritual excludes them. The Endowment's inclusion of females underscores perhaps the most fundamental difference between the two rites: LDS temple rites unite husbands and wives, and their children, in eternal families (see Eternal Lives, Eternal Increase; Marriage). Latter-day Saint sealings would be completely out of place in the context of Masonic ceremonies.

Thus, Latter-day Saints see their temple ordinances as fundamentally different from Masonic and other rituals and think of similarities as remnants from an ancient original.

1. The Restoration is a process, not an event, and will continue until the Lord comes again.
2. The ultimate objective of the gathering of Israel15 is to bring the blessings of the temple to God's faithful children.
3. As we seek how to accomplish *that* objective more effectively, the Lord reveals more insights. The ongoing Restoration needs ongoing revelation.

The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have often asked the Lord if there are better ways to take the blessings of the temple to His faithful children. We seek guidance regularly on how to ensure worldwide accuracy and consistency of temple instruction, covenants, and ordinances despite differences in language and culture.

Under the Lord's direction and in answer to our prayers, recent procedural adjustments have been made. *He* is the One who wants you to understand with great clarity exactly what you are making covenants to do. *He* is the One who wants you to experience fully *His* sacred ordinances. *He* wants you to comprehend your privileges, promises, and responsibilities. *He* wants you to have spiritual insights and awakenings you've never had before. This He desires for *all* temple patrons, no matter where they live.

Current adjustments in temple procedures, and others that will follow, are continuing evidence that the Lord is actively directing His Church. He is providing opportunities for each of us to bolster our spiritual foundations more effectively by centering our lives on Him and on the ordinances and covenants of His temple. When you bring your temple recommend, a contrite heart, and a seeking mind to the Lord's house of learning, *He* will teach you.",0.0

Temples have been part of *this* dispensation from its earliest days.8 Elijah committed the keys of sealing authority to Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple. The fulness of the priesthood was restored in the Nauvoo Temple.9

Until his martyrdom, Joseph Smith continued to receive revelations that furthered the restoration of the endowment and sealing ordinances.10 He recognized, however, that further refinement was needed. After administering the endowment to Brigham Young in May 1842, Joseph told Brigham, ""This is not arranged right, but we have done the best we could under the circumstances in which we are placed, and I wish you to take this matter in hand and organize and systematize all these ceremonies.""11

Following the Prophet's death, President Young oversaw the completion of the Nauvoo Temple12 and later built temples in the Utah Territory. At the dedication of the lower stories of the St. George Temple, Brigham Young vigorously declared the urgency of vicarious temple work when he said, ""When I think upon this subject, I want the tongues of seven thunders to wake up the people.""13",1.0

In footnote 14 to that Interpreter article, Bradshaw elaborates on this:

> *The history of Masonry as an institution is not currently documented before the late 1300s (A. Prescott, Old Charges; J. A. M. Snoek et al., History of Freemasonry, p. 14) and (notwithstanding the fantastic claims of best-sellers) the first suggestion of a link between chivalry and Freemasonry does not occur until 1723 (P. Mollier, Freemasonry and Templarism, pp. 83–84).*
>
>
> *That said, few scholars would disagree that many of Freemasonry's ideas and ritual components drew on ideas from ancient sources, especially early Christianity (see, e.g., M. B. Brown,**Exploring**, pp. 45–55). Indeed in 1766, in one of the earliest exposés of Masonry, Bérage,**Les Plus Secrets Mystères**, p. ix went so far as to say: ""the mysteries of Masonry … are nothing more than those of the Christian religion.""*
>
>
> *Though Old Testament themes are pervasive in Masonic ritual, it seems clear that they come by way of Christian tradition. As R. J. Van Pelt,**Freemasonry and Judaism**, pp. 189-190 observes: ""There is no evidence that the most important Old Testament stories, themes and symbols that found their way into Freemasonry were directly derived from the Tanakh [= the Hebrew Bible]. … In fact, they are clearly derived from the King James translation of the Bible. Therefore these are all examples of a Christian legacy.""*

> *As a result of several factors, Masonry later moved away to a degree from its explicitly Christian roots and welcomed all believers in a higher power. However, in Joseph Smith's time its rituals remained highly Christian in their character.*

These matters include: 1) the narrative backbone, clothing, and covenants of the modern temple endowment, especially as described in the book of Moses (1830-1831); 2) the sequence of blessings of the oath and covenant of the priesthood described in D&C 84 (1832); and 3) priesthood keys and symbols expressed in keywords, names, signs, and tokens (from 1829).**""**

Matthew Brown elaborates on this in his book. There's an entire chapter devoted to the evidences and symbols of the endowment that preceded Joseph's becoming a Mason, which reads, in part:

> *The theory that Joseph Smith took ritual elements from the Freemasons in order to create the LDS temple ceremony is principally founded upon the concept of time. Supporters of this theory argue that since the Prophet joined the Masonic fraternity shortly before he introduced the Nauvoo endowment among the Saints—and because there are similarities between the two sets of ceremonies—the leader of the Mormons must have been guilty of unacknowledged borrowing from the Masons.*

God speaks to us in ways we'll understand. Sometimes, that's done through adapting things we're already familiar with to teach us divine concepts. That's precisely what He did with Joseph's seer stones, after all.

Is it really that surprising that He might inspire Joseph to do the same thing when trying to teach the endowment to the Saints? Because it seems like Joseph was using those Masonic elements to teach eternal principles to the Saints who were already familiar with those ceremonies.

Jeffrey Bradshaw explains:

> *Evidence suggests that Joseph Smith encouraged Nauvoo Masonry at least in part to help those who would later receive temple ordinances. For instance, Joseph Fielding, an endowed member of the Church who joined Freemasonry in Nauvoo, said: ""Many have joined the Masonic institution. This seems to have been a stepping stone or preparation for something else, the true origin of Masonry"" — i.e., in ancient priesthood ordinances.*
>
>
> *One aspect of this preparation apparently had to do with the general idea of respecting covenants of confidentiality. For example, Joseph Smith once told the Saints that ""the reason we do not have the secrets of the Lord revealed unto us is because we do not keep them."" But as he later observed, '""The secret of Masonry is to keep a secret."" Joseph may have seen the secret-keeping of Masonry as a tool to prepare the Saints to respect their temple covenants.*

These included specific ritual terms, language, handclasps, and gestures as well as larger patterns such as those involving repetition and the use of questions and answers as an aid to teaching. Joseph Smith's own exposure to Masonry no doubt led him to seek further revelation as he prepared to introduce the divine ordinances of Nauvoo temple worship.*

> *… Endowed members saw the Nauvoo temple ordinances as something more than what they had experienced as part of Masonic ritual. Hyrum Smith, a longtime Mason, expressed the typical view of the Saints about the superlative nature of the temple blessings when he said: ""I cannot make a comparison between the house of God and anything now in existence. Great things are to grow out of that house; there is a great and mighty power to grow out of it; there is an endowment; knowledge is power, we want knowledge.""*

Its philosophies were preached from the pulpit and helped to promote ideals based on the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man that were dear to Joseph Smith. Its influence could be felt in diverse areas ranging from art and architecture to social and institutional practices. Importantly, Joseph Smith's exposure to Masonic ritual was no doubt a spur to further revelation as the Nauvoo temple ordinances took shape under his prophetic authority. But whatever suggestions may have come to Joseph Smith through his experience with Masonry, what he did with those suggestions through his prophetic gifts was seen by the Saints as transformative, not merely derivative.*

Define ""links."" You would be correct to say that it's impossible to demonstrate that the rituals of Masonry have been handed down from the time of Solomon in an unbroken chain. You would be incorrect to say that Masons have not appropriated their understanding of ancient practices into their ceremony. The ""link,"" then, would not be a passed-down line of authority but one of similar ideas, many of which the Masons undoubtedly got wrong but a few, apparently, they got right.

Although more a Church folklore, with origins from comments made by early Mormon Masons such as Heber C. Kimball, than being Church doctrine, it's a myth that the endowment ceremony has its origins from Solomon's temple or that Freemasonry passed down parts of the endowment over the centuries from Solomon's temple.

The Church makes no attempt to claim that either Freemasonry or the endowment claim their authority from being ""passed down"" in an unbroken chain from Solomon's temple.",3.0

Can he speak to man? Is he concerned with individual human needs?""

A young man not unfamiliar with praying, and responding to his youthful faith, entered a grove and, looking around and finding himself alone, kneeled, and offered up the desires of his heart to God. The grove became exceedingly light, brighter than he had ever known. Before him stood two glorious personages—defying all description. One pointed to the other and said, *""This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!""* The Son spoke to the kneeling boy. Joseph was told that all the churches were wrong—they had corrupted the doctrine, had changed the ordinances, and had lost the authority of the priesthood—and that he, unlearned but humble, was to be the instrument through whom the Almighty would reestablish his work. (See JS—H 1:15–20).

The prevalent religious teachings of the world had reduced God, in the minds of people, to a fragile spirit, spread throughout the universe, nowhere yet everywhere present—nebulous theories and uncertain doctrine as to the personality of God and the Godhead. Truth had become perverted. When the boy prophet came out of the grove, he had no doubts—he knew. He had looked upon the Father and the Son. They had visited him and instructed him. In the Prophet's own words: ""I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it"" (JS—H 1:25).

Joseph now knew God is in the form of a man. He has a voice, he speaks, he is kind, he answers prayers. His Son is like the Father—but a separate and distinct person. Joseph learned the Son is obedient to the Father and mediator between God and man.

The Lord needed a man of steel, one fearless to withstand ridicule and social and political pressures, one like unto Moses, yet greater.

In due course the boy prophet had other angelic visitations.",2.0

Let us consider some of them. Perhaps most important is the concept of the Godhead. The New Testament clearly established that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are three separate and distinct beings, yet there are many in the Christian world who do not accept this or believe in a personal God in whose image we were created. The Father and the Son actually appeared personally to Joseph Smith to establish their personality and image. When the boy came out of that grove he knew the facts—that God is in form like a man. He speaks, he is considerate and kind, he answers prayer. He is a personal God for he called Joseph by name. His Son is a like and distinct person and is the Mediator between God and man.

The occurrence in the grove was a flat contradiction that revelation had ceased, that God no longer communicated with man. Old and New Testament scriptures repeatedly affirm the need for continuous revelation. Consider the words of Amos:

""Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets"" (Amos 3:7).

Following the revelations he received, Joseph Smith taught with authority many truths recorded in the Bible which previously had not been understood.

A young boy reads the Bible, and his eyes pause on a singular passage of scripture. This is a moment that will change the world.

He is anxious to know which church can lead him to truth and salvation. He has tried almost everything else, and now he turns to the Bible and reads these words: ""If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.""1

He reflects on them over and over again. The first glimmer of light penetrates the darkness. Is this the answer, the way out of confusion and darkness? Can it be this simple? Ask God and He will answer? At length he decides he must either ask God or ever remain in darkness and confusion.

And yet as anxious as he is, he doesn't run to a quiet corner and rattle off a hurried prayer. He is only 14, but in his haste to know, he is not hasty. This is not to be just any prayer. He decides where to go and when to make the attempt. He prepares to talk to God.

And then the day comes. It is ""the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of .""2 He walks alone into the stillness of the nearby woods, beneath the trees that tower above him. He reaches the place where he previously designed to go. He kneels and offers up the desires of his heart.

Describing what happens next, he says:

""I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.

""… When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—[Joseph,] *This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!*""3

There is no dispute about what Joseph Smith accomplished, only how he did what he did and why. And there are not many options. He was either pretender or prophet. Either he did what he did alone, or he had the help of heaven. Look at the evidence, but look at all of the evidence, the entire mosaic of his life, not any single piece. Most importantly, do as young Joseph and ""ask … God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given [you].""17 This is not only how you may learn the truth about the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith; it is also the pattern to know the truth of all things.18

Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, as is Thomas S. Monson today. Through Joseph Smith, ""the keys of the kingdom of God are [again] committed unto man on the earth, and … the gospel [will] roll forth … as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands … , until it has filled the whole earth.""19

God is our Eternal Father, and Jesus is the Christ. We worship Them. Nothing compares with Their creations, the plan of salvation, and the atoning sacrifice of the Lamb of God. In this dispensation, we fulfill the plan of the Father and partake of the fruits of the Atonement only by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I bear testimony of Them—God the Eternal Father and Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. And I do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",2.0

The good spoken of Joseph Smith came slowly; the evil speaking began immediately. Joseph wrote, ""How very strange it was that an obscure boy … should be thought … of sufficient importance to attract … the most bitter persecution.""3

Now, I don't know. I can't validate or verify whether these are actual experiences or not, but I don't doubt that they could be. And what I do notice, though, is that the idea of writing off Joseph's—the reality of his experience because there are other similar ones, it's bad logic. It's bad reasoning. It's a non sequitur, it does not follow. So if your first premise is there were lots of people—and there weren't lots. It was not terribly uncommon, but it also wasn't common, it's not 9 out of 10 people who are seeing the Father and the Son in the woods. It's one out of a who knows how many, but it's a small number, but probably enough that most people have heard of somebody, somewhere, in their recent past or lifetime that had an experience in their bedroom or in their law office or in the woods with a vision of some kind or other. So Joseph Smith's gets more concrete and more—he gets more emphatic over time as he describes it about the theological content of what happened. In other words, Joseph's vision leads, by his 1838-39 narration of it, to the establishment of the Church of Jesus Christ, and he—the more he's opposed by it and the more it goes counter to his culture, the more adamantly Joseph Smith affirms it.",1.0

The Prophet Joseph Smith had his first vision at the age of fourteen while praying in a grove of trees in western New York (see First Vision). The appearance of the Lord to him, like that to Saul of Tarsus, was attended by a shining light from heaven (Acts 9:3). The Lord spoke face-to-face with Joseph and called him to service. This was the first of a series of visions Joseph Smith received, many of which were shared with other persons.

The answer was astonishing. As he prayed in the woods near his house, the Father and the Son appeared to him. Assuring him that his sins were forgiven, the Lord told him that none of the churches were right and that he should join none. Latter-day Saints call this Joseph Smith's first vision, the initial event in the restoration of the gospel. At the time, it made little impression on the people around Joseph Smith. He told a minister about the vision and was rebuffed. Believing the Bible sufficient, ministers were skeptical of direct revelation. The scorn upset Joseph, who had only tried to report his actual experience, and alienated him still further from the churches.

After three years with no further revelations, Joseph wondered if he still was in favor with God and prayed again for direction and forgiveness. The vision he received on September 21, 1823, set the course of his life for the next seven years. An angel appeared and instructed him about a sacred record of an ancient people. This angel, Moroni 2, told Joseph that he was to obtain the record, written on gold plates, and translate it. He also told him that God's covenant with ancient Israel was about to be fulfilled, that preparation for the second coming of Christ was about to commence, and that the gospel was to be preached to all nations to prepare a people for Christ's millennial reign. In a vision Joseph saw the hill near his home where the plates were buried. When he went the next day to get the plates, the angel stopped him. He was told that he must wait four years to obtain the plates and that, until then, he was to return each year for instructions. On September 22, 1827, he obtained the plates from which he translated the Book of Mormon (see Moroni, Visitations of).",3.0

It is the event that kicks off the entire story. But that's not necessarily the way Joseph Smith thought of it, and it's definitely not the way he presented it to the early Saints. He didn't. He presented to them being called of God when the angel Moroni came and called him to the work, right? God has a work for you to do, Moroni said. And Joseph being called to the work in his narrative starts with that. And that's how Mother Smith tells the story as well. So early saints didn't necessarily even know there was a First Vision. We might think that's impossible, or if there was a First Vision, he certainly would have told them, if there was a First Vision, they would have all known about it. Those are nothing but hypothetical assumptions. Zero historical evidence behind them. You can't use them to disprove the vision. All you're disproving is what you think should have happened if history happened the way you imagine it happened.

"") Yet there is no such reliable report from anyone inside or outside of Joseph's family.

Moreover, the destitute circumstances of the Smith family required long hours of ""continuous labor"" from all who were capable of work (Joseph Smith—History 1:55). As Rees has argued, the notion that ""Joseph had time to read broadly, undertake research, construct various drafts, and work out the plot, characters, settings, various points of view, and multiple rhetorical styles that constitute the five-hundred-plus page narrative of the Book of Mormon is simply incredible (in its original Latin sense of 'not worthy of belief').""17

With these circumstances in mind, we can more clearly understand why the Lord himself, through the voice of the prophet Isaiah, referred to the coming forth of the Book of Mormon as a ""marvelous work and a wonder"" (2 Nephi 27:26), and then set about to see that this prophetic description was fulfilled.",2.0

""But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.""14

Believing those prophetic words and with unwavering, childlike faith, Joseph went to a grove of trees near his home and there knelt and prayed. Later he recorded:

""I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head. …

""… When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air.""15

Looking up at these two beings, even Joseph could not have known who They were—for he had not yet witnessed and learned the true nature of God and Christ. But then, he records, ""one of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—*This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!*""16

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is distinguished from other Christian churches in several fundamental ways. Most of these differences stem from the Church's essential belief in continuing revelation. Thus, Latter-day Saints accept the Holy Bible as the word of God, and also accept the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture and as standard works.

During His earthly ministry Jesus served men and women alike: He healed both men and women and He taught both men and women.

The gospel of Jesus Christ can sanctify both men and women in the same way and by identical principles. For example, faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost are requirements for all of God's children, regardless of *gender.* The same is true of temple covenants and blessings. Our Father's work and glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of His children (see Moses 1:39). He loves us all equally, and His greatest gift, the gift of eternal life, is available to all.

Even though men and women are equal before God in their eternal opportunities, they have different, but equally significant, duties in His eternal plan. We must understand that God views all of His children with infinite wisdom and perfect fairness. Consequently, He can acknowledge and even encourage our differences while providing equal opportunity for growth and development.

Our Heavenly Father assigned different responsibilities in mortality to men and women when we lived with Him as His spirit sons and daughters. To His sons He would give the priesthood and the responsibilities of fatherhood, and to His daughters He gave the responsibilities of motherhood, each with its attendant functions.",0.0

In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life.

Like the Savior, His followers are sometimes confronted by sinful behavior, and today when they hold out for right and wrong as they understand it, they are sometimes called ""bigots"" or ""fanatics."" Many worldly values and practices pose such challenges to Latter-day Saints. Prominent among these today is the strong tide that is legalizing same-sex marriage in many states and provinces in the United States and Canada and many other countries in the world. We also live among some who don't believe in marriage at all. Some don't believe in having children. Some oppose any restrictions on pornography or dangerous drugs. Another example—familiar to most believers—is the challenge of living with a nonbelieving spouse or family member or associating with nonbelieving fellow workers.

In dedicated spaces, like temples, houses of worship, and our own homes, we should teach the truth and the commandments plainly and thoroughly as we understand them from the plan of salvation revealed in the restored gospel. Our right to do so is protected by constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and religion, as well as by the privacy that is honored even in countries without formal constitutional guarantees.",3.0

The restored Church's positions on these fundamentals frequently provoke opposition. We understand that. Our Heavenly Father's plan allows for ""opposition in all things,""18 and Satan's most strenuous opposition is directed at whatever is most important to that plan. Consequently, he seeks to oppose progress toward exaltation by distorting marriage, discouraging childbearing, or confusing gender.

Personal circumstances may change, and God's plan assures that in the long run, the faithful who keep their covenants will have the opportunity to qualify for every promised blessing.19

Particularly offensive is any conduct that harms others, especially those who because of their youth are vulnerable to seduction or coercion. The eternal laws that pertain to chastity before marriage and personal purity within marriage apply to *all* sexual behavior. However, ""marriage is not doctrinal therapy for homosexual relations"" (Oaks, p. 10). The restored gospel of Jesus Christ exalts the relationship of husband and wife, as particularly illustrated in the temple ordinances. From these doctrines, covenants, and ordinances, it is clear that any sexual relationship other than that between a legally wedded heterosexual husband and wife is sinful. The divine mandate of marriage between man and woman puts in perspective why homosexual acts are offensive to God. They repudiate the gift and the Giver of eternal life.

Recognizing that failure to keep the covenants of the gospel of Jesus Christ deprives a person of God's blessings, the Church offers counseling to help those who are troubled by homosexual thoughts or actions to learn to use their agency to live in accord with divine laws and thereby enjoy the rich blessings a benevolent Father offers to all his children, whatever their temptation or thoughts. ""That has been the message of the Jewish and Christian prophets in all ages: repent. Abandon your sins; confess them; forsake them. And become acceptable to God"" (Oaks, p. 7).

Several publications are now being circulated about the Church which defend and promote gay or lesbian conduct. They wrest the scriptures attempting to prove that these impulses are inborn, cannot be overcome, and should not be resisted; and therefore, such conduct has a morality of its own. They quote scriptures to justify perverted acts between consenting adults. That same logic would justify incest or the molesting of little children of either gender. Neither the letter nor the spirit of moral law condones any such conduct.

I hope none of our young people will be foolish enough to accept those sources as authority for what the scriptures mean. Paul, speaking on this very subject, condemned those ""who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator."" (Rom. 1:25.) In that same reference the word *covenantbreakers* is used for the only time in scripture. (See Rom. 1:31.)

Some choose to reject the scriptures out of hand and forsake their covenants. But they cannot choose to avoid the consequences. That choice is not theirs or ours or anybody's.

All of us are subject to feelings and impulses. Some are worthy and some of them are not; some of them are natural and some of them are not. We are to control them, meaning we are to direct them according to the moral law.

The legitimate union of the sexes is a law of God. The sacred covenants made by husband and wife with God protect the worthy expression of those feelings and impulses which are vital to the continuation of the race and essential to a happy family life. Illicit or perverted conduct leads without exception to disappointment, suffering, to tragedy.",3.0

My response is that we love them as sons and daughters of God. They may have certain inclinations which are powerful and which may be difficult to control. Most people have inclinations of one kind or another at various times. If they do not act upon these inclinations, then they can go forward as do all other members of the Church. If they violate the law of chastity and the moral standards of the Church, then they are subject to the discipline of the Church, just as others are.

We want to help these people, to strengthen them, to assist them with their problems and to help them with their difficulties. But we cannot stand idle if they indulge in immoral activity, if they try to uphold and defend and live in a so-called same-sex marriage situation. To permit such would be to make light of the very serious and sacred foundation of God-sanctioned marriage and its very purpose, the rearing of families.

To members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Book of Mormon forms the doctrinal foundation of the Church and speaks the word of God to all the world.

The Book of Mormon both confirms and supplements the Bible: ""Behold, this [the Book of Mormon] is written for the intent that ye may believe that [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe [the Book of Mormon] also"" (Morm. 7:9). The Bible is primarily a record of God's dealings with the forebears and descendants of Jacob or Israel in the ancient Near East. Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of God's dealings principally with another group of Israelites he brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem about 600 B.C. (see Lehi). They anticipated the birth and coming of Jesus Christ and believed in his Atonement and gospel. Their complex, lengthy records were abridged by a prophet named Mormon, inscribed on plates of gold, and buried by his son, Moroni 2, after internecine wars destroyed all of the believers in Christ in the New World except Moroni (A.D. 385).",3.0

It is because they interpret the Bible differently. If they interpreted it the same, they would be the same church. This is not a condition the Lord desires, for the Apostle Paul declared that there is ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism"" (Ephesians 4:5). To help bring this oneness about, the Lord established a divine law of witnesses. Paul taught, ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Corinthians 13:1).

The Bible is one witness of Jesus Christ; the Book of Mormon is another. Why is this second witness so crucial? The following illustration may help: How many straight lines can you draw through a single point on a piece of paper? The answer is infinite.

The Bible and the Book of Mormon are both witnesses of Jesus Christ. They teach that He is the Son of God, that He lived an exemplary life, that He atoned for all mankind, that He died upon the cross and rose again as the resurrected Lord. They teach that He is the Savior of the world.

Scriptural witnesses authenticate each other. This concept was explained long ago when a prophet wrote that the Book of Mormon was ""written for the intent that ye may believe [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe [the Book of Mormon] also.""6 Each book refers to the other. Each book stands as evidence that God lives and speaks to His children by revelation to His prophets.7

Love for the Book of Mormon expands one's love for the Bible and vice versa. Scriptures of the Restoration do not compete with the Bible; they complement the Bible. We are indebted to martyrs who gave their lives so that we could have the Bible. It establishes the everlasting nature of the gospel and of the plan of happiness. The Book of Mormon restores and underscores biblical doctrines such as tithing,8 the temple,9 the Sabbath day,10 and the priesthood.11

It gives an account of Christ's visit to the people of this continent. It corroborates and complements the Bible. It establishes the truth of the Bible. The central theme of the Book of Mormon concerns Jesus Christ and his mission. It is for the convincing of the Jews and the gentiles that Jesus is the Christ.

The Book of Mormon is a prophetic book. Its coming forth fulfills many biblical prophecies.

The Book of Mormon was given to the world with the admonition that man should test its authenticity by reading it and asking God if it is true. Before concluding the record of the Nephites, Moroni, the last surviving prophet of these people, wrote to those who would read the record in the latter days:

""When ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.""

At this time, Christ also explained the promises of God to Israel; healed the sick and disabled; blessed the children and their parents; and expressed his great love, allowing each individual to come forward and touch the wounds he had received during his crucifixion (see 3 Ne. 11-26). The record of Jesus' visit and many other passages in the Book of Mormon verify the divine sonship, ministry, Atonement, resurrection, and eternal status of the Lord Jesus Christ and show that the fulness of his gospel is the same for all people, whenever and wherever they have lived.",3.0

Would you like to have emblazoned on your soul an undeniable witness that the Savior descended beneath your sins and that there is no sin, no mortal plight outside the merciful reach of His Atonement—that for each of your struggles He has a remedy of superior healing power? Then read the Book of Mormon. It will teach you and testify to you that Christ's Atonement is infinite because it circumscribes and encompasses and transcends every finite frailty known to man. That is why the prophet Mormon declared, ""Ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ"" (Moroni 7:41).

No wonder the Book of Mormon proclaims with boldness, ""And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ"" (2 Nephi 33:10). Together with the Bible, the Book of Mormon is an indispensable witness of the doctrines of Christ and His divinity. Together with the Bible, it ""teach[es] all men that they should do good"" (2 Nephi 33:10). And together with the Bible, it brings us to ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism.""

I have read it many times. I have also read much that has been written about it. Some authors have focused upon its stories, its people, or its vignettes of history. Others have been intrigued by its language structure or its records of weapons, geography, animal life, techniques of building, or systems of weights and measures.

Interesting as these matters may be, study of the Book of Mormon is most rewarding when one focuses on its *primary* purpose—to testify of Jesus Christ. By comparison, all other issues are incidental.

When you read the Book of Mormon, concentrate on the principal figure in the book—from its first chapter to the last—the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God.3 And look for a second undergirding theme: God will keep His covenants with the remnants of the house of Israel.4

The Book of Mormon is a crucial component of that covenant.5 It is holy scripture that encompasses sacred writings from the small and large plates of Nephi, the plates of Mormon, the plates of Ether, and the plates of brass, which contained ""the five books of Moses, … a record of the Jews, … and … prophecies of the holy prophets.""6

When Mormon abridged these records, he noted that he could not write a ""hundredth part"" of their proceedings.7 Thus, *historical* aspects of the book assume *secondary* significance.",1.0

Nephi prophesied that many ""plain and precious"" truths and covenants would be taken from the gospel and the Bible after the deaths of the apostles (1 Ne. 13:26-27). Many questions that have arisen from the Bible are answered for Latter-day Saints by the Book of Mormon, such as the mode of and reasons for baptism (2 Ne. 31; 3 Ne. 11:23-26); the proper way to administer the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper (Moro. 4-5); the nature of the Resurrection (Alma 40); the effects of the Fall of Adam, and the reasons for evil and suffering in the world (2 Ne. 2). The Book of Mormon reinforces the LDS doctrine that the gospel of Jesus Christ existed before the Creation and has been revealed to prophets and believers throughout time.

Also sacred to Latter-day Saints is the Book of Mormon as a tutor in discerning the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Many Latter-day Saints, including those born into LDS families, trace their conversion to Jesus Christ and their commitment toward the Church to prayerful study of the Book of Mormon, and through it they learn to recognize the Holy Spirit. Thus, the book becomes a continuing symbol of personal revelation and of God's love for and attention to the needs of each person. It also declares that all mankind will be judged by its precepts and commandments (Mosiah 3:24; Moro. 10:27; see Judgment). It is evidence that God remembers every creature he has created (Mosiah 27:30) and every covenant he has made (1 Ne. 19:15; 3 Ne. 16:11).

For most readers, the first option is simply out of the question. There are too many lengthy quotations, especially the twelve chapters dictated back-to-back in 2 Nephi 12–24, to imagine that Joseph Smith was producing all of this biblical content from memory. The translation process was rapid enough that he wouldn't have had time to commit long sequences of biblical text to memory before each translation session.

That the Book of Mormon stands strong after nearly 200 years of critical examination should bolster the confidence of those who accept it as inspired scripture and an authentic ancient record translated by the gift and power of God. Likewise, that skeptics have yet to offer a convincing counter-explanation for the existence of the Book of Mormon is strong evidence for its authenticity.

Arguments that the Book of Mormon was derived from other nineteenth century books do not adequately explain its features—for example, its astounding narrative complexity, literary elegance, profound theology, and authentic ancient characteristics. Nor do such arguments account for the circumstances of its coming forth, including its rapid dictation, lack of revisions, and the testimonies of those who handled the plates and beheld the angel. The weight of the combined evidence affirms that the Book of Mormon is unlike any other nineteenth century work, and is an authentic ancient text.
