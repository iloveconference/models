As one of the three Book of Mormon Witnesses, Oliver Cowdery testified that an angel displayed the gold plates and that the voice of God proclaimed them correctly translated.

Having this back-up copy of the entire Book of Mormon has proved to be more than just of incidental importance. Although only about 25–30 percent of the Original Manuscript has survived,19 all but three lines of the Printer's Manuscript is intact and readily available as a phenomenal resource in studying and confirming the words originally dictated by the Prophet.20

Oliver was also called and trusted by God to be one of the Three Witnesses who saw the angel Moroni and the gold plates. His role as witness was important enough to have been prophesied centuries before by Nephi and Moroni (2 Nephi 27:12; Ether 5:4). Oliver's testimony of the Book of Mormon was of vital importance his entire life. Even while out of the Church, Oliver was insistent that his validity as a witness to the Book of Mormon and other restoration events in no way be discredited.21 In many minds, his time away from the Church strengthens the credibility of his testimony.

Once the book was printed, he was among the first to take the Book of Mormon to the world. He also served as Assistant President of the Church (1834–1837), and he, together with Martin Harris and David Whitmer, ordained the first members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1835. Oliver's personal sacrifices as a scribe, witness, missionary, and in his many other roles as one of the founding leaders of the Church deserve the utmost gratitude from all who embrace the Book of Mormon.",2

The young teacher prayed and received answers that Joseph Smith mentioned in a revelation (D&C 6:14-24). The Prophet's first history states the ""Lord appeared unto&#133;Oliver Cowdery and shewed unto him the plates in a vision and&#133;what the Lord was about to do through me, his unworthy servant. Therefore he was desirous to come and write for me to translate"" (*PJS* 1:10).

From April 7 through the end of June 1829, when they finished the translation, Joseph dictated while Oliver wrote, with ""utmost gratitude"" for the privilege (*Messenger and Advocate* 1:14). Oliver penned a letter then, expressing deep love for Christ, a lifetime theme. He later told how he and Joseph interrupted their work as they were translating the record of the Savior's post-resurrection American ministry, and how, as they prayed about baptism, they heard the ""voice of the Redeemer"" and were ministered to by John the Baptist, who gave them authority to baptize (JS-H 1:71,note).

In 1835 Oliver helped Joseph Smith correct and publish the revelations for the Doctrine and Covenants. Section 27 lists the major priesthood messengers of the restoration: John the Baptist, whom ""I have sent unto you, my servants, Joseph Smith, Jr., and Oliver Cowdery, to ordain you unto this first priesthood"" (D&C 27:8); and ""Peter, James, and John, whom I have sent unto you, by whom I have ordained you and confirmed you to be apostles and especial witnesses of my name, and bear the keys of your ministry"" (D&C 27:12).",2

From April 1829 to April 1838 Oliver Cowdery was a close associate and friend of the Prophet Joseph. He scribed most of the Book of Mormon as Joseph translated the sacred writ. On May 15, 1829 he and Joseph received the Aaronic Priesthood on the banks of the Susquehanna River from John the Baptist and the Melchizedek Priesthood from ancient apostles Peter, James, and John a few weeks later. Several of the early revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants were instructions to Oliver, who was named the second elder of the Church at the organizational meeting in Fayette, New York.",2

According to Richard L. Anderson, throughout Cowdery's life, ""He told the same simple story of the vision, whether under privation, persecution, resentment against the translator of the Book of Mormon, ridicule by non-Mormons, or knowledge of imminent death.""15

Whereas Oliver Cowdery sacrificed considerable time and energy to help with the translation process, Martin Harris fronted ""the entire cost of the publication of the Book of Mormon"" by mortgaging ""most of his property.""16 Harris also spent considerable time and energy seeking to authenticate the characters on the gold plates.17

When asked by the twelve-year-old William Glenn if he had indeed seen the plates and the angel, Harris declared, ""Gentlemen, do you see that hand? Are you sure you see it? Are your eyes playing you a trick or something? No. Well, as sure as you see my hand so sure did I see the angel and the plates.""18 With similar conviction, and often using similar analogies with concrete descriptions, Martin Harris reaffirmed his testimony over and over throughout his long life.19: 5–27."")

Moreover, his speeches and writings carry the tone of personal knowledge. Generally serving as editor or associate editor in the first publications of the Church, Oliver wrote with unusual consistency through two decades of published writings and personal letters. He insisted that a relationship with God required constant contact: ""Whenever [God] has had a people on earth, he always has revealed himself to them by the Holy Ghost, the ministering of angels, or his own voice"" (*Messenger and Advocate* 1:2). Oliver Cowdery led the Lamanite mission, the first major mission of the Church (D&C 28:8;30:5), which doubled Church membership and took the Book of Mormon to Native Americans. After the temple site was designated in Jackson County in 1831, he traveled there with copies of the revelations for their first printing. Because publishing was vital for spreading the gospel and instructing members, Oliver was called to work with William W. Phelps, an experienced editor (D&C 55:4;57:11-13). After Missouri ruffians destroyed the press, Cowdery returned to Ohio to counsel with Church leaders, who assigned him to relocate Church publications there. Because of the importance of accurate information, he and Sidney Rigdon remained in Ohio in 1834 when many faithful men marched to Missouri with Zion's Camp to assist the Saints in returning to their homes and land in Jackson County.

In 1830-1831, Oliver Cowdery served as the first Church Recorder, a calling he again resumed between 1835 and 1837 (see Historians, Church). Even in other years, he often kept the official minutes of meetings, and was often editor and contributor for the first Church newspapers. He wrote articles for the messenger and advocate that help document early LDS history. From June to October 1830, Oliver served as scribe while the Prophet completed important portions of the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible.",3

This messenger laid his hands upon their heads and said:

""Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins. …"" (D&C 13.)

Then Oliver Cowdery, a schoolteacher who learned of the plates from Joseph's parents, believed in Joseph and agreed to take dictation. From April to June 1829 they labored together. When the two friends prayed on May 15 for an understanding of baptism, a messenger who announced himself as John the Baptist appeared, conferred priesthood authority upon them, and instructed them to baptize each other (see Aaronic Priesthood: Restoration). Oliver later wrote: ""These were days never to be forgotten-to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven, awakened the utmost gratitude of this bosom"" (JS-H 1:71n).

Oliver was not the only additional witness to the revelations. When opposition began to build in Harmony, Oliver and Joseph moved in June 1829 to Fayette, New York, to the family home of Oliver's friend David Whitmer. Here again Joseph received needed support from people who believed in him. Once the translation was completed, Joseph was told that others would be allowed to see the plates, which until that time only he had viewed. The angel Moroni appeared to Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer and showed them the gold plates while a voice from heaven declared that the translation was done by the power of God and was true (see Book of Mormon Witnesses). Joseph's mother reported that Joseph came into the house after this revelation and threw himself down beside her, exclaiming that at last someone else had seen the plates. ""Now they know for themselves, that I do not go about to deceive"" (Smith, p. 139). His words suggest the pressure he felt in being the only witness of his remarkable experiences.",3

Surfacing in 1906, it portrays Oliver as confused about seeing John the Baptist. But no original exists, nor does any reference to it in Cowdery's century. Its style borrows published Cowdery phrases but rearranges his conclusions. A clumsier forgery is the ""Confession of Oliver Overstreet,"" which claims that the author was bribed to impersonate Cowdery and return to the Church. Abundant documents show that Oliver returned to Council Bluffs, Iowa, in 1848 with his wife and young daughter.

Diaries and official minutes record Oliver Cowdery's words in rejoining the Church. He sought only rebaptism and fellowship, not office. He publicly declared that he had seen and handled the Book of Mormon plates, and that he was present with Joseph Smith on the occasions when ""holy angels"" restored the two priesthoods (Anderson, *BYU Studies*, 1968, p. 278). The High Council questioned him closely about his published letter (to David Whitmer) in which Oliver claimed that he retained the keys of priesthood leadership after Joseph Smith's death. That was his opinion, Oliver said, before seeing the Nauvoo revelation giving all powers to Hyrum Smith ""that once were put upon him that was my servant Oliver Cowdery"" (D&C 124:95). ""It was that revelation which changed my views on this subject"" (Anderson, *IE*, Nov. 1968, p. 19).",1

He was ordained with the Prophet Joseph in 1829 under the hands of a heavenly messenger when the priesthood was restored to the earth. Oliver served as a scribe, writing down the translation of the Book of Mormon as it poured forth from the mouth of the Prophet Joseph. He shared with the Prophet Joseph the great visions manifested in the Kirtland Temple in 1836 and witnessed the bestowal of the keys by Moses, Elias, and Elijah.

In an early revelation the Lord warned Oliver: ""Behold, thou art blessed, and art under no condemnation. But beware of pride, lest thou shouldst enter into temptation.""6 Oliver had great intellect and enjoyed marvelous spiritual blessings. However, over time he forgot the Lord's warning, and pride entered into his heart. Brigham Young later said of this pride: ""I have seen men who belonged to this kingdom, and who really thought that if they were not associated with it, it could not progress. One man especially, whom I now think of, … was peculiarly gifted in self-reliance and general ability. He said as much to the Prophet Joseph a number of times as to say that if he left this kingdom, it could not progress any further. I speak of Oliver Cowdery. He forsook it, and it still rolled on, and still triumphed over every opposing foe, and bore off safely all those who clung to it.""7

In October 1848, 10 years after leaving the Church, Oliver Cowdery visited the Church headquarters in Iowa and humbly petitioned to be received again into the Church through baptism. Describing this memorable event, George A. Smith wrote of Oliver: ""He bore testimony in the most positive terms … and told the people if they wanted to follow the right path, to keep [in] the main channel of the stream—where the body of the Church goes, there is the authority.""8",2

Although David Whitmer considered Joseph a fallen prophet, in 1848 Cowdery said publicly and privately ""that Joseph Smith had fulfilled his mission faithfully before God until death"" (Geo. A. Smith to Orson Pratt, *MS* 11 [Oct. 20, 1848]:14), and ""that the priesthood was with this people, and the ""Twelve' were the only men that could lead the Church after the death of Joseph"" (Anderson, *IE*, Nov. 1968, p. 18). In his last known letter, Oliver accepted an assignment from the Twelve to lobby in Washington, and acknowledged the leadership of the ""good brethren of the [Salt Lake] valley"" (Gunn, p. 261).

Oliver's wife, Elizabeth Ann Whitmer Cowdery (1815-1892), had known him when he was taking dictation during the translation of the Book of Mormon, before their marriage. Said she of his lifelong commitment: ""He always without one doubt&#133;affirmed the divinity and truth of the Book of Mormon"" (Anderson, 1981, p. 63). This confidence stood the test of persecution, poverty, loss of status, failing health, and the tragic deaths of five of his six children. Dying at forty-three, Oliver was surrounded by family members who told how he reaffirmed the divinity of the Book of Mormon and the restored priesthood-and voiced total trust in Christ. Just before rejoining the Church, he penned his inner hopes to fellow witness David Whitmer: ""Let the Lord vindicate our characters, and cause our testimony to shine, and then will men be saved in his kingdom"" (Oliver Cowdery to David Whitmer, July 28, 1847, *Ensign of Liberty*, 1:92).",1

During his early tenure as editor of the paper, Oliver wrote a series of letters to William W. Phelps, another prominent Mormon figure, detailing the early history of Joseph Smith, the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, the restoration of the gospel, and the gathering of Israel. These letters, eight in total,2 were written partly to combat anti-Mormon opposition and partly to increase the faith of Church members by publishing ""a more particular or minute history of the rise and progress of the church of the Latter Day Saints [sic]; and publish, for the benefit of enquirers, and all who are disposed to learn. ""3: 27–28. In October of the same year that Oliver began his letters, the anti-Mormon author E. D. Howe published his highly influential work Mormonism Unvailed [sic] in nearby Painesville, Ohio. In it, Howe attempted to prove that the Book of Mormon was a modern fabrication based on a manuscript written by a certain Solomon Spalding and that Joseph Smith's reputation, including his honesty and moral character, was suspect.

This revelation contains commendation and subtle warnings for five of Joseph Smith's closest friends and family members. First, Oliver Cowdery is given a blessing, but also admonished to ""beware of pride"" (v. 1). Only a few months after this revelation was given, Oliver entered into contention with Joseph over some of the wording in the Articles and Covenants and then became embroiled in a dispute over who had the right to receive revelation in the Church. Oliver served as one of the most important leaders of the Church but was excommunicated in 1838. Wilford Woodruff related a conversation between Joseph and Oliver, stating, ""If the president of the Church or either of his counselors or any of the apostles or any other man feels in his heart that God cannot do without him, and that he is especially important in order to carry on the work of the Lord, he stands upon slippery ground. I heard Joseph Smith say that Oliver Cowdery, who was the second apostle in this Church, said to him, 'If I leave this Church it will fall.' Said, Joseph, 'Oliver, you try it.' Oliver tried it. He fell."" (*Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,* 1990, p. 123).

Oliver Cowdery is designated as the ""first preacher of this church"" in the last part of this revelation. Though Joseph Smith became a powerful and persuasive preacher in the latter part of his prophetic ministry, he was not confident in his public speaking skills earlier in the Restoration. He often deferred to Oliver Cowdery and later Sidney Rigdon to deliver the public discourses of the Church, men the Lord had given powerful speaking abilities.

As designated in revelation, Oliver was given the responsibility of preaching the first public sermon of any Church member. Joseph Smith's history records, ""On Sunday April 11th 1830, Oliver Cowdery preached the first public discourse, that was delivered by any <of> our number. Our meeting was held by previous appointment at the house of Mr Whitmer [Peter Whitmer Sr.], Fayette, large numbers of people attended, and the same day the following were baptized."" After the meeting Oliver baptized several people, including Hiram Page, Katherine Whitmer, Jacob Whitmer, Mary Musselman Whitmer, and Elizabeth Whitmer—Oliver's future wife—in Seneca Lake (JS History, vol. A-1, 39).

Oliver Cowdery shared with the Prophet Joseph Smith many of the profound events of the Restoration, such as their baptism under the authority of John the Baptist, the conferral of the Aaronic Priesthood, the marvelous appearances in the Kirtland Temple, and writing with his own pen ""the entire Book of Mormon (save a few pages) as it fell from the lips of the Prophet [Joseph Smith].""5 No one except the Prophet Joseph was more honored with the ministering of angels than Oliver Cowdery.",1

God still answers the prayers of the righteous and still reveals his will through a prophet to the established Church of Jesus Christ.

This is not a condition the Lord desires, for the Apostle Paul declared that there is ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism"" (Ephesians 4:5). To help bring this oneness about, the Lord established a divine law of witnesses. Paul taught, ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Corinthians 13:1).

The Book of Mormon is a crucial component of that covenant.5 It is holy scripture that encompasses sacred writings from the small and large plates of Nephi, the plates of Mormon, the plates of Ether, and the plates of brass, which contained ""the five books of Moses, … a record of the Jews, … and … prophecies of the holy prophets.""6

Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of God's dealings principally with another group of Israelites he brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem about 600 B.C. (see Lehi). They anticipated the birth and coming of Jesus Christ and believed in his Atonement and gospel. Their complex, lengthy records were abridged by a prophet named Mormon, inscribed on plates of gold, and buried by his son, Moroni 2, after internecine wars destroyed all of the believers in Christ in the New World except Moroni (A.D. 385).",3

Three mutually supportive avenues are most often followed. First, the book serves as a source of guidance and doctrine, yielding lessons and wisdom applicable to contemporary life. This approach is recommended in the writings of Nephi, who wrote that he ""did liken the scriptures unto [his people], that it might be for [their] profit and learning"" (1 Ne. 19:23). Latter-day Saints find its pages rich with ennobling narratives, clear doctrines, eternal truths, memorable sayings, and principles. Knowing the conditions of the latter days, the ancient prophets periodically address the individual reader directly. Latter-day Saints emphasize the need to read the Book of Mormon prayerfully, with faith in God, to benefit personally from its teachings and to come unto Christ.

A second approach to the Book of Mormon, adding historical dimension to the first approach, is to study the book as an ancient text. The reader who accepts the Book of Mormon as an ancient Hebrew lineage history written by prophets in the New World will find the book consistent with that description and setting. The book is a repository of ancient cultures that are as far removed from modern readers as are those of the Old and New Testaments. Continuing research has found Hebrew poetic forms, rhetorical patterns, and idioms, together with many Mesoamerican symbols, traditions, and artifacts, to be implicit in the book or consistent with it.",3

First in importance is the volume's affirmation that the Christian religion is grounded upon both the Old and New Testaments. The book affirms what recent biblical scholarship is now making plain: the continuity of the theology, ethics, and spirituality that the two Testaments proclaimed. In the Book of Mormon, Jesus is the Lord who gave the law to Moses, and the risen Christ is identical to the prophet Isaiah's messiah. He delivers exactly the same message of redemption, faith, and a new life of righteousness through the Holy Spirit that the New Testament attributes to him.

Second, the Book of Mormon reinforces the unifying vision of biblical religion, grounding it in the conviction of a common humanity that the stories of creation declared, God's promise to Abraham implied, and Jesus affirmed. Puritan millenarianism may have inspired an ethnocentric view of Anglo-Saxon destiny, but the image of the future in the Book of Mormon is a wholly opposite one. It envisions a worldwide conversion of believers and their final gathering into the kingdom of God. This begins where John Wesley's ""world parish"" leaves off.

Third, the biblical bond linking holiness to hope for salvation, both individual and social, also finds confirmation in the Book of Mormon. Certainly, Methodists had no corner on that linkage, for Baptist preachers, Charles G. Finney's Congregationalists, Alexander Campbell's Disciples of Christ, and Unitarians like William E. Channing affirmed it. Ancient Nephites heeded the word of their prophets and looked forward to the second coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of Righteousness. When he appeared to their descendants in the New World, Jesus repeated even more understandably the words of the Sermon on the Mount that he had proclaimed in the Old.",3

Several of Brigham Young's doctrinal teachings were also derived from the Book of Mormon as well.19 For example, Brigham taught, ""When God speaks to the people, he does it in a manner to suit their circumstances and capacities,"" a doctrine first explained by Nephi (2 Nephi 31:3).20. See also Doctrine and Covenants 1:24. For more on this idea, see Book of Mormon Central, ""Why Does the Lord Speak to Men 'According the Their Language' (2 Nephi 31:3),"" KnoWhy 258 (January 6, 2017)."")

Nephi prophesied that many ""plain and precious"" truths and covenants would be taken from the gospel and the Bible after the deaths of the apostles (1 Ne. 13:26-27). Many questions that have arisen from the Bible are answered for Latter-day Saints by the Book of Mormon, such as the mode of and reasons for baptism (2 Ne. 31; 3 Ne. 11:23-26); the proper way to administer the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper (Moro. 4-5); the nature of the Resurrection (Alma 40); the effects of the Fall of Adam, and the reasons for evil and suffering in the world (2 Ne. 2). The Book of Mormon reinforces the LDS doctrine that the gospel of Jesus Christ existed before the Creation and has been revealed to prophets and believers throughout time.

Also sacred to Latter-day Saints is the Book of Mormon as a tutor in discerning the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Many Latter-day Saints, including those born into LDS families, trace their conversion to Jesus Christ and their commitment toward the Church to prayerful study of the Book of Mormon, and through it they learn to recognize the Holy Spirit. Thus, the book becomes a continuing symbol of personal revelation and of God's love for and attention to the needs of each person. It also declares that all mankind will be judged by its precepts and commandments (Mosiah 3:24; Moro. 10:27; see Judgment). It is evidence that God remembers every creature he has created (Mosiah 27:30) and every covenant he has made (1 Ne. 19:15; 3 Ne. 16:11).

The Book of Mormon, however, eliminates all doubt on that subject: ""And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptized in his name, … or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God"" (2 Nephi 9:23).

There exist various modes of baptisms in the world today even though the Bible tells us the manner in which the Savior, our great Exemplar, was baptized: ""[He] went up straightway out of the water"" (Matthew 3:16). Could He have come up out of the water unless He first went down into the water?

Neither the Bible nor the Book of Mormon in and of themselves is sufficient. Both are necessary for us to teach and learn about the full and complete doctrine of Christ.

Mormon 7:8–9 — The Record That Shall Come Forth from the Jews Unto the Gentiles In referring to the gospel of Jesus Christ, Mormon then prophesied of the coming of the Bible through the Jews to the Gentiles, and thence to the descendants of the Nephites and Lamanites. He stated that if his audience believed his records, they ""will believe that [namely, the Bible]."" He knew that this would be one of the great missions of the Book of Mormon—to help establish the truth of the Bible. Doctrine and Covenants 20:11 similarly says that one of the main missions of the Book of Mormon is ""proving to the world that the holy scriptures [including the Bible] are true.""

Latter-day Saints, however, often reverse this logic, using the Bible to prove that Joseph Smith was a prophet and to bolster other parts of the restored gospel, which it indeed does. But, if the Book of Mormon is intended, according to Mormon, to prove that the Bible is true, the logic should run primarily in that direction. By knowing that the Book of Mormon is good and true, one can then know even better and more surely that the Bible is true. And in a day such as ours, when many people have lost faith in the credibility of the Bible, the strength of the Book of Mormon should only be welcomed as an enhancing ally. Increasingly today, the Book of Mormon may be the first introduction that many people coming from a non-Judeo-Christian background will have to the Bible in general and the Gospel of Jesus Christ in particular.

Reciprocally, as Mormon also expects, belief in the Bible can also enhance belief in the Book of Mormon. How can we help fulfill this two-way interactivity? It takes conscious attention and effort to realize and show how extensively and how meaningfully these two ""sticks"" of scripture do and should, indeed, become one in our hands, as Ezekiel 37 prophesies that they are intended to become.",1

One of the ultimate messages of the Book of Mormon, and indeed of the Old Testament and all human history, is that mankind cannot reach perfection on its own. There is another message which comes through loud and clear from its pages. It is the often unpopular and seemingly harsh injunction—""Repent or perish."" When the Book of Mormon people listened to this prophetic message, they flourished. When they forgot the message, they perished.

In Galatians Paul said, ""The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ."" (Gal. 3:24.)

And if you understand the Book of Mormon, you can use that to unlock greater, deeper insights and meaning in the Bible. And it's an iterative process.

So there are ways to see how the Book of Mormon, these plates being buried in Hill Cumorah, could literally fulfill this, but Isaiah, his seership writing is so big and so broad that it can be applied in myriad ways.

For us, as Latter-day Saints, we love this Book of Mormon application to that prophecy, that those scriptures were laid low, and now they're speaking out of the ground, out of the dust. And when we hear the words of the book, they have a familiar spirit. There's a connection there to what we already know from the Bible. It's beautiful imagery.",1

He then asked a question that all missionary-minded members are anxious to hear: ""Why do we need additional witnesses of Jesus Christ other than the Bible?"" Rather than responding quickly, we asked him why he thought this might be important. His answer seemed even more inspired than his question. He suggested that since there appeared to be so many variations of the Bible and its teachings, we needed some kind of clarifying voice, something that would help us understand the Bible better. His observation opened the door for us to share our feelings and testimonies regarding both the Bible and the Book of Mormon.

We began by expressing our devotion and deep conviction to the doctrines and teachings of the Bible, especially the New Testament. Being able to read many of the Savior's words as He taught the gospel during His earthly ministry strengthens us, helps us come to know Him, and teaches us that we can become more like Him. We then declared that, like the Bible, the Book of Mormon is additional evidence that God loves all of His children and has provided a way for us to return and live with Him once again.

While the Bible bears record of teachings the Lord gave to His prophets who lived in the Old World, the Book of Mormon contains teachings the Lord gave to His prophets who lived in the American hemisphere. This record covers a period of about a thousand years, from approximately 600 b.c. to a.d. 400 (although there is reference to other migrations and peoples preceding that time). The Book of Mormon bears record of the personal ministry of Jesus Christ, as the resurrected Lord, to inhabitants of ancient America. Prophets recorded His teachings among them. Hence, the Book of Mormon is ""Another Testament of Jesus Christ"" (Book of Mormon Title Page). It came in fulfillment of biblical prophecy: ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Cor. 13:1). It came as a heavenly gift to the entire human family. Originally inscribed on metallic plates and written in a modified Egyptian language, that record was preserved for many centuries, then made available for translation into the English language. That translation was done by the Prophet Joseph Smith through the gift and power of God. Subsequently, the book has been translated into many other languages. Since its first publication in 1830, millions of copies of the Book of Mormon have been printed. In the year 1992 alone, nearly five million copies were distributed.

We have observed that sincere study of the Book of Mormon transforms the spirit and engenders a testimony of Jesus Christ that heals the spiritual hearts of men and women throughout the world. The more widely it is read and understood, the greater is its influence for good. We find that as the Book of Mormon spreads to the four corners of the globe, men and women exhibit greater devotion and become promulgators of peace within their own families and society.",1

These words provide insight and inspiration to all who sincerely seek to know and understand the truth about Jesus Christ. The scriptures are rich in history, doctrine, stories, sermons, and testimonies, all of which ultimately focus on the eternal Christ and His physical and spiritual mission to Heavenly Father's children.

Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe that ""all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable"" (2 Timothy 3:16). We love the Bible and other scriptures. That may be surprising to some who may not be aware of our belief in the Bible as the revealed word of God. It is one of the pillars of our faith, a powerful witness of the Savior and of Christ's ongoing influence in the lives of those who worship and follow Him. The more we read and study the Bible and its teachings, the more clearly we see the doctrinal underpinnings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. We tend to love the scriptures that we spend time with. We may need to balance our study in order to love and understand all scripture.

You young people especially, do not discount or devalue the Holy Bible. It is the sacred, holy record of the Lord's life. The Bible contains hundreds of pages more than all of our other scripture combined. It is the bedrock of all Christianity. We do not criticize or belittle anyone's beliefs. Our great responsibility as Christians is to share all that God has revealed with all of His sons and daughters.

Those who join this Church do not give up their faith in the Bible—they strengthen it. The Book of Mormon does not dilute nor diminish nor de-emphasize the Bible. On the contrary, it expands, extends, and exalts it. The Book of Mormon testifies of the Bible, and both testify of Christ.",2

Moroni states in the book of Ether that the Jaredites gathered for battle near ""the hill Ramah,"" the same hill where his father, Mormon, hid up ""the records unto the Lord, which were sacred"" (Ether 15:11). It was near the first landing site of the people of Mulek (Alma 22:30), just north of the land Bountiful and a narrow neck of land (Alma 22:32).

The more common reference to Cumorah among Latter-day Saints is to the hill near present-day Palmyra and Manchester, New York, where the plates from which the Prophet Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon were found. During the night of September 21, 1823, Moroni 2 appeared to Joseph Smith as an angel sent from God to show him where these plates were deposited (JS-H 1:29-47).

In 1928 the Church purchased the western New York hill and in 1935 erected a monument recognizing the visit of the angel Moroni (see Angel Moroni Statue). A visitors center was later built at the base of the hill. Each summer since 1937, the Church has staged the Cumorah Pageant at this site. Entitled *America's Witness for Christ,* it depicts important events from Book of Mormon history. This annual pageant has reinforced the common assumption that Moroni buried the plates of Mormon in the same hill where his father had buried the other plates, thus equating this New York hill with the Book of Mormon Cumorah. Because the New York site does not readily fit the Book of Mormon description of Book of Mormon geography, some Latter-day Saints have looked for other possible explanations and locations, including Mesoamerica. Although some have identified possible sites that may seem to fit better (Palmer), there are no conclusive connections between the Book of Mormon text and any specific site that has been suggested.",3

Much more important than precisely where the Book of Mormon hill Cumorah may be located is what transpired at a ""hill of considerable size"" near the town of Manchester, New York in the early morning hours of September 22, 1827 (Joseph Smith–––History 1:51–59).

Sensing the impending destruction of his people, Mormon records that he concealed the plates of Nephi 1 and all the other records entrusted to him in a hill called Cumorah to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Lamanites (see Book of Mormon Plates and Records). He delivered his own abridgment of these records, called the plates of Mormon, and the small plates of Nephi, which he placed with them, to his son Moroni 2 (W of M 1:5; Morm. 6:6), who continued writing on them before burying them in an unmentioned site more than thirty-six years later (Moro. 10:1-2).

The Book of Mormon mentions a number of separate records that would have been part of Mormon's final record repository in the hill Cumorah. Though the contents of these can be known to us only to the extent that they are summarized or mentioned in the Book of Mormon, Latter-day Saints expect them someday to become available. Alma 2 prophesied to his son Helaman that the brass plates of Laban (the Nephites' version of the Old Testament) would be ""kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord until they should go forth unto every nation"" (Alma 37:4; cf. 1 Ne. 5:17-19).

This is in direct contradiction to what Joseph Smith and other prophets have taught.

It is not, in fact, in direct contradiction to anything Joseph Smith taught. Joseph never made reference to the hill in New York as Cumorah. No identification of the drumlin in New York as Cumorah can be found in the Doctrine and Covenants or any canonized revelation.

Even a cursory reading of the Book of Mormon makes it clear that the Hill Cumorah isn't the hill in upstate New York where Joseph got the plates. In Mormon 6:6, Mormon states that he ""hid up in the hill Cumorah all the records which had been entrusted to me by the hand of the Lord, save it were these few plates which I gave unto my son Moroni."" [Emphasis added.] So the plates Moroni had after the massive bloody battle at Cumorah were specifically not plates that had been buried there. Moroni then spends decades wandering with these plates, presumably getting as far away from Cumorah as possible, and then buries them up for Joseph to find in an area far removed the Cumoran carnage.
It is correct to say that many Church leaders have equated the New York Hill with Cumorah, but the Church's official position on Book of Mormon geography has always been one of neutrality, and they have scrupulously avoided officially jumping in to the long-running debate over where the Book of Mormon took place.",1

For example, an entry in Joseph Smith's journal under the date November 20, 1835 indicates the Prophet ""spent the day in translating"" the Egyptian records.2 In an unpublished editorial that was apparently meant to be printed in the March 1, 1842 issue of the *Times and Seasons* (the issue that saw the publication of the first installment of the Book of Abraham), Joseph Smith signaled his desire to ""continue to translate and publish [the text] as fast as possible [until] the whole is completed.""3 What was published with the Book of Abraham was a preface announcing it as ""A TRANSLATION Of some ancient Records that have fallen into our hands . . . purporting to be the writings of Abraham.""4

But while Joseph Smith and others used the word ""translation"" to describe the production of the Book of Abraham, the *means* or *methods* Joseph used to translate ancient scripture were unique. Rather than utilizing dictionaries, grammar books, and lexicons, Joseph translated scripture through revelation. This can be seen in the other efforts Joseph Smith undertook throughout his prophetic ministry to produce other books of scripture.5",3

After his disaffection from the Church in 1837, Parrish reported that in his capacity as Joseph's scribe he ""penned down the translation of the Egyptian Hieroglyphicks as [Joseph] claimed to receive it by direct inspiration from Heaven.""20 Parrish's statement, like Whitmer's, emphasizes that the method of Joseph's ""translation of the Egyptian Hieroglyphicks"" was revelatory, not academic, but that the Prophet was still performing a translation of an ancient language.

""One advantage is that in Doctrine and Covenants section 7, Joseph Smith translated an ancient papyrus that he never had in his possession; hence, there is a precedent for Joseph Smith translating a papyrus that was not in his possession, and so there is no reason to suppose that he had to have the papyrus of the Book of Abraham in his possession either.""16 At the same time, however, the main drawback to this theory is that Joseph Smith himself believed that he possessed a physical record of Abraham.17

""Given our current state of knowledge,"" concludes one Latter-day Saint scholar, ""the theory that Joseph Smith translated the Book of Abraham from papyri that we no longer have accounts for the most evidence with the fewest problems. Even so, for none of the theories is the evidence as neat or as compelling as one might wish.""18 It could even be argued that some of these (and other) theories might be combined to form new paradigms. ""As scholars continue to find, research, and analyze the evidence that bears on this subject, future studies will undoubtedly illuminate other theories that have not yet been conceived.""19

Since The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has not taken an official stance on how the translation of the Book of Abraham was accomplished other than by revelation, and since the evidence is not as clear or as complete as we might like, it would perhaps be wiser for readers to worry less about the method of the translation and more about the results.",3

As an essay published by the Church recently articulated,

> Joseph's study of the papyri may have led to a revelation about key events and teachings in the life of Abraham, much as he had earlier received a revelation about the life of Moses while studying the Bible. This view assumes a broader definition of the words translator and translation. According to this view, Joseph's translation was not a literal rendering of the papyri as a conventional translation would be. Rather, the physical artifacts provided an occasion for meditation, reflection, and revelation. They catalyzed a process whereby God gave to Joseph Smith a revelation about the life of Abraham, even if that revelation did not directly correlate to the characters on the papyri.14

And so we're so far only talking about the text of the Book of Abraham, but it seems like there's a lot that we don't know, and there's still plenty of room to say that Joseph Smith had these materials, translated either from these materials or was inspired by these materials, that the Book of Abraham comes from God.

Scott Woodward:

Yeah, and that's consistent with his other translation projects, right? Like the Book of Mormon, which was actually written in Reformed Egyptian. By the time Joseph was done translating the Book of Mormon, he still couldn't read Reformed Egyptian. At the end of the day, it came by the gift and power of God. It came by revelation. He got revelation through the use of seer stones, and there was little, if any, actually looking at the text of the Book of Mormon plates, right? He's not running his finger along the hieroglyphs, as far as any eyewitnesses say. He's actually just getting revelation through the instruments that were prepared for that purpose, as he focuses his faith on the plates themselves, right, and asks for revelation to come. So that's the Book of Mormon.

Casey Paul Griffiths:

Yeah. And the same with the Bible. When he translates the Bible, he's not claiming that he has the original manuscripts or that he can see them in vision. He is saying, by the means of the Holy Spirit, I am translating, and that's the word he uses, translating. So all this is consistent. All this is totally consistent.

Scott Woodward:

The parchment of John that we just talked about in D&C 7, again, Joseph never claimed to be able to read Greek.

Belief that he was a real person is shared by others, but the LDS approach is unique: Revelations received by the Prophet Joseph Smith confirm the basic historicity of Genesis and add information echoed in ancient sources, many of which have emerged since his day.

The book of Abraham as restored by Joseph Smith autobiographically recounts Abraham's early life, explaining why he was singled out as the pivotal recipient of divine promises for the blessing of mankind. Not only had he been foreordained in premortal life (Abr. 3:23; cf. *Apocalypse of Abraham* 22:1-5), but as a young man in Ur he opposed idolatry and human sacrifice, ironically turning him into an intended victim (Abr. 1:5-20; cf. *Genesis Rabbah* 38:13). The irony increases when God's last-minute rescue of Abraham foreshadowed what would transpire at Abraham's offering of Isaac.

After marrying Sarah and learning of his lineal right to the patriarchal order of the priesthood as disclosed in the ""records of the fathers"" (Abr. 1:2-4, 26, 31;2:2; *Jubilees* 12:27; cf. D&C 107:40-57), Abraham traveled to Haran, where he apparently received his ordination (Abr. 2:9-11; *WJS*, pp. 245, 303). He also saw the Lord, who gave him remarkable promises: Abraham would be blessed above measure; his posterity would carry the gospel to all nations; and all who received it would bear his name, be accounted his posterity, and bless him as their father (Abr. 2:6-11; cf. Gen. 12:1-3).",3

We look at where in Egypt the papyri from which the Book of Abraham was purportedly translated came from, and how Joseph Smith came to possess both this papyri and a couple pair of mummies. We look at the three theories of what source material Joseph Smith translated from and how he did it, and we trace what we know of what happened to the papyri after Joseph's death, how many fragments have survived to this day, and what modern Egyptologists think about those surviving fragments, which is the source of the two biggest controversies about the Book of Abraham.

For example, the *Testament of Abraham* -likely first written in Greek-almost certainly derives from Egypt. Substituting a biblical figure such as Abraham in Egyptian hieroglyphic scenes is a Jewish technique known from the Hellenistic period (Grobel, pp. 373-82). Thus, it is not surprising that Egyptian texts are somehow linked to the appearance of the Book of Abraham.

According to some Egyptologists, the writings of Abraham acquired by Joseph Smith are to be dated to the early Christian era. Such dating is not without precedent. The *Testament of Abraham*, edited initially by M. R. James in 1892, was described by him as ""a second century Jewish-Christian writing composed in Egypt"" (Nibley, pp. 20-21).",1

Several views have been advanced concerning the process whereby the Prophet Joseph Smith produced the work. Although he and his associates began an ""Egyptian Alphabet and Grammar"" while they studied the papyri, the purpose of that work is obscure. It was not completed, explained, or published by Joseph Smith or any of his successors. However, it is certain that he began working in Kirtland, Ohio, on the relevant Egyptian papyri soon after purchasing them from Michael H. Chandler in 1835.

Probably no one in the United States in 1835 could interpret Egyptian hieroglyphics through ordinary translation techniques. When he translated the gold plates of the Book of Mormon from the ""reformed Egyptian"" text (1827-1829), the Prophet stated that he did it ""by the gift and power of God."" Likewise, it was principally divine inspiration rather than his knowledge of languages that produced the English text of the book of Abraham. His precise methodology remains unknown.",1

You certainly don't need a theory of where it came from, nor do you need to agree with any of the theories listed above.

Personally, I believe it was sort of a combination of the last two theories, as we know for a fact that the missing scrolls that everyone at the time said was the source of the Book of Abraham ended up burning in the Chicago fire (the intake papers at the museum confirm the scrolls, **one of which had a second text on it after Facsimile 3** which easily could have been the source of the Book of Abraham), and because there are accounts from Lucy Mack Smith that Joseph could translate the text from the missing portions where there were holes in the papyri. Obviously, any time Joseph is translating ancient documents it's done by direct revelation, but when the source material is missing, that's when we get the catalytic revelations mentioned above.

Right? Revelation. Here's John Whitmer, early church historian. He records in July 1835 that Joseph Smith, ""by the revelation of Jesus Christ could translate these records, which gave an account of our forefathers, even Abraham."" So John Whitmer is at least recording what Joseph Smith was claiming, right? And this is not surprising. This is Joseph Smith's M. O. It's by revelation. And you quoted Warren Parrish earlier, that he says that Joseph, ""claimed to receive it by direct inspiration of heaven."" He's talking very much as an antagonist, but the story is consistent. Joseph claimed to translate the Book of Abraham the same way he ever claimed to translate anything, which was by revelation, not by learning the underlying source language, right? He's not learning Egyptian, Reformed Egyptian, Greek, anything like that. It's just by the gift and power of God. That's how Joseph always claimed to translate.

God taught Abraham in the ""language"" of his day— from within a framework of his cultural perceptions and worldview. He did the same thing to those who recorded Genesis—God didn't give them advanced scientific ideas, but rather shared information about who they are in relationship to each other, the world, and most importantly to God. This information was shared in a vessel of a worldview and cosmology that they already understood (even though it doesn't square with modern science and 21st century cosmology).

* 27) The Philosophy of the Future State (printed in 1829 and owned by Joseph Smith) makes claims that are likewise made in the Book of Abraham.

Answer: First, we don't know when Joseph acquired the book. We know that in 1844 he donated his copy to the Nauvoo Library. Owning it in 1844 doesn't mean he read it in 1830— that's an assumption. Even if he had read it, however, many of the topics in the book were already being promoted as common Protestant ideas, and a number of the things in the book directly contradict some of the teachings in the Book of Abraham.

* 28) The Church doesn't know how to respond to the Book of Abraham problems and now concedes that the Book of Abraham text doesn't match Egyptian translations.
Answer: The Lord doesn't typically tell us how miracles are performed. Do we know how the Red Sea was parted, how water was turned to wine, how God revealed the 10 commandments, or how Jesus rose from the dead?",2

* The Book of Abraham translation was inspired by/made up during/kicked off by the Kirtland Egyptian Papers (KEP) and the Grammar and Alphabet of the Egyptian Language (GAEL) document in particular. This is the favorite theory of those on the Mormon subreddit, and their preferred Book of Abraham scholars Robert Ritner and Brian Hauglid.
* The Book of Abraham was a catalytic revelation spurred by looking at the papyri and it wasn't actually contained on any of the papyrus Joseph had. This is certainly possible, as we know Joseph had other catalytic revelations in the past, such as D&C 7 or the Book of Moses. He did not have the original source material for either of those books, but he received the revelation containing them nonetheless. The JST Matthew translation would also probably fit into this category, even though Joseph obviously had the Bible as a source.
* The Book of Abraham was contained on the longer rolls of parchment that we know existed in 1835-1842, but that we do not have today, and Joseph translated the text from that long roll.

Truly we can say, the Lord is beginning to reveal the abundance of peace and truth"" (*HC* 2:236). After delays, Joseph Smith appointed two men on November 2, 1837, to raise funds to help translate and print the book of Abraham. But because of further difficulties, he was unable to begin publishing for four more years. The book of Abraham was first printed in three issues of the *Times and Seasons* on March 1, March 15, and May 16, 1842. These installments contained the entire current book of Abraham, including the three facsimiles. In February 1843, Joseph Smith promised that more of the book of Abraham would be published. However, continued harassment by enemies kept the Prophet from ever publishing more of the record. It did receive considerable notoriety when several prominent eastern newspapers in the United States reprinted Facsimile 1 and part of the text from the *Times and Seasons* publication.

In 1851 the writings of Abraham were published in England as a part of the Pearl of Great Price, a small compilation by Franklin D. Richards containing some of Joseph Smith's translations and revelations. It was this compilation that was canonized in 1880, in Salt Lake City, thereby placing it alongside three other sacred collections or standard works: the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the Doctrine and Covenants.",1

In reference to the Book of Mormon, he said that it was """"not expedient"""" for him to relate all the particulars of its coming forth (*HC* 1:220; see Book of Mormon Translation By Joseph Smith). He did, in several instances, refer to the book of Abraham as a translation (*HC* 4:543, 548); and when the installments of the book of Abraham were published in the *Millennial Star*, it was described as being """"translated by Joseph Smith"""" (July 1842, p. 34). Both Wilford Woodruff (in his journal) and Parley P. Pratt (in the July 1842 *Millennial Star* ) maintained that the translation was done by means of the Urim and Thummim, although Joseph Smith himself does not mention using this instrument anywhere in the translation.

One must consider, however, what Joseph Smith meant by translation. Section 7 of the Doctrine and Covenants offers one standard measure. Here, the Prophet, using the Urim and Thummim, translated a """"record made on parchment by John the Revelator."""" Although it is not known whether Joseph Smith actually had this document, he provided a translation of it. Since it is not known just how Joseph Smith translated, it is reasonable to postulate that, when studying the Egyptian papyri purchased from Michael Chandler, Joseph Smith sought revelation from the Lord concerning them and received in that process the book of Abraham. He might then have searched through the papyri in his possession to find illustrations similar to those he had learned by revelation. This forms one possible explanation of how drawings done about the first century A.D. were used to illustrate the book of Abraham.",0

For example, in chapter 12 of the *Testament of Abraham* there is a description of the judgment of the dead that matches in minute detail the scene depicted in Facsimile 3 of the book of Abraham and, incidentally, chapter 125 of the Egyptian *Book of the Dead*. In fact, parallels to almost every verse in the book of Abraham can be found in the pseudepigraphical writings about Abraham.

In summary, the numerous similarities that the book of Abraham and associated Latter-day Saint doctrines share with both Egyptian religious texts and recently discovered pseudepigraphical writings may confirm further the authenticity of the Joseph Smith Translation known as the book of Abraham. A major question about its authenticity continues to revolve around whether Joseph Smith translated the work from the papyrus fragments the Church now has in its possession or whether he used the Urim and Thummim to receive the text of the book of Abraham by revelation, as is the case with the translation of the scroll of John the Revelator, found in Doctrine and Covenants section 7,or the Book of Moses, which is excerpted from the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible and is also found in the Pearl of Great Price. From these examples, it is evident that for Joseph Smith it was not necessary to possess an original text in order to have its translation revealed to him. In his function as prophet, seer, and revelator, many channels were open to him to receive information by divine inspiration.

Replica of the Urim and Thummim by Brian Westover, photo by Daniel Smith. Image via Book of Mormon Central.Whatever his precise method of translation, which Joseph specified no more than being ""by the gift and power of God,"" more important is what the Prophet produced. As Hugh Nibley recognized, ""[T]he Prophet has saved us the trouble of faulting his method by announcing in no uncertain terms that it is a method unique to himself depending entirely on divine revelation. That places the whole thing beyond the reach of direct examination and criticism but leaves wide open the really effective means of testing any method, which is by the results it produces.""28 The results of Joseph Smith's inspired translations are books of scripture that would have been beyond the Prophet's natural ability to produce on his own. This is true for the Book of Abraham, which evinces numerous signs of having been derived from the ancient world as it claims and not from Joseph Smith's fertile imagination or nineteenth-century environment.29

A fuller grasp of this fascinating and important subject therefore includes appreciating how Joseph Smith and other early Latter-day Saints used words such as ""translation"" in ways that are similar but also in some ways very different than how they are typically used today.30",1

He said, ""I penned down the translation of the Egyptian hieroglyphics as Joseph claimed to receive it by direct inspiration from heaven."" So he's saying that when he worked with Joseph Smith, said he was receiving the text of the Book of Abraham by direct inspiration.

Scott Woodward:

Yeah, so there's this line also in the Gospel Topics essay, which is describing this third theory of translation, which says, ""Alternatively, Joseph's study of the papyri may have led to a revelation about key events and teachings in the life of Abraham, much as he had earlier received a revelation about the life of Moses while studying the Bible. So we have these eyewitnesses saying he's looking at the scrolls, right? He's studying the scrolls. And then he's also getting revelation about Abraham. Now, what exactly the connection is between what's actually written on the scrolls and the revelation he's receiving, that's a different story.",1

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints accommodates either of these views and does not take an official position on the translation of the book of Abraham other than to say it was accomplished by divine inspiration (something Joseph Smith and others who assisted him in the translation of the text repeatedly affirmed).
 The book of Abraham is narrated in an autobiographical voice that is consonant in tone and style with Joseph Smith's other scriptural productions. Like the Book of Mormon, it purports to be a historical narrative, although it does contain poetic and literary elements such as parallelism and a brief soliloquy (Abraham 2:12–13). The text recounts scenes from the history of the eponymous biblical patriarch and offers a personalized glimpse into Abraham's life as he flees his idolatrous kinsfolk in his homeland of Ur of the Chaldees, enters a covenant with God, and beholds a spectacular vision of the cosmos and Creation.",0

It gives an account of Christ's visit to the people of this continent. It corroborates and complements the Bible. It establishes the truth of the Bible. The central theme of the Book of Mormon concerns Jesus Christ and his mission. It is for the convincing of the Jews and the gentiles that Jesus is the Christ.

The Book of Mormon is a prophetic book. Its coming forth fulfills many biblical prophecies.

The Book of Mormon was given to the world with the admonition that man should test its authenticity by reading it and asking God if it is true. Before concluding the record of the Nephites, Moroni, the last surviving prophet of these people, wrote to those who would read the record in the latter days:

""When ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.""

In September of 1823, he was again visited by a heavenly messenger who told him his name was Moroni and that God had a work for Joseph to do.

The angel told him of a book, written upon gold plates, that was deposited in a nearby hill. The plates contained an account of the former inhabitants of the American continent, and also the fulness of the everlasting gospel as delivered by the Savior to those ancient people. Joseph was instructed to visit the spot where the plates were deposited each year for four years. This he did, and on each occasion he was met and instructed by the angel Moroni until finally he was ready to receive and translate the plates.

If any of you are not already familiar with the story of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, I invite you to avail yourselves of the opportunity to do so. Read the book itself, which contains this promise in the last chapter:

""And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things"" (Moro. 10:4–5).

It is this power which bears witness to hundreds of thousands of converts each year that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that the Book of Mormon is true, that it is a companion book to the Bible and a new and further witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ and a record of his dealings with the early inhabitants of America.",3

Book of Mormon Translations

After the Prophet Joseph Smith's original translation of the Book of Mormon from the gold plates into English in 1829 and the return of those plates to the angel Moroni, no translations from English into other languages appeared until the 1850s. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Church produced translations of the Book of Mormon irregularly, often in groups of languages, and at widely separated intervals. However, in the 1970s and later, translations from the English text of the Book of Mormon became systematic and frequent.

Making the Book of Mormon and other Standard Works available in many languages is foreshadowed by the divine injunction ""that every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language"" (D&C 90:11). As missions were opened on the continent of Europe in 1850 and 1851, Church leaders in many of the newly opened missions mounted simultaneous translation efforts. The Danish edition (1851), produced by Erastus Snow for the Scandinavian Mission from a Danish translation by Peter Olsen Hansen, was the first printed (see SCANDINAVIA, THE CHURCH IN). At the same time, John TAYLOR supervised translations into French by Curtis E. Bolton and German by George P. Dykes, while Lorenzo SNOW was working on the Italian edition and John Davis on a Welsh one. All of these appeared in 1852, and culminated with George Q. Cannon's translation of the Book of Mormon into Hawaiian in 1855. No further translations we republished for twenty years.",1

In several chapters, for good and useful reasons, this meant that the language would follow the King James idiom of the day (*see CWHN* 8:212-16; Welch, 1990, pp. 134-63). It also assured that the manuscript would contain human misspellings and grammatical oddities, implying that if it had been translated in another decade its phraseology and vocabulary might have been slightly different.

At the same time, circumstantial evidence in the English text suggests that the translation was quite precise. For example, the independent and identical translations of 1 Nephi 1:8 andof Alma 36:22(precisely quoting twenty-one of Lehi's words in 1 Nephi 1:8) typify the internal accuracy manifested in this long and complex record. Moreover, several formulaic terms, Hebraisms, stylistic indications of multiple authorship, varieties of parallelism and extended chiasmus (see Book of Mormon Authorship; Book of Mormon Literature), as well as certain Semitic proper names and some textual variants, not at all evident from the King James Bible, corroborate the claim that the translation was faithful to a consistent underlying text.",1

The King James Version of the Bible, for example, was produced by 50 English scholars who accomplished their work in seven years, translating at the rate of *one* page per day.39 Expert translators today do well if they can also translate scripture at the rate of one page per day.

In contrast, Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon at the rate of about *10* pages per day, completing the task in about 85 days (Many of us feel good if we can read the book in that time.)

Such a pace is even more remarkable considering the circumstances under which the Prophet labored. In that same period, while enduring constant distractions and incessant hostility, Joseph Smith moved more than 100 miles from Harmony, Pennsylvania, to Fayette, New York.41 He applied for a copyright.42 He received revelations comprising 12 sections of the Doctrine and Covenants.43 Heavenly beings restored the holy priesthood. Yet he completed the translation in less than three months.

The First Presidency provided opportunity for the Twelve Apostles to see portions of the original manuscript and the printer's manuscript of the Book of Mormon. Words cannot describe the deep emotions we felt as we examined these precious documents and observed that marks of editing were remarkably rare.",3

I was overwhelmed at the purity of the transcription, which had only a very few insignificant corrections, such as a misspelled word. Joseph's original manuscript is so perfect it could only have come from one source—divine revelation.

On Joseph's shoulders rested not only the translation of the Book of Mormon but also the restoration and reestablishment of the Church of Jesus Christ. Even as Joseph translated, he received many revelations and visitations from heavenly messengers who gave him additional important assignments, such as the restoration of the priesthood and the revelation on baptism (see JS—H 1:68–75). Joseph's many responsibilities often interrupted the translation process, sometimes for several months. Yet, once Joseph was free to dedicate his entire effort to translation, the work surged forward and he translated eight to ten pages a day, completing the preponderance of the Book of Mormon translation in approximately sixty-three working days (see John W. Welch and Tim Rathbone, ""The Translation of the Book of Mormon: Basic Historical Information,"" Provo, Utah: F.A.R.M.S., 1986, p. 14).",1

Other things were done. The Book of Mormon was given a subtitle—the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.

The Book of Mormon, however, was produced in a very different manner. Various witnesses claimed that its 269,510 words,1 originally printed onto 588 pages,2 were revealed to Joseph Smith through divinely prepared translation instruments by the gift and power of God.3 According to those present, the young 23-year-old prophet dictated the words of the Book of Mormon day after day, for hours on end, in the presence of multiple scribes and witnesses, without any outlines, preliminary drafts, working notes, reference materials, or substantive revisions.4

Creating a final draft of any lengthy document under these circumstances would be remarkable. Yet the production of the Book of Mormon is truly astounding when one takes into account the rapid pace of its translation. Based on a variety of source documents, it can now be firmly established that the English text of the Book of Mormon (as it was published in 1830) was essentially translated between April 7 and June 30, 1829.

Joseph Smith, however, was directed to the plates by an angel. That outcome by itself was a miracle.

The translation process of the Book of Mormon was also a miracle. This sacred ancient record was not ""translated"" in the traditional way that scholars would translate ancient texts by learning an ancient language. We ought to look at the process more like a ""revelation"" with the aid of physical instruments provided by the Lord, as opposed to a ""translation"" by one with knowledge of languages. Joseph Smith declared that through God's power he ""translated the Book of Mormon from [hieroglyphs], the knowledge of which was lost to the world, in which wonderful event [he] stood alone, an unlearned youth, to combat the worldly wisdom and multiplied ignorance of eighteen centuries, with a new revelation.""11 The Lord's help in the translation of the plates—or revelation, so to speak—is also evident when considering the miraculously short time Joseph Smith took to translate them.12

Joseph's scribes testified of the power of God that was manifested while working on the translation of the Book of Mormon. Oliver Cowdery once said: ""These were days never to be forgotten—to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven, awakened the utmost gratitude of this bosom!

Some accounts emphasize the divine factor. Years later, David Whitmer indicated that words would appear to Joseph on something resembling a piece of parchment and that he would read the words off to his scribe (*An Address to All Believers in Christ*, 1887, p. 12). Other accounts indicate that human effort was also involved. When Oliver Cowdery attempted to translate in April 1829, he was told by the Lord: ""You must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right"" (D&C 9:8). According to David Whitmer, Joseph could only translate when he was humble and faithful. One morning something had gone wrong about the house; Joseph could not translate a single syllable until he went into an orchard, prayed, and then he and Emma made amends (*CHC* 1:131). Joseph's ability to translate apparently increased as the work progressed.

Most reports state that throughout the project Joseph used the ""Nephite interpreters"" or, for convenience, he would use a seer stone (see *CHC* 1:128-30). Both instruments were sometimes called by others the Urim and Thummim. In 1830, Oliver Cowdery is reported to have testified in court that these tools enabled Joseph ""to read in English, the reformed Egyptian characters, which were engraved on the plates"" (Benton, *Evangelical Magazine and Gospel Advocate* 2 [Apr. 9, 1831]:15). In an 1891 interview, William Smith indicated that when his brother Joseph used the ""interpreters"" (which were like a silver bow twisted into the shape of a figure eight with two stones between the rims of the bow connected by a rod to a breastplate), his hands were left free to hold the plates. Other late reports mention a variety of further details, but they cannot be historically confirmed or denied.",3

I, as well as all of my father's family, Smith's wife, Oliver Cowdery, and Martin Harris were present during the translation. The translation was by Smith and the manner as follows: … ""He did not use the plates in the translation, but would hold the interpreters to his eyes and cover his face with a hat, excluding all light, and before his eyes would appear what seemed to be parchment, on which would appear the characters of the plates in a line at the top, and immediately below would appear the translation in English, which Smith would read to his scribe, who wrote it down exactly as it fell from his lips.

This book is a translation of an ancient record inscribed on gold plates which, in September 1827, were delivered by an angel to Joseph Smith, a twenty-one-year-old youth.

When the angel first advised Joseph concerning the plates, he said, to quote Joseph, ""that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that … there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in [the record]. …

""Also, that there were two stones in silver bows—and these stones, fastened to a breastplate, constituted what is called the Urim and Thummim—deposited with the plates; and the possession and use of these stones were what constituted 'seers' in ancient or former times; and that God had prepared them for the purpose of translating the book."" (JS—H 1:33–35.)

By the power of God, Joseph translated the record and in 1830 published the translation in book form, under the title the Book of Mormon.

The record revealed the fact that Mormon was the father of Moroni. He was an able military leader in his day, a learned historian, and a great prophet. He lived in America during the last half of the fourth century a.d. The book bears his name because he made a compilation and an abridgment of the then extant historical records. His abridgment constituted most of what Joseph Smith translated from the gold plates, which he received from Moroni, who had deposited them in the Hill Cumorah, located in western New York state, in about a.d. 421.",2

The Book of Mormon stands as a miraculous work for the world to examine. This divine spark from heaven, over 165 years ago, has ignited a flame that is dawning a new day. No wonder ""the Spirit of God like a fire is burning!"" (*Hymns,* 1985, no. 2). All over the world people are seeking the witness of Jesus Christ as found in the Book of Mormon. They come from every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. As was revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, ""The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name"" (D&C 122:1). And why are they seeking after the name of Joseph Smith? Because the Book of Mormon testifies of the divinity and atonement of the Savior, Jesus Christ. Because Joseph is the prophet of the Restoration.

The Book of Mormon is the ""keystone of our religion"" and will bring us ""nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book"" (*Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,* p. 194).

Joseph Smith once made the statement that the Book of Mormon was the keystone of this religion, that a person could get closer to God by following its precepts than by any other book. Joseph Smith has long since passed away.

His life was threatened and mobs tried to rob him of the plates, requiring him to hide the ancient records and often move them from place to place (see JS—H 1:60). Joseph had no telephone, no dictating equipment, fax, word processor, or copy machine—not even electric light.

Joseph had little formal education, perhaps no more than three years of elementary school. Prior to his translation Joseph had not enrolled in a university. There were no literary magazines or academic periodicals delivered to his doorstep. He never visited South America or the Middle East. He belonged to no professional societies, had performed no extensive research projects, nor did he have learned colleagues with whom to discuss the ancient text of the plates. He may have studied basic reading, writing, and arithmetic and perhaps a little American history. We know he read the Bible in English, but by the standards of the world, Joseph was neither a scholar nor a theologian, much less a professional translator of holy scriptures.

What skills did Joseph possess to aid in his translation? Oliver Cowdery, who was the principal scribe for the Book of Mormon, said of Joseph's source of translating power that ""the Prophet Joseph Smith … translated [the Book of Mormon] by the gift and power of God, by the [assistance or] means of the Urim and Thummim"" (""Last Days of Oliver Cowdery,"" *Deseret News,* 13 Apr. 1859, p. 48).",2

He translated the engravings on these plates by the gift and power of God and by revelation, and to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.

We have this promise given by Moroni regarding the Book of Mormon:

""And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

""And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things."" (Moro. 10:4–5.)

An 1835 edition, published in Kirtland, Ohio, was entitled *Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints* and contained 103 sections. In subsequent editions, more sections were added (see Doctrine and Covenants Editions). The most recent additions were sections 137 (1836) and 138 (1918) on salvation of the dead, and the Official Declaration 2 announcing the priesthood available to every worthy male member of the Church (1978). An article on marriage written by Oliver Cowdery in 1835 was deleted from the 1876 edition. Beginning with the 1921 edition, a set of lessons called the Lectures on Faith have not been included.

One hundred of the revelations were received before 1834, during the early, formative years of the Church. Many of them were addressed to specific individuals who sought wisdom from the Prophet. Gospel doctrines were often not revealed in their fulness at first, but were received progressively from time to time. As the Church grew and relocated, questions regarding Church administration, duties of officers, guidance for the members of the Church, and events of the future became the subjects of further revelations.

Not all the revelations received by Joseph Smith are included in the Doctrine and Covenants (see unpublished revelations). Some are contained in the *History of the Church*, giving counsel and instruction to individuals (*HC* 1:229), concerning the Saints being driven to the Rocky Mountains (*HC* 5:85), and a prophecy about Stephen A. Douglas (*HC* 5:393-94).",0

**Lecture One**
1. Faith [is] the first principle in revealed religion, and the foundation of all righteousness.
9. Faith is the assurance which men have of the existence of things which they have not seen and&#133;the principle of action in all intelligent beings.
12. As faith is the moving cause of all action in temporal concerns, so it is in spiritual.
13. But faith is not only the principle of action, but it is also the principle of power in all intelligent beings, whether in heaven or on earth.
15. The principle of power which existed in the bosom of God, by which he framed the worlds, was faith.

**Lecture Two**
55. Let us here observe that after any members of the human family are made acquainted with the important fact that there is a God who has created and does uphold all things, the extent of their knowledge respecting his character and glory will depend upon their diligence and faithfulness in seeking after him, until, like Enoch, the brother of Jared, and Moses, they shall obtain faith in God and power with him to behold him face to face.",3

The same source indicates that in January 1835 Joseph was engaged in ""preparing the lectures on theology for publication"" (*HC* 2:180).

Because of our location in time and good record keeping, we are privileged to have an up close and personal view of the production of modern scriptural canon, and as we get into it, it's a bit of a rollercoaster. From its first publication in 1835 to its current version today, the Doctrine and Covenants has undergone major additions, deletions, rearrangements, and textual changes. In today's episode of *Church History Matters*, we'll take a ride through the history of this iterative production of the Doctrine and Covenants, from its earliest 1833 version, known as the Book of Commandments, to its 1835 version, which added new revelations and seven major theological lectures known as the Lectures on Faith, to the 1844 version, which added a few crucial revelations and was the last version most of the branches of the Restoration agreed upon after Joseph's death, to the 1876 version, which contained massive additions and rearranging, to the 1921 version, which decanonized the Lectures on Faith, and finally to the version we use today, which underwent revisions as recently as 2013. So please keep your arms and legs inside at all times as we now embark on our tour of the ongoing story of the Doctrine and Covenants. I'm Scott Woodward, and my co-host is Casey Griffiths.

The school was organized to help Church leaders and missionaries ""[qualify] themselves as messengers of Jesus Christ, to be ready to do His will in carrying glad tidings to all that would open their eyes, ears, and hearts,"" by being ""more perfectly instructed in the great things of God"" (*HC* 2:169-70; *see also* Schools of the Prophets).

The lectures address three major themes: ""first, faith itself-what it is; secondly, the object on which it rests; and thirdly, the effects which flow from it"" (Dahl and Tate, p. 31). The first lecture explains what faith is; the second shows how the knowledge of God first came into the world and traces this knowledge from Adam to Abraham; the third and fourth discuss the necessary and unchanging attributes of God; the fifth deals with the nature of God the Father, his son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost; the sixth teaches that acquiring faith unto salvation depends on knowing that one's life is pleasing to God, which knowledge can be obtained only by the willingness to sacrifice all earthly things; and the seventh treats the fruits of faith-perspective, power, and ultimately perfection. In the 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants the seven lectures comprised seventy-four pages. The lectures are organized in numbered paragraphs in which principles are stated and supporting scriptures quoted.

Renamed the *Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints*, the book was presented to, and accepted by, the members of the Church in an August 1835 conference as the word of God. The change in name to Doctrine and Covenants reflected a change in content. Unlike the Book of Commandments, which contained revelations only, the Doctrine and Covenants was divided into two parts. The new first part consisted of seven theological presentations now known as the Lectures on Faith but then titled ""On the Doctrine of the Church of the Latter Day Saints."" The part including the revelations published previously, the original preface, and a number of new revelations not in the 1833 compilation, were titled ""Part Second, Covenants and Commandments."" The title of the Doctrine and Covenants reflects the subtitles of these two parts.

In preparing the 1835 edition, Joseph Smith and a committee appointed to the task on September 24, 1834 (*HC* 2:165, 243-44) edited the revelations that had formerly appeared in the Book of Commandments. They corrected scribal and printing errors and occasionally clarified the text. They added explanations of the duties of officers that were new in the Church organization since the earlier revelations were received.

Although it is impossible to evaluate the long-term impact of the lectures on LDS belief and teaching, the process of producing the lectures led early Church leaders to articulate and synthesize some of what they had learned from the revelations of the Restoration with the understanding of the Bible that they inherited from American Christianity. Although these lectures have received limited attention from most Latter-day Saints, others have taken them quite seriously and praised their value. LDS scripturalist and apostle Bruce R. McConkie wrote regarding the lectures, ""They were not themselves classed as revelations, but in them is to be found some of the best lesson material ever prepared on the Godhead; on the character, perfections, and attributes of God; on faith, miracles, and sacrifice. They can be studied with great profit by all gospel scholars"" (*MD*, p. 439). The 1990 republication of the lectures signals the desire of some LDS scholars to stimulate interest in their historical and doctrinal significance for the Church.",2

The major change in the 1921 edition was the removal of the ""Lectures on Faith,"" which were not considered to be revelations. The committee also revised the footnotes and divided the pages into double columns. Even though the name of the collection had been changed in the 1835 edition to signal the addition of the ""Lectures on Faith,"" it was not changed back when the lectures were deleted. The 1921 edition was the standard until 1981.

**THE 1981 EDITION.** A committee appointed by the First Presidency of the Church directed the publication of a new edition of the Doctrine and Covenants in 1981. New features included completely revised footnotes and rewritten introductory headings for each section. Two additional sections and a second official declaration were also incorporated. Section 137 is a portion of a vision of the Celestial Kingdom given to Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple on January 21, 1836. Section 138 is a vision about the redemption of the dead given to Joseph F. Smith, sixth President of the Church, in 1918. Official Declaration-2 is the 1978 announcement by the First Presidency that all worthy male members of the Church can be ordained to the priesthood.

Our missionaries could well answer in the words of Paul, that peerless missionary of an earlier day: ""For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!""5

The holy scriptures contain no proclamation more relevant, no responsibility more binding, no instruction more direct than the injunction given by the resurrected Lord as He appeared in Galilee to the eleven disciples. Said He:

""All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

""Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

""Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.""6

This divine command, coupled with its glorious promise, is our watchword today, as it was in the meridian of time. Missionary work is an identifying feature of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Always has it been; ever shall it be. As the Prophet Joseph Smith declared, ""After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel.""7

Within two short years, all of the full-time missionaries currently serving in this royal army of God will have concluded their full-time labors and will have returned to their homes and loved ones. Their replacements are found tonight in the ranks of the Aaronic Priesthood of the Church. Young men, are you ready to respond? Are you willing to work? Are you prepared to serve?",3

They learn by their sacrifice what only personal experience and devoted service to others can teach.

A missionary learns, for example, that God can use him as an instrument to accomplish His work. He can say, as did Ammon, a Book of Mormon missionary, ""This is [a] blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work."" (Alma 26:3.)

A missionary learns that he must be humble and dependent on the Lord. He learns to pray with fervor and sincerity, not only for himself but for others, and to be led and directed by the Spirit.

It was while I was on my first mission that I discovered the constant need for dependence on the Lord.",3

Jesus himself was an apostle through whom God spoke (Heb. 1:2;3:1). The Father sent Jesus, and whoever receives him receives the one who sent him (Mark 9:37; John 8:16-19). As the Father sent him, so Jesus sent his apostles (John 20:21). Initially, they were called from those who ""companied with us [the Twelve] all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us"" (Acts 1:21). The number twelve, associated with the apostles, echoes the number of tribes of Israel whom the apostles are to judge (Matt. 19:28; Luke 22:30). In this connection, they stood as the foundation of the early Christian church (Eph. 2:19-21;4:11-14).

At times, the term embraces more than the Twelve, as is implied both in the phrase ""all the apostles"" (1 Cor. 15:7)-which follows particular mention of ""the Twelve"" by Paul (1 Cor. 15:5)-and in references to persons named as apostles who were known not to be among the Twelve (Acts 14:14; Rom. 16:7). It is probable that by A.D. 54 the Lord's brother James had become one of the Twelve (1 Cor. 15:7; Gal. 1:19). Even so, most New Testament references to apostles refer to members of Jesus' original Twelve or to Paul. They were the guarantors or prime witnesses of Jesus' resurrection, which itself constituted the assurance that he was the expected Messiah and Lord of glory (Acts 1:8-11). In the first century, apostles were traveling witnesses to Jesus' resurrection, sent by him into the world for this purpose (Acts 1:8; cf. Matt. 28:19-20). At the group's core-and the Church's foundation-stood Peter, James, and John, who had been with or near Jesus during critical experiences, including his transfiguration (Mark 9:2-9) and his agony in Gethsemane (Mark 14:32-34).",2

That one moment in time changed everything forever. The Savior broke down every barrier that stood in the way of our return to a loving Heavenly Father. In return He asks that we ""go … and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

""Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world"" (Matt. 28:19–20).

A more intimate version of the same message is recorded in the Gospel of John. On the shore of the Sea of Galilee, Jesus asked Peter three times, ""Lovest thou me?"" Each time Peter's reply was the same: ""Thou knowest that I love thee."" And each time the Savior instructed Peter: ""Feed my lambs. … Feed my sheep. … Feed my sheep"" (John 21:15–17).

The Savior's impassioned charge to ""feed [His] sheep"" continues in force today. Like Peter and his brethren of old, the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ today have the charge to take the gospel to all the world. This charge is seldom far from our minds. Every General Authority has the responsibility to be a missionary.

But the Savior was not just talking to the Apostles. He was also talking to every person who has been blessed to hear the gospel and is a member of His Church. In revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord puts it in very simple terms: ""It becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor"" (D&C 88:81).",3

Missionaries consider themselves emissaries of the Lord in proclaiming his message.

**WHO ARE CALLED.** In the first generation of the Church, married men frequently were called to be missionaries, and they left wives and families for an indeterminate length of time. In recent decades, the majority of missionaries have been young men and women who serve about two years.

Currently, the Church calls as missionaries, on a voluntary, temporary basis, single men from the ages of nineteen to twenty-six, single women twenty-one years and older, and older married couples with no dependent children. Missionary service is coordinated with military service as required.

Missionaries or their families generally cover the major costs of serving a mission. Missionaries called from developing nations may receive needed financial assistance from the general missionary fund of the Church. This assistance covers only basic living costs, as the Church has no paid ministry. No one is paid for missionary service.",3

Eight men were called as General Authorities. Six women were called to the presidencies of the Relief Society and Young Women. Over two hundred men were called to serve as bishops, and over seventeen hundred men and women were called as full-time missionaries. In that same month, tens of thousands of others were called as officers and teachers and other workers in the many Church organizations throughout the world. Those called in April joined millions of others already serving in similar capacities in the restored Church.

As I contemplated my own calling and the callings of millions of others already in service, I was led to consider this question: Why do we serve?

Service is an imperative for those who worship Jesus Christ. To followers who were vying for prominent positions in his kingdom, the Savior taught, ""Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant."" (Matt. 20:27.) On a later occasion, he spoke of ministering to the needs of the hungry, the naked, the sick, and the imprisoned. He concluded that teaching with these words: ""Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."" (Matt. 25:40.)",2

He said, ""I don't want to go."" I asked, ""What has that got to do with it? We need you.""

President Kimball has said we don't have *half enough* missionaries. Can't you see that it doesn't matter whether you want to go or not? You're needed! Do you know what it means to be needed? The bonds of brotherhood are forged deep and strong in the mission field. You will develop a love for a companion with whom you kneel in daily prayer. You will learn to love the people where you serve, no matter what nationality or condition. And they will love you. They will love you because you brought them the gospel.

Converts always remember those who taught them. I've heard many converts speak almost reverently of ""our missionaries."" Imagine having people pray for you. Do you understand what that means? This will always be a purifying and refining influence in your life.

Many people out there are praying for the truth. You are the one who can bring it to them best. At present only 18,000 of you are serving. There are nearly 60,000, 19 through 25, who have not. We need more, many more. Missionary service is not preempted by any other thing. Marriage does not take precedence. Your work does not have priority. Your education is interrupted to fill this calling. College-related activities may be timed to satisfy both school and mission requirements. Some of you may be physically handicapped. There may yet be opportunity to serve in fitting ways locally.

Your moral worthiness is a prime consideration. We want no flabbiness of character when spiritual strength is required. Study! Get some colored pencils. Keep them with your Book of Mormon. Underline verses important to you. Another tool of missionary work is an additional language. Study one. We should ""become acquainted with … languages, tongues, and people."" (D&C 90:15.)",3

People serve one another for different reasons, and some reasons are better than others. Perhaps none of us serves in every capacity all the time for only a single reason. Since we are imperfect beings, most of us probably serve for a combination of reasons, and the combinations may be different from time to time as we grow spiritually. But we should all strive to serve for the reasons that are highest and best.

What are some of the reasons for service? By way of illustration, and without pretending to be exhaustive, I will suggest six reasons. I will discuss these in ascending order from the lesser to the greater reasons for service.

Some may serve for hope of earthly reward. Such a man or woman might serve in Church positions or in private acts of mercy in an effort to achieve prominence or cultivate contacts that would increase income or aid in acquiring wealth.

There is far greater flexibility in the service opportunities of couples than for single elders or sisters. In consultation with your bishop, you can indicate your own preferences for missionary service. We must train a growing number of fathers and mothers and priesthood and auxiliary leaders throughout the world who want very much to serve the Lord but simply do not know how to do it. You can help them as a leadership missionary couple. You can serve in temples, family history, educational and medical activities, welfare service projects, public affairs, and visitors' centers. There is a need for almost every discipline of life. There is undoubtedly a need somewhere in the world for your unique capacities and talents. Often special health considerations can be accommodated. The feelings you express to the bishop are communicated in a recommendation for a call. The President of the Church has made it possible for those calls to be inspired of the Lord, taking into consideration your special needs and desires as a couple. Stake presidents and bishops are kept aware of current full-time missionary needs. If you cannot find anyone locally to identify potential missionary opportunities, write to the Missionary Department at headquarters. We will send you a list of the current needs.

Some may serve out of fear of punishment. The scriptures abound with descriptions of the miserable state of those who fail to follow the commandments of God. Thus, King Benjamin taught his people that the soul of the unrepentant transgressor would be filled with ""a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.""

With so many converts the little branches grow rapidly. New leaders are called to positions of service early. They are able but inexperienced in Church procedures and administration.

The decision to serve a mission will shape the spiritual destiny of the missionary, his or her spouse, and their posterity for generations to come. A desire to serve is a natural outcome of one's conversion, worthiness, and preparation.

Religion, eternal truth, and our missionaries are vital parts of that help.

Our young missionaries set aside their education, occupation, dating, and whatever else young adults would typically be doing at this stage of life. For 18 to 24 months they put it all on hold because of their deep desire to serve the Lord.2 And some of our missionaries serve in their more mature years of life. I know their families are blessed.

Service of the character I have just described is worthy of praise and will surely qualify for blessings, especially if it is done willingly and joyfully. As the Apostle Paul wrote in his second letter to the Corinthians:

""But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

""Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver."" (2 Cor. 9:6–7.)

Third, be obedient, faithful, and true. Missionaries serve in companionships for protection. A missionary best protects his companion when he is loyal to the Lord and helps his companion. By keeping the missionary rules, you gain the freedom of having the Spirit assist you.

Fourth, teach and testify. ""And ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two, in my name, lifting up your voices as with the sound of a trump, declaring my word like unto angels of God.""7",1

The Savior applied that principle in the Sermon on the Mount, in which he commanded us to love our enemies, bless them that curse us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them that despitefully use us and persecute us. (See Matt. 5:44.) He explained the purpose of that commandment as follows:

""For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?

""And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?"" (Matt. 5:46–47.)

This principle—that our service should be for the love of God and the love of fellowmen rather than for personal advantage or any other lesser motive—is admittedly a high standard. The Savior must have seen it so, since he joined his commandment for selfless and complete love directly with the ideal of perfection. The very next verse of the Sermon on the Mount contains this great commandment: ""Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."" (Matt. 5:48.)

This principle of service is reaffirmed in the fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants:

""Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day."" (D&C 4:2.)

We learn from this command that it is not enough to serve God with all of our *might and strength.* He who looks into our hearts and knows our minds demands more than this. In order to stand blameless before God at the last day, we must also serve him with all our *heart and mind.*

Service with all of our heart and mind is a high challenge for all of us. Such service must be free of selfish ambition. It must be motivated only by the pure love of Christ.",0

I am thrilled with this calling.

 If there were no converts, the Church would shrivel and die. But perhaps the greatest reason for missionary work is to give the world its chance to hear and accept the gospel. The scriptures are replete with *commands* and *promises* and *calls* and *rewards* for teaching the gospel. I use the word *command* advisedly, for it seems to be an insistent directive from which we, singly and collectively, cannot escape. Furthermore, the command is clear that not only must all members of His church give missionary service, but we must take the gospel to all the children of our Heavenly Father on this earth [p. 4].",3

Most of our missionaries are young men and women who serve for one and a half to two years, and do so without financial remuneration, supporting their service from personal savings and contributions from family members and loved ones.

Our missionaries are now teaching the gospel throughout the world in sixty-nine languages. When released, they return home to resume their education and the normal pursuits of life. But they also continue as advocates of the people whose culture, language, and ways they have come to love. They serve because the Lord issued a commandment: ""Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost"" (Matt. 28:19; see also Mark 16:15). On another occasion, the Master stated: ""Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God"" John 3:5). We comply by performing baptisms by immersion and then conferring the gift of the Holy Ghost by the imposition of hands by those duly authorized.

The Savior stands with His hands extended, offering us glorious blessings if we will serve Him. As we study what He means by this service we come to understand that it is fundamentally the service of teaching the truths of His gospel to those who do not know it.

But even with the simplicity of the words and the divine source from which they come, and even with the sure promise of blessings, there are still those who should and could serve who choose not to serve.

It causes me to wonder if they really understand and believe the twofold nature of the purpose of missionary work: first, to sanctify the missionary himself, and second, to bring converts to a knowledge of the truths of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and to baptism into His Church—which is the sure and natural product of a missionary who is in the process of sanctification.",1

The future growth of the Church will not happen through just knocking on strangers' doors. It will happen when the members, along with our missionaries, filled with the love of God and Christ discern needs and respond to those needs in the spirit of charitable service.

When we do this, brothers and sisters, the honest in heart will feel our sincerity and our love. Many will want to know more about us. Then and only then will the Church expand to fill all of the earth. This cannot be accomplished by missionaries alone but requires the interest and service of every member.

In all of our service, we need to be sensitive to the promptings of the Holy Ghost. The still, small voice will let us know who needs our help and what we can do to help them.

This service is as much for your benefit as it is for the benefit of the Church and the nonmembers who receive your message. We are grateful for the increasing numbers of young men and couples who are serving missions.

While there are many ways to help in the gathering, I would like to speak of one in particular: serving as a full-time missionary. For many of you, this will mean being a teaching missionary. For many others, it will mean being a service missionary. But the world tries to distract youth from this most sacred responsibility using fear and insecurities.

Some other distractions might be experiencing a pandemic, leaving a good job, putting off education, or being particularly interested in someone romantically. Everyone will have his or her own set of challenges. Such distractions can arise at precisely the time of embarking in the service of the Lord, and choices that seem obvious later are not always as easy in the moment.

I know from experience the troubled mind of such a young person. When I was preparing to go on my mission, some surprising forces tried to discourage me. One was my dentist.

They also called upon others to help them fulfill the Lord's command.

Today, under the direction of modern apostles and prophets, that same charge has been extended to missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. These missionaries serve in more than 150 nations. As representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ, they strive to fulfill that divine command—renewed in our day by the Lord Himself—to take the fulness of the gospel abroad and bless the lives of people everywhere.6

Missionaries in their late teens or early 20s are young in ways of the world. But they are blessed with gifts—such as the power of the Holy Spirit, the love of God, and testimonies of the truth—that make them powerful ambassadors of the Lord. They share the good news of the gospel that will bring true joy and everlasting happiness to all who heed their message. And in many instances they do so in a country and a language foreign to them.

Missionaries strive to follow Jesus Christ in both word and deed. They preach of Jesus Christ and of His Atonement.7 They teach of the literal Restoration of Christ's ancient Church through the Lord's first latter-day prophet, Joseph Smith.

Proclaiming the gospel is not an activity in which we periodically and temporarily engage.

Rather, the obligation to proclaim the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is inherent in the oath and covenant of the priesthood into which we enter. Missionary work essentially is a priesthood responsibility, and all of us who hold the priesthood are the Lord's authorized servants on the earth and are missionaries at all times and in all places—and we always will be. Our very identity as holders of the priesthood and the seed of Abraham is in large measure defined by the responsibility to proclaim the gospel.

Isn't it interesting that the last chapter of each of the Gospels contains an appeal from the risen Lord to spread the gospel.

On the wall of the main floor of the Church Office Building in Salt Lake City is a magnificent mural depicting Jesus Christ as a resurrected being standing among his eleven Apostles as he gives them a stirring charge to be missionaries to all the world:

""Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

""Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen."" (Matt. 28:19–20.)

The Apostles who there stood with the Son of God responded to this call with faith, boldness, and power. We read that they were ""all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness."" (Acts 4:31.) They had seen a resurrected being, had eaten with him, had felt his hands and feet. They knew, and knowing, they testified: ""For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard."" (Acts 4:20.)

Does that commission extend to us as his disciples? Perhaps we have not seen, in person, the risen Lord. But the testimony of his chosen witnesses is etched into our hearts by the Holy Spirit. We know, and knowing, we too must testify. Is there any question in the mind of any of us that this is one of the chief responsibilities we enjoy by reason of our membership in his Church?

""For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it."" (Matt. 16:24–25.)

The word *deny* implies sacrifice or giving up one's personal desires for the happiness of others. We often hear it said that a missionary sacrifices two years of his life to serve the Lord. In the beginning he may think it a sacrifice, especially when the work becomes difficult and the disappointments are numerous; but the sooner the missionary learns to keep the commandments of the Lord, deny himself, as the Savior admonished his disciples, sacrifice his own desires for those of others for the building up of the kingdom of God, and lose himself in the work, then will he find true happiness in his missionary labors.

With each sacrifice his testimony is strengthened, for to sacrifice is to obey and to love his fellowman. Missionary work is not easy and requires difficult personal discipline with many self-denials.",2

He made no changes in Ruth, Ezra, Esther, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Obadiah, Micah, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Malachi, Philemon, 2 John, and 3 John.

**TITLE.** Joseph Smith's work with the Bible has been known by various titles. The revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants call it a ""translation"" (D&C 37:1;90:13). Joseph Smith called it the ""new translation,"" and it is known by this title in the early literature of the Church. It was published by the RLDS Church under the title ""Holy Scriptures,"" with the later subtitle, ""Inspired Version."" Many call it an ""inspired revision."" In 1978 the LDS Church officially labeled it the ""Joseph Smith Translation,"" abbreviated JST.",3

The message of the Bible is held to be true, while details of accuracy and completeness are accepted within certain limits. The Prophet Joseph Smith explained: ""I believe the Bible as it read when it came from the pen of the original writers. Ignorant translators, careless transcribers, or designing and corrupt priests have committed many errors"" (*TPJS*, p. 327). And again, ""From sundry revelations which had been received, it was apparent that many points touching the salvation of men, had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled"" (*TPJS*, pp. 9-10).

Joseph Smith often used the words ""translated"" and ""translation,"" not in the narrow sense alone of rendering a text from one language into another, but in the wider senses of ""transmission,"" having reference to copying, editing, adding to, taking from, rephrasing, and interpreting. This is substantially beyond the usual meaning of ""translation."" When he said the Bible was not translated correctly, he not only was referring to the difficulties of rendering the Bible into another language but he was also observing that the manuscripts containing the text of the Bible have suffered at the hands of editors, copyists, and revisionists through centuries of transmission. Thus, the available texts of the Bible are neither as complete nor as accurate as when first written.",3

The translation process was revelatory and educational, and was a means of expanding the Prophet Joseph Smith's knowledge and doctrinal awareness (cf. D&C 45:60-61). The contributions, therefore, go beyond the particular biblical text that may have initiated the process. Among the doctrines of the LDS Church that arose from the JST translation process are the building of Zion, patterned after Enoch's city; the age of accountability of children, with baptism at eight years; the extensive revelation about the degrees of glory and plural marriage (including celestial, eternal marriage); and various items of priesthood organization and responsibility. These and other doctrines were often introduced during the translation process and later developed through subsequent revelations now contained in the Doctrine and Covenants. Revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants received during the translation process are sections 76, 77, 86, and 91, and parts of 107 and 132. In this way the JST has affected the spiritual life of every member of the Church, even though most of the members have not known of the JST.

The tangible product-the printed JST-consists of a Bible with thousands of unique corrections, additions, and readings. Although many Latter-day Saints regard this as the most correct version of the Bible now available, and therefore use it as a valuable source for biblical understanding, the wider contribution has probably been the enlightening effect that the process had upon Joseph Smith and the subsequent revelations through him that have shaped Church doctrine and practice. Most of the doctrinal and organizational revelations that have governed the Church, and that are now published in the Doctrine and Covenants, came to Joseph Smith during the period that he was translating the Bible (1830-1833).",1

His translation was not done in the usual manner of a scholar, but was a revelatory experience using only an English text. He did not leave a description of the translating process, but it appears that he would read from the KJV and dictate revisions to a scribe.

Joseph Smith was assisted by various scribes. The manuscript shows that Oliver Cowdery was the first, serving between June and October 1830; he recorded an introductory revelation (Moses 1) and the translation of KJV Genesis 1:1to Genesis 4:18. John Whitmer served second, from October until December 1830, recording the translation of KJV Genesis 4:19to approximately Genesis 5:20. Sidney Rigdon was next, becoming the main scribe from early December 1830 until the translation was finished on July 2, 1833. He recorded most of the translation from KJV Genesis 5:21to the end of the Bible, although others recorded small portions.",2

This was followed by many subsequent printings, all from the same stereotype plates. In 1936 a teacher's edition containing study helps was published by the RLDS Church. At that time a subtitle, ""Inspired Version,"" was added, although the text remained the same as the 1867 edition. In 1944 a ""New Corrected Edition"" was published by the RLDS Church in which at least 352 verses were amended to correct typographical and judgment errors in the 1867 edition. These corrections were matters of detail, although in a few instances they significantly affected the meaning of the passages and brought the printed text into closer harmony with the manuscript. In 1970 a parallel column edition consisting of the Inspired Version and the King James Version was issued by the RLDS Church publishing house.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has never published the entire Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible. Portions of Genesis and of Matthew, distributed during the time of Joseph Smith in Kirtland and in Nauvoo, are included in the Pearl of Great Price under the title Book of Moses (JST Gen. 1 through 8:18) and Joseph Smith-Matthew (JST Matt. 24). Extensive portions of JST Genesis 1-5 and a single excerpt each from Romans and Hebrews were used in the Lectures on Faith and are still published therein. In 1979 the LDS Church published an edition of the King James Version with hundreds of JST footnotes and a seventeen-page appendix containing JST excerpts (see Bible: LDS Publication of the Bible).",3

The vision asserts (1) that the ancient authors wrote under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, (2) that originally their words contained the fulness of the gospel and were plain and easy to understand, but (3) that many things which were plain and precious, and many covenants, would be ""taken away"" from the original manuscripts; as a result, afterward (4) a great many persons, even with a Bible, would not understand the fulness of the gospel, but (5) the lost material would be restored through ""other records"" that the Lord would bring forth (1 Ne. 13:21-41). A somewhat parallel statement came to Joseph Smith in June 1830 while he was restoring a revelation received by Moses, declaring that many things would be taken ""from the book"" which Moses would write, but that the missing information would be restored through another prophet and thus be ""had again"" among those who believe (Moses 1:41). Latter-day Saints believe that the ""other records"" referred to include the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, the JST, and other records still to come forth, and that the prophet divinely raised up to begin restoring the lost material is Joseph Smith (see Scriptures: Forthcoming Scripture). In light of the foregoing statements, it is worth observing that the principal difficulty in the Bible apparently has been omissions.

This appointment can be illustrated by excerpts from his writings. After laboring off and on for ten months on the early chapters of Genesis, Joseph Smith received a revelation from the Lord on March 7, 1831, directing him to begin work on the New Testament: ""It shall not be given unto you to know any further concerning this chapter, until the New Testament be translated, and in it all these things shall be made known; wherefore I give unto you that ye may now translate it"" (D&C 45:60-61). The manuscript of the JST shows that Joseph Smith began the translation of Matthew the next day. On December 1, 1831, the Prophet entered the following in his journal: ""I resumed the translation of the Scriptures, and continued to labor in this branch of my calling with Elder Sidney Rigdon as my scribe"" (*HC* 1:238-39). On February 16, 1832, he reported a revelation concerning the resurrection of the dead that includes the following reference to his divine commission to translate: ""For while we [Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon] were doing the work of translation, which the Lord had appointed unto us, we came to the twenty-ninth verse of the fifth chapter of John"" (D&C 76:15). On March 8, 1833, he reported the word of the Lord to him as follows: ""And when you have finished the translation of the [Old Testament] prophets, you shall from thenceforth preside over the affairs of the church"" (D&C 90:13). On May 6, 1833, Joseph Smith reported the following revelation: ""It is my will that you should hasten to translate my scriptures"" (D&C 93:53). Although not a complete list, the foregoing items illustrate Joseph Smith's claim to a divine appointment to translate the Old and New Testaments.",2

Joseph once commented that the book was ""translated into our own language"" (*TPJS*, p. 17; cf. D&C 1:24). In several chapters, for good and useful reasons, this meant that the language would follow the King James idiom of the day (*see CWHN* 8:212-16; Welch, 1990, pp. 134-63). It also assured that the manuscript would contain human misspellings and grammatical oddities, implying that if it had been translated in another decade its phraseology and vocabulary might have been slightly different.

At the same time, circumstantial evidence in the English text suggests that the translation was quite precise. For example, the independent and identical translations of 1 Nephi 1:8 andof Alma 36:22(precisely quoting twenty-one of Lehi's words in 1 Nephi 1:8) typify the internal accuracy manifested in this long and complex record. Moreover, several formulaic terms, Hebraisms, stylistic indications of multiple authorship, varieties of parallelism and extended chiasmus (see Book of Mormon Authorship; Book of Mormon Literature), as well as certain Semitic proper names and some textual variants, not at all evident from the King James Bible, corroborate the claim that the translation was faithful to a consistent underlying text.",1

Little is known about the translation process itself. Few details can be gleaned from comments made by Joseph's scribes and close associates. Only Joseph Smith knew the actual process, and he declined to describe it in public. At a Church conference in 1831, Hyrum Smith invited the Prophet to explain more fully how the Book of Mormon came forth.

""When Joseph Smith began translating the Book of Mormon in 1827, he usually left the plates in a box or wrapped in a cloth, placed the interpreters or his seer stone (both of which seem to have been called Urim and Thummim) in a hat, and read the translation he saw in the stone to a scribe. . . . When the first 116 pages of the Book of Mormon were stolen, an angel took back the interpreters, and Joseph instead used his seer stone.""8 All of this suggests that Joseph Smith's mechanism for translating the Book of Mormon, while still in some way conveying one language (Egyptian) to another (English), was more closely synonymous with revelation.9",3

For example, an entry in Joseph Smith's journal under the date November 20, 1835 indicates the Prophet ""spent the day in translating"" the Egyptian records.2 In an unpublished editorial that was apparently meant to be printed in the March 1, 1842 issue of the *Times and Seasons* (the issue that saw the publication of the first installment of the Book of Abraham), Joseph Smith signaled his desire to ""continue to translate and publish [the text] as fast as possible [until] the whole is completed.""3 What was published with the Book of Abraham was a preface announcing it as ""A TRANSLATION Of some ancient Records that have fallen into our hands . . . purporting to be the writings of Abraham.""4

But while Joseph Smith and others used the word ""translation"" to describe the production of the Book of Abraham, the *means* or *methods* Joseph used to translate ancient scripture were unique.

The production of the JST was performed by a ""translation"" method that was, by all accounts, not that kind of translation at all.

In ""translating"" the Bible, Joseph read the English KJV text and then recorded revelations that he received in doing so. Large passages of text from the JST have no extant ancient text from which they were derived, nor did Joseph claim to have those ancient texts in his possession, although he did suggest that many such revelations were representations of ancient texts that had been lost. The most obvious example is the Book of Moses, which was revealed to Joseph during his ""translation"" of Genesis, despite the fact that, as far as we know, he never saw the original ancient text of the Book of Moses. Joseph would refer to this as a translation and insist that what he had written were indeed the words of Moses, but this process did not require him to read ideas in one language and find the proper words for them in English, which is what traditional translators do.",1

Thus it is by nature declarative and informative.

1. Emphasis on Jesus Christ. The JST emphasizes that the gospel of Jesus Christ was taught in the earliest ages of mankind. According to JST Genesis 1-8 (published as Moses 1- 8 in the Pearl of Great Price), Adam, Enoch, Noah, and the other Patriarchs were preachers of righteousness and taught the gospel of Jesus Christ, including faith, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost.

The JST states that Adam was taught by a heavenly angel to offer animal sacrifice as a type and symbol of the atoning sacrifice that the Son of God would accomplish. He was instructed to do all things in the name of the Son. Adam was taught the gospel, was baptized by immersion, received the Holy Ghost, and was born of the Spirit (Moses 5, 6).

Enoch likewise knew the gospel of Jesus Christ, was ordained to the same priesthood that Adam held, and he taught these principles to others. To Enoch was given a vision that included the spirit world and future events upon the earth from his day to the second coming of Jesus Christ. He presided in a city of righteous people called Zion, which was translated and taken into heaven (Moses 6-7; see Translated Beings).

Noah was also a preacher of righteousness, ordained to the same priesthood held by Adam and Enoch, and taught the gospel of Jesus Christ to his contemporaries, including faith in Jesus Christ, baptism, and the reception of the Holy Ghost (Moses 8:12-25).",3

In contrast, Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon at the rate of about *10* pages per day, completing the task in about 85 days (Many of us feel good if we can read the book in that time.)

Such a pace is even more remarkable considering the circumstances under which the Prophet labored. In that same period, while enduring constant distractions and incessant hostility, Joseph Smith moved more than 100 miles from Harmony, Pennsylvania, to Fayette, New York.41 He applied for a copyright.42 He received revelations comprising 12 sections of the Doctrine and Covenants.43 Heavenly beings restored the holy priesthood. Yet he completed the translation in less than three months.

How appropriate to the kingdom of God on earth in the days approaching Christ's Second Coming.

On a personal note, I had just been called as a mission president and Sister Dickson and I were about to take our family to Mexico when Elder Richard G. Scott, at the time a member of the Seventy, told me of the coming forth of this special revelation. I remember tears coming to my eyes as he related to me what had happened. I was pleased beyond words, as I knew it was right and that the time had come for all mankind to have access to all of the ordinances, covenants, and blessings of the gospel.

That was almost 35 years ago, and little did I know at the time that I would spend several years of my ministry in the Seventy in the Africa West Area of the Church, among a believing, faithful people whose lives would be so affected by the 1978 revelation on priesthood. Sister Dickson and I have lived there for four years, and the experience has been wonderful and life changing for us.

As a people, West Africans believe in God, have absolutely no shame in declaring and sharing their belief with others, and have tremendous leadership capacity.

""June 8, 1978

""To all general and local priesthood officers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints throughout the world:

""Dear Brethren:

""As we have witnessed the expansion of the work of the Lord over the earth, we have been grateful that people of many nations have responded to the message of the restored gospel, and have joined the Church in ever-increasing numbers. This, in turn, has inspired us with a desire to extend to every worthy member of the Church all of the privileges and blessings which the gospel affords.

""Aware of the promises made by the prophets and presidents of the Church who have preceded us that at some time, in God's eternal plan, all of our brethren who are worthy may receive the priesthood, and witnessing the faithfulness of those from whom the priesthood has been withheld, we have pleaded long and earnestly in behalf of these, our faithful brethren, spending many hours in the Upper Room of the Temple supplicating the Lord for divine guidance.

""He has heard our prayers, and by revelation has confirmed that the long-promised day has come when every faithful, worthy man in the Church may receive the holy priesthood, with power to exercise its divine authority, and enjoy with his loved ones every blessing that flows therefrom, including the blessings of the temple. Accordingly, all worthy male members of the Church may be ordained to the priesthood without regard for race or color. Priesthood leaders are instructed to follow the policy of carefully interviewing all candidates for ordination to either the Aaronic or the Melchizedek Priesthood to insure that they meet the established standards for worthiness.

""We declare with soberness that the Lord has now made known his will for the blessing of all his children throughout the earth who will hearken to the voice of his authorized servants, and prepare themselves to receive every blessing of the gospel.",3

Less than 13 years earlier I had been given the priesthood. Now I stand at the pulpit [that] some of the greatest men of all time had occupied, with the living prophets and apostles seated directly behind me."" So that's the power of the revelation, right?

And so he listens to anybody who has any objections or just wants to know their feeling about it. There were no objections. One general authority said, ""I would've voted against such a proposal, until I experienced the feeling that I did in this room this morning."" He had stood up and said that.

In the meantime, however, he was content to gently work on what you've called the peripheries. You know, pouring out his spirit upon thousands in Africa, in spite of the ban; working through patriarchs to give seemingly impossible blessings; working, no doubt, through the Civil Rights movement; prodding Lester Bush's scholarship; guiding church leaders to build a temple in Brazil—all things that eventually converge to persuade the apostles to keenly feel a need to draw near unto the Lord on this issue so that he could draw near unto them. So I guess this history helps me understand that prophetic fallibility is always tempered with both the mercy and the wisdom of God. Like, the good news for those who made mistakes is that God is merciful, and he forgives. And the good news for the innocent and faithful who were hurt by those mistakes is that when the Lord is involved, nothing can ever go permanently wrong. Working within the constraints of man's agency, the Lord eventually got us back on course, right? I love this quote from Paul Reeve in his *Let's Talk About* book that we've been recommending.

Kimball received a revelation that returned the church to its universal roots and restored what was lost, priesthood and temple admission to people of African descent.

Like, until there was a prophet and apostles willing to humble themselves and unitedly study this out and seek his will, he never forced the issue. He just didn't speak directly on the issue.

There are many qualifications that I lack. There is so much in my effort to serve that is wanting. There is only one single thing, one qualification that can explain it. Like Peter and all of those who have since been ordained, I have *that* witness.

Another example of revelation received but not published is the revelation underlying the announcement by the First Presidency in June 1978 extending the priesthood to all worthy male members of the Church. Only an official statement concerning that revelation was published (see Doctrine and Covenants: Official Declaration 2). Other changes in the Church, such as the recent expanding of the role of the seventy, accelerating temple building, and expanding missionary activity, are viewed by Latter-day Saints as manifestations of divine direction. The revealed basis of these changes is not always published, as it more often was in the early years of the Church. As Elder James E.

And there's disunity among the Twelve, in many regards, to this issue with blacks, some about the Civil Rights movement itself, and certainly about the policy barring blacks from priesthood and temple privileges. So we compared and contrasted, for instance, Hugh B. Brown, who was very pro-Civil-Rights-movement, with Ezra Taft Benson, who felt like this was maybe a communist ploy to try to infiltrate America. Hugh B. Brown thought that the priesthood ban was simply a policy that could be changed by vote, and so he actually put it to the Twelve to have them vote, and then Harold B. Lee really pushed strongly back against that. He wasn't in the meeting. When he found out about it, he pushed back and said, ""Listen, this is a doctrine. This is not a policy. This is a doctrine from the beginning. You can't just vote on it. This would take a revelation from heaven."" And so we have this—different apostles seeing this differently, not seeing eye to eye. And so when President Kimball becomes president—I think we ended our last episode with him becoming president in 1973, that at the beginning of his presidency he wrote to his son Edward, saying, ""Revelations will probably never come unless they're desired."" You've got to want the revelation. And he said, ""I believe most revelations will come when a man is on his tiptoes, reaching as high as he can for something which he knows he needs, and then there bursts upon him the answer to his problems."" So today we want to talk about that. What does President Kimball do to begin reaching for a revelation, which we know comes on June 1, 1978, at least to the whole First Presidency and Twelve.

As made clear in Official Declaration-2 (appended to the Doctrine and Covenants in September 1978), there had long been an anticipation that the priesthood would be made available to all worthy men-an anticipation realized and announced June 9, 1978.

In the October 1978 Semiannual General Conference of the Church, President Spencer W.

Now, we're getting a little ahead of the story here, but the basic point we want to end today's discussion with, to wrap this all up, is that it's going to take a revelation from heaven to cut through the tangle of false doctrines and false memories introduced by the human element of God's servants, as we've talked about today.",1

""That they may be conferred upon [men] it is true; but when [they] undertake to cover [their] sins, or to gratify [their] pride, [their] vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, … the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man …

""No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;

""By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile"" (D&C 121:36–37, 41–42).

This priesthood authority has divine power to confer sacred ordinances that are binding for all eternity. To illustrate, a husband and wife may be eternally married so that even after death, they and their family can be together forever in the presence of Deity. This enabling ordinance is performed in our holy temples. Furthermore, these and other necessary ordinances of salvation, such as baptism, may be performed by living individuals as proxy for deceased family members.",1

Unable to condone continuation of the practice of plural marriage or the leadership of Brigham Young, who supported it, and ambivalent about the proper line of succession to her husband, Emma made her first priority after her husband's death the preservation of an inheritance for her five living children. Distinguishing Joseph's personal property from that of the Church defied easy solution, however, and involved Brigham Young and Emma Smith in a series of complex and often bitter legal entanglements. Brigham Young, as president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and steward of the Church, claimed all that he felt rightfully belonged to its members. Emma Smith, as guardian of Joseph's children, just as vigorously claimed their share, to which she had contributed throughout her marriage to Joseph. Unable to reach an amicable solution and unwilling to accept plural marriage even in principle, Emma elected to remain in Nauvoo with her family while Brigham Young led the majority of Church members to the Rocky Mountains in 1846. On December 23, 1847, Emma Smith married Lewis Bidamon, a non-Mormon, further estranging her from the Church, to which she had once been known as the Elect Lady. Bidamon assisted Emma in raising her five children and remained her companion until her death in 1879 in Nauvoo.",3

Samuel Smith was an industrious farmer and a Nauvoo city alderman, among other things. Joseph Smith, Sr., was both financially devasted by the fall of the Kirtland Safety Society and in declining health for several years before he passed, so it's entirely possible that the Church did support him financially for a time. But, whether true or not, I personally suspect that Joseph being their family member had a lot more to do with them supporting his calling as a prophet than anything else did.

*Emma was present [at the sealing of Emily and Eliza]. She gave her free and full consent.

My sister Eliza found a home with the family of Brother Joseph Coolidge, and I went to live with Sister Sylvia Lyons. She was a good woman, and one of the Lord's chosen few.*

Emma's hurt and anger over plural marriage are well known. There are multiple stories of her losing her temper and causing scenes and even physical harm to others. These stories led to a strong resentment against her from the Saints who crossed the plains to Utah, which unfortunately lasted for generations. I've noticed a shift in attitude toward her even in my lifetime, which means it hung on for 150 years.

I have a lot of respect and admiration for Emma Smith, and I don't want to spread gossip or add any fuel to the fire against her. I think it's perfectly understandable that she grappled with the principle of plural marriage. I can't imagine being asked to live that law on top of everything else she'd gone through because of Joseph's calling. It would probably be the most difficult thing any of us were ever asked to do. But I do need to discuss some of those stories because they provide important context for Joseph's behavior in these instances I'm covering today.",3

To Latter-day Saints around the world, Emma is the most famous woman in the Church. She was the first to know that Joseph received the gold plates from the angel Moroni. She was the only woman to serve as a scribe for the Book of Mormon translation. Of her role as scribe Emma said,

>
> My belief is that the Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity—I have not the slightest doubt of it. I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscript unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe [he] would dictate to me hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he could at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him. This was an unusual thing for him to do. It would have been improbable that a learned man could do this; and, for one so ignorant and unlearned as he was[,] it was simply impossible.3

Even once they arrived, they didn't have peace. The US government sent the army out to eradicate them. They were mocked and insulted all over the world. They had their rights to due process and to have representation in government taken from them. The female right to vote was rescinded in their territory. The government seized their property and refused Latter-day Saint immigrants entry into the country. Apostles were murdered. Etc.

The Saints in Utah territory did not have an easy time for well over half a century, sacrificing all that they had to live the commandment of plural marriage. During that time, they believed that Emma was living a very easy life back in Nauvoo because she denied its existence and kept their property for herself. They resented her for that, and unfortunately, it came out in the form of malicious gossip.

They were wrong, just like she was wrong in thinking *they* had the bulk of Joseph's property with them. But that means that it's difficult today to tell which of the later accounts are true and which are false.

From these accounts, however, I think it's clear why Joseph tried to hide some of his plural marriages from Emma. She was very hurt and upset by them, they caused a lot of strife and acrimony in *their* marriage, and she struggled to accept the doctrine. He didn't want to cause her pain, and he didn't want to start any more arguments when their marriage was already in a precarious position. But at the same time, he had to obey God. He had to be sealed to the women he was commanded to be sealed to. It maybe wasn't the *best*decision he could have made, but I don't blame him for making it. And I don't blame her for feeling the way she did about it all.

Emma initially refused to join any group vying for leadership of the Church. In the months following Joseph's martyrdom, Brigham Young and the Quorum of the Twelve emerged as the most prominent leaders of the Church, especially because Joseph had rolled the authority of leadership onto the Twelve three months before his death.6: 5–19.

After Joseph Smith's death in 1844, Emma remained in Nauvoo for the rest of her life rather than traveling on with the Saints, and for several years she did not associate herself with any of the groups linked to the Restoration. Why did Emma stay in Nauvoo after Joseph's death?

Have they taken you from me at last!""2, 197."") At the time of Joseph's death, Emma was pregnant with their last child and left to care for four young children alone. Going anywhere would have been extremely difficult.

She shared the Nauvoo House, her final home, with relatives and friends and basked in the love and care of her children and grandchildren. She continued to live her life with genteel qualities, meeting adversity and difficulty with grace and equanimity. She was polite to the ""Utah Mormons"" who occasionally visited, but was firm in her decision to remain apart from them.

Though Emma was publicly criticized by Church leaders for her failure to remain faithful to her husband's mission, she was sympathetically remembered by some of her former Nauvoo friends. Many of them, unlike Emma, had found the courage to accept the doctrine of plural marriage. ""I know it was hard for Emma, and any woman to enter plural marriage in those days,"" wrote Emily Partridge Young, a plural wife, ""and I do not know as anybody would have done any better than Emma did under the circumstances"" (*Woman's Exponent* 12 [Apr. 1, 1884]:165).

In 1892 at the jubilee celebration in Salt Lake City of the founding of the Nauvoo Relief Society, a motion to hang a life-size portrait of Emma Smith in the Tabernacle brought mixed responses from the Relief Society board members. To settle the question, Relief Society president Zina D. H. Young took the matter to Church President Wilford Woodruff, who replied that ""anyone who opposed it [hanging the portrait in the Tabernacle] must be very narrow minded indeed"" (Emmeline B. Wells Diary, March 11, 1892, HDC). Fifty years had softened bitter memories, and Emma Smith could once again be honored as a leader of women and remembered for the essential part she had played in the restoration of the gospel and the support she gave her Prophet-husband through the difficult years of his ministry.",2

At different times during the history of the Church, Emma has been both vilified and venerated. Rather than casting her in either of these simplified ways, it is best to embrace the complexity surrounding Emma Smith. During her marriage to Joseph she endured immense adversity and persecution. Understandably, she struggled with the introduction and practice of plural marriage (see Doctrine and Covenants 132). She chose not to join the Saints in their westward exodus but remained a faithful witness to the early history of the Church, especially the miraculous coming forth of the Book of Mormon. She was a flawed, struggling human being who endured and overcame her trials through the strength of her faith.

The persecutions she endured inflicted trauma that remained with her to the end of her life. According to one visitor who spoke to her later in her life, Emma remarked, ""I have always avoided talking to my children about having anything to do in the church, for I have suffered so much I have dreaded to have them take any part in it"" (cited in Newell and Avery, *Mormon Enigma,* 1984, 269). At the same time, what Emma did endure endeared her to those around her. Lucy Mack Smith, speaking of Emma's courage, remarked, ""I have never seen a woman in my life, who would endure every species of fatigue and hardship, from month to month, and from year to year, with that unflinching courage, zeal and patience, which she has always done; for I know that which she has had to endure; that she has been tossed upon the ocean of uncertainty; that She has breasted the storm of persecution, and buffeted the rage of men and devils, until she has been swallowed up in a sea of trouble which have borne down almost any other woman"" (Lucy Mack Smith, History, 1845, 190, JSP).",2

In these various capacities, she was both an active participant and an intimate witness of the miraculous events as they unfolded.

You know, Jenny, you've probably done as much research on Emma Smith as anyone alive today. My question for you is how do you feel about Emma, the woman, a daughter of God, based on that history and that research that you've done?

You know, I think I want to step back just a little bit. I think she really agreed with Joseph in expanding her house and welcoming people into it, I think the trouble arose when John C. Bennett who had been a confidant of Joseph Smith, started using the idea of spiritual wifery to manipulate young women into sexual encounters that Joseph did not in any way suggest or – or approve, and I think once that gossip started going around, and it certainly came back to Emma, it's this whole idea of marital relationships expanding beyond her own was really hurtful to her. I think she felt betrayed and I think one of the reasons she felt betrayed was because she did not know about some of the marriages that Joseph had been engaged in and some of them were her really good friends. Eliza R. Snow was the secretary of the Relief Society, Sarah Cleveland was the first counselor in the Relief Society, whose husband was not a member of the Church. Elizabeth Ann Whitney's daughter was sealed to Joseph Smith and all of these things did not – were not made known and I think Joseph gets called out for that in this section.
Now Joseph is very concerned about adultery, as we are today. And so as we see in verses 40 through 44, some rules and commandments that the Lord gives about forgiving adultery, and this is exactly what John C. Bennett was doing. In fact, he was committing unadulterated adultery.",3

Harper,5,"It wasn't only Emma's confirmation that had been interrupted. Choosing to marry Joseph had disrupted the trajectory of Emma's life. As with so many women who came of age in her time and place, Emma was raised to aspire to middle-class respectability. Given her tumultuous married life thus far, she couldn't help but be concerned about her financial future.

Then in section 24 the Lord essentially guaranteed Joseph and Emma a modest living if the Saints would support them. They would have enough to enable him to devote his life to the Church but no guarantee of things of this world. All section 24 seemed to assure Emma was a life of hardship with a husband who belonged to the Church.

Up to that point, the Lord had only spoken to the men of the Church, though, like Emma, the women of the Church—Lucy Mack Smith, Mary Whitmer, Polly Knight, and many others—were just as much its backbone and as vital as a heartbeat. Then the Lord let Emma know that he could see through her eyes and gave her an opportunity to see through his.

The earliest manuscript of section 25 begins more intimately than the more formal, published version. ""Emma my daughter in Zion,"" the Lord says, ""A Revelation I give unto you concerning my will Behold thy sins are for given thee & thou art an Elect Lady whom I have called.""2 He reveals his will to this highly favored daughter, promising to preserve her life and place in Zion if she will be faithful and virtuous. This was no hollow promise to a woman living in a time of high maternal mortality rates who had nearly died shortly after her first child did.",2

It is also improper to speculate about Emma's salvation. An incident told by Emma's nurse, Elizabeth Revel, illustrates Emma's relationship with God near the end of her life. According to Revel, a few days before Emma's death,

>
> Joseph came to her in a vision and said, ""Emma, come with me, it is time for you to come with me."" As Emma related it, she said, ""I put on my bonnet and my shawl and went with him; I did not think that it was anything unusual. I went with him into a mansion, and he showed me through the different apartments of that beautiful mansion."" And one room was the nursery. In that nursery was a babe in the cradle. She said, ""I knew my babe, my Don Carlos that was taken from me."" She sprang forward, caught the child up in her arms, and wept with joy over the child. When Emma recovered herself sufficient[,] she turned to Joseph and said, ""Joseph, where are the rest of my children."" He said to her, ""Emma, be patient and you shall have all of your children.""

A month after entering baptismal waters, the Prophet Joseph received a revelation for Emma in which she was told, ""Behold, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou art an elect lady, whom I have called"" (D&C 25:3).

Emma became the mother of eleven children, raising five to adulthood. With two babies in her arms and two children at her skirts, she walked across the frozen Mississippi River to safety in Quincy, Illinois, carrying Joseph Smith's papers, which included the new translation of the Bible. ""No one but God, knows the reflections of my mind and the feelings of my heart when I left our house and home, and almost all of everything that we possessed [in Missouri] except our little children,"" wrote Emma to Joseph, a prisoner in Liberty Jail.4

Emma welcomed the poor and the acclaimed into her home, compiled two hymnbooks, and became president of the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo. Under her able guidance, women of Nauvoo ministered to the needs of the poor. Through their charitable efforts, heavy burdens were lifted and necessities needed to sustain life were freely given.

Emma participated in temple ordinance work, acting as a proxy for her extended family members. She wrote letters in defense of the Prophet Joseph to the governor of Illinois, and traveled about fifty miles to Quincy, Illinois to meet with him. She cared for Lucy Mack Smith in her old age and maintained properties in Nauvoo significant to the life of Joseph Smith. She bore a continuing testimony, even in her seventy-fourth year, of Joseph's prophetic calling: ""I believe he was everything he professed to be.""5 Emma died in April 1879 in Nauvoo at age 74.",2

I believe it, and I don't think that's the sort of vision that a person that is gonna be in trouble in the next life has.

When you heard the scripture I just recited, you heard the words of Christ. I testify that is true. Jesus Christ speaks the words of the Father. You can read the scriptures, listen, and then hear God's answers to you.

There is another way to listen to God. Many of you will have heard answers to your prayers today. I bear testimony that you have in this conference heard the voices of Apostles and prophets of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord said this of them, as they speak by his direction:

""What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.

""For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, and the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever. Amen."" (D&C 1:38–39.)

It is the Spirit which will bear record to your heart as you read the scriptures, as you hear the Lord's authorized servants, and as God speaks directly to your heart. You can listen and hear if you believe that the scriptures are accurate when they describe the Holy Ghost this way:

""Yea, thus saith the still small voice, which whispereth through and pierceth all things, and often times it maketh my bones to quake while it maketh manifest."" (D&C 85:6.)

Now, I testify it is a small voice. It whispers, not shouts. And so you must be very quiet inside. That is why you may wisely fast when you want to listen. And that is why you will listen best when you feel, ""Father, thy will, not mine, be done."" You will have a feeling of ""I want what you want."" Then, the still small voice will seem as if it pierces you. It may make your bones to quake. More often it will make your heart burn within you, again softly, but with a burning which will lift and reassure.",1

And today He teaches you and me to pray as we see Him in our minds praying in Gethsemane and saying, ""Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done"" (Luke 22:42). When you pray, do you really, truly want that ""not my will, but thine, be done""?

Paul describes how Jesus prayed ""in the days of his flesh,"" especially in Gethsemane: ""When he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared"" (Hebrews 5:7). When you pray, are you really praying or just saying prayers? Are you superficial with your prayers?

Jesus prayed intensely and spoke with His Father. ""It came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened"" (Luke 3:21). When you pray, do you feel like heaven is opened? When was the last time you felt that connection with heaven?

Jesus prepared Himself to make important decisions by praying to His Father.

""He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.

""And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve"" (Luke 6:12–13).

Do you prepare yourself to make important decisions by praying to your Heavenly Father? Do you prepare yourself for a moment of prayer?",3

I gave that challenge because I had already accepted it myself. I read and underlined *every* verse cited about Jesus Christ, as listed under the main heading and the 57 subtitles in the Topical Guide.11 When I finished that exciting exercise, my wife asked me what impact it had on me. I told her, ""I am a different man!""

I felt a renewed devotion to Him as I read again in the Book of Mormon the Savior's own statement about His mission in mortality. He declared:

""I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.

""And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross.""12

As Latter-day Saints, we refer to His mission as the Atonement of Jesus Christ, which made resurrection a reality for all and made eternal life possible for those who repent of their sins and receive and keep essential ordinances and covenants.

It is doctrinally incomplete to speak of the Lord's atoning sacrifice by shortcut phrases, such as ""the Atonement"" or ""the enabling power of the Atonement"" or ""applying the Atonement"" or ""being strengthened by the Atonement."" These expressions present a real risk of misdirecting faith by treating the *event* as if *it* had living existence and capabilities independent of our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.",3

This faithful, focused woman needed to stretch as far as she could to access His power. Her physical stretching was symbolic of her spiritual stretching.

Many of us have cried out from the depths of our hearts a variation of this woman's words: ""If I could spiritually stretch enough to draw the Savior's power into my life, I would know how to handle my heart-wrenching situation. I would know what to do. And I would have the power to do it.""

When you reach up for the Lord's power in your life with the same intensity that a drowning person has when grasping and gasping for air, power from Jesus Christ will be yours. When the Savior knows you truly want to reach up to Him—when He can feel that the greatest desire of your heart is to draw His power into your life—you will be led by the Holy Ghost to know exactly what you should do.21

When you spiritually stretch beyond anything you have ever done before, then His power will flow into you.22 And then you will understand the deep meaning of words we sing in the hymn ""The Spirit of God"":

The Lord is extending the Saints' understanding. …

The knowledge and power of God are expanding;

The veil o'er the earth is beginning to burst.23

The gospel of Jesus Christ is filled with His power, which is available to every earnestly seeking daughter or son of God. It is my testimony that when we draw His power into our lives, both He and we will rejoice.24

As one of His special witnesses, I declare that God lives! Jesus is the Christ! His Church has been restored to the earth! God's prophet upon the earth today is President Thomas S. Monson, whom I sustain with all my heart. I so testify, with my expression of love and blessing for each of you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",3

There is no amorphous entity called ""the Atonement"" upon which we may call for succor, healing, forgiveness, or power. Jesus Christ is the source. Sacred terms such as *Atonement* and *Resurrection* describe what the Savior did, according to the Father's plan, so that we may live with hope in this life and gain eternal life in the world to come.

The lyrics go something like this:

When Christmas morning gleams

I want to go to the stable,

Where God in the nighttime hours

Already rests upon the straw.

How good Thou wast to desire

To come down to the earth!

Now, I do not wish to waste

My childhood days in sin anymore!

Jesus, we need Thee,

Thou dear children's friend.

I no longer wish to grieve Thee

With my sins again.10

When we figuratively transport ourselves to the Bethlehem stable, ""where God in the nighttime hours already rests upon the straw,"" we can recognize better the Savior as a gift from a kind, loving Heavenly Father. Rather than feeling entitled to His blessings and grace, we develop an intense desire to stop causing God further grief.

Whatever our current direction or distance to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, we can choose to turn toward Them and draw closer to Them. They will help us. As the Savior told the Nephites following His Resurrection:

""And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, …

""And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me.""11

To draw closer to the Savior, we must increase our faith in Him, make and keep covenants, and have the Holy Ghost with us. We must also act in faith, responding to the spiritual direction we receive. All of these elements come together in the sacrament. Indeed, the best way I know of to draw closer to God is to prepare conscientiously and partake worthily of the sacrament each week.",1

My God hath been my support"" (2 Ne. 4:19–20).

We remember Alma's counsel: ""Let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever. Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings"" (Alma 37:36–37).

""Remember, remember,"" said Helaman, ""that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, … that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, … [they] shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery"" (Hel. 5:12).

Nephi said, the Lord ""hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh"" (2 Ne. 4:21). Those who are consumed in Christ ""are made alive in Christ"" (2 Ne. 25:25). They ""suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ"" (Alma 31:38). They are ""clasped in the arms of Jesus"" (Morm. 5:11). Nephi said, ""I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul"" (2 Ne. 33:6). Lehi said, ""I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his love"" (2 Ne. 1:15).

Now, my beloved brethren and sisters, let us read the Book of Mormon and be convinced that Jesus is the Christ. Let us continually reread the Book of Mormon so that we might more fully come to Christ, be committed to Him, centered in Him, and consumed in Him.

We are meeting the adversary every day. The challenges of this era will rival any of the past, and these challenges will increase both spiritually and temporally. We must be close to Christ, we must daily take His name upon us, always remember Him, and keep His commandments.",2

(""Jesus Christ—Gifts and Expectations,"" in *Speeches of the Year, 1974,* Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1975, p. 313.)

While what President Benson said will be true in the future, we need to feel now that God knows us and loves us as individuals. There are times you have felt the closeness of God, your Father, and that you are his child. Those times can come more often. There is a simple way to think about it.

If you want to stay close to someone who has been dear to you, but from whom you are separated, you know how to do it. You would find a way to speak to them, you would listen to them, and you would discover ways to do things for each other. The more often that happened, the longer it went on, the deeper would be the bond of affection. If much time passed without the speaking, the listening, and the doing, the bond would weaken.

God is perfect and omnipotent, and you and I are mortal. But he is our Father, he loves us, and he offers the same opportunity to draw closer to him as would a loving friend. And you will do it in much the same way: speaking, listening, and doing.

There is another way you and I have felt Him grow closer to us. As we give devoted service to Him, He draws closer to those we love in our families.

He prepared loving servants of His and opportunities to draw my family closer to Him.

You have felt that same blessing in your lives. Many of you have loved ones who are wandering off the path to eternal life. You wonder what more you can do to bring them back. You can depend on the Lord to draw closer to them as you serve Him in faith.

But even with the increasing worldly influences around us, we need not fear. The Lord will never desert His covenant people. There is a compensatory power of spiritual gifts and divine direction for the righteous.12 This added blessing of spiritual power, however, does not settle upon us just because we are part of this generation. It comes as we strengthen our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and keep His commandments, as we come to know Him and love Him. ""This is life eternal,"" Jesus prayed, ""that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.""13

As we know very well, having faith in Jesus Christ and being a true disciple is more than a one-time decision—more than a one-time event. It is a sacred, ongoing process that grows and expands through the seasons of our lives, continuing until we kneel at His feet.

With the wheat growing amidst the tares in the world, how can we deepen and strengthen our commitment to the Savior in the days ahead?

Here are three thoughts:",1

We want to be encircled in the arms of our Heavenly Father's love and guidance, and so we put His will first and with a broken heart plead that Christ will pour streams of cleansing water into our pitcher. At first it may come drop by drop, but as we seek, ask, and obey, it will come abundantly. This living water will begin to fill us, and brimming with His love, we can tip the pitcher of our soul and share its contents with others who thirst for healing, hope, and belonging. As our inner pitcher becomes clean, our earthly relationships begin to heal.

Sacrifice of our personal agendas is required to make room for the eternal plans of God. The Savior, who speaks for the Father, pleads with us, ""Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you.""7 Drawing near unto the Father can mean learning of His truth through the scriptures, following prophetic counsel, and striving to do His will more completely.",3

The scriptures give scores of examples and avenues. You are well acquainted with the most basic ones. The easiest and the earliest comes simply with the desire of our heart, the most basic form of faith that we know. ""If ye can no more than *desire* to believe,"" Alma says, exercising just ""a *particle* of faith,"" giving even a *small place* for the promises of God to find a home—that is enough to begin.7 Just believing, just having a ""molecule"" of faith—simply hoping for things which are not yet seen in our lives, but which are nevertheless truly there to be bestowed8—that simple step, when focused on the Lord Jesus Christ, has ever been and always will be the first principle of His eternal gospel, the first step out of despair.

Second, we must change anything we can change that may be part of the problem. In short we must repent, perhaps the most hopeful and encouraging word in the Christian vocabulary. We thank our Father in Heaven we are *allowed* to change, we thank Jesus we *can* change, and ultimately we do so only with Their divine assistance. Certainly not everything we struggle with is a result of our actions. Often it is the result of the actions of others or just the mortal events of life. But anything *we* can change we *should* change, and we must forgive the rest. In this way our access to the Savior's Atonement becomes as unimpeded as we, with our imperfections, can make it. He will take it from there.",3

Then the Lord will bless us to be more sensitive to speak to those souls which He has prepared for us.

*Third, act at a time when you feel the Spirit.* Elder M. Russell Ballard taught us: ""The key to success in bringing souls unto Christ is to act at a time when you feel the Spirit and you sense that your friend does also. … Through our faith, our trust in the Lord, and our good works, we can bring many souls unto the Lord.""16

President Gordon B. Hinckley declared that ""[Jesus Christ] is the pivotal figure of our theology and our faith. Every Latter-day Saint has the responsibility to know … with a certainty beyond doubt that Jesus is the resurrected, living Son of the living God"" (""'Fear Not to Do Good,'"" *Ensign,* May 1983, 80).

The admonition to ""come unto Christ"" is the hub around which everything in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and thus the Relief Society, revolves—and for good reason. The verb *come* implies action on *our* part. In the familiar New Testament passage about the hereafter in which many plead their case with the Lord by listing all of their good deeds, Christ responds, ""I never knew you"" (Matt. 7:23). Joseph Smith's inspired translation of that same passage, however, notes a profound distinction—""*[You]* never knew me"" (JST, Matt. 7:33; emphasis added)—placing responsibility for coming unto the Savior squarely upon our shoulders. Jesus Christ Himself has promised, ""Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you"" (D&C 88:63).

There are no disclaimers or exceptions in His invitation. *We* are the ones who determine whether or not we will come unto Him. The drawing near, seeking, asking, and knocking are up to us. And the more we know about the Lord—meaning the more we experience His mercy, devotion, and willingness to guide us even when we may not feel worthy of His direction—the more confident we become that He *will* respond to our petitions.

As we increase our interaction with Him, we learn for ourselves that He will never betray us, never turn away, never change His criteria for coming unto Him. His attention is riveted on us, His brothers and sisters.",1

If we take upon us the name of Christ, act with faith in Him to repent of our sins, keep His commandments, and always remember Him, we will receive the companionship of the Holy Ghost through the mercy and grace of Jesus Christ.

Simple obedience brings the Spirit into our hearts. In our homes, we pray in faith, search the scriptures, and keep the Sabbath day holy. In our chapels, we partake of the sacrament and make sacred promises to our Heavenly Father in the name of Christ. In holy temples, we participate in sacred ordinances on behalf of our brothers and sisters on the other side of the veil.

Understanding the admonition to be like Him is good, but that understanding needs to be coupled with a yearning to transform ourselves, one step at a time, beyond the natural man.7 To develop the desire, we must know who Jesus Christ is. We must know something of His character,8 and we must look for His attributes in scripture, worship services, and other holy places. As we begin to know more of Him, we will see His attributes reflected in others. This will encourage us on our own quest, for if others can attain in some measure His attributes, so can we.

If we are honest with ourselves, the Light of Christ9 within us whispers that there is distance between where we are in comparison with the desired character of the Savior.10 Such honesty is vital if we are to progress in becoming like Him. Indeed, honesty is one of His attributes.

Now, those of us who are brave might consider asking a trusted family member, spouse, friend, or spiritual leader what attribute of Jesus Christ we are in need of—and we may need to brace ourselves for the response! Sometimes we see ourselves with distorted fun-house mirrors that show us either much more round or much more lean than we really are.

Trusted friends and family can help us see ourselves more accurately, but even they, as loving and helpful as they would like to be, can see things imperfectly. As a result, it is vital that we also ask our loving Heavenly Father what we are in need of and where we should focus our efforts. He has a perfect view of us and will lovingly show us our weakness.11 Perhaps you will learn that you need greater patience, humility, charity, love, hope, diligence, or obedience, to name a few.12",3

Members of this Church are entitled to, and many receive, a spiritual witness and make sacred covenants to follow the Lord. Yet despite that, some move toward Him while others do not. In which category are you?

God should be the center of our universe—our literal focal point. Is He? Or is He sometimes far from the thoughts and intents of our hearts? (see Mosiah 5:13). Notice that it's not just the thoughts of our hearts that are important but the ""intents."" How do our behavior and actions reflect the integrity of our intents?",2

This is His Church. We take His name upon us as we enter His kingdom. He is God, the Creator, and perfect. We are mortals subject to death and sin.

Here are His words: ""Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.""1

At this Easter season we are reminded of why we love Him and of the promise He makes to His faithful disciples to become His beloved friends. The Savior made that promise and told us how, in our service to Him, He comes to us. One example is in a revelation to Oliver Cowdery as he served the Lord with the Prophet Joseph Smith in the translation of the Book of Mormon: ""Behold, thou art Oliver, and I have spoken unto thee because of thy desires; therefore treasure up these words in thy heart. Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love.""2

I experienced the joy of coming closer to the Savior and of His coming closer to me most often through simple acts of obedience to the commandments.

You have had such experiences. It may have been when you chose to attend a sacrament meeting. It was for me on a Sabbath when I was very young. In those days we received the sacrament during an evening meeting. The memory of one day more than 65 years ago, when I kept the commandment to gather with my family and with the Saints, still draws me closer to the Savior.

It was dark and cold outside. I remember feeling light and warmth in the chapel that evening with my parents. We partook of the sacrament, administered by Aaronic Priesthood holders, covenanting with our Heavenly Father to always remember His Son and keep His commandments.",3

We learn through the scriptures that those who wish to take their cross upon themselves love Jesus Christ in such a way that they deny themselves of all ungodliness and of every worldly lust and keep His commandments.9

Our determination to cast off all that is contrary to God's will and to sacrifice all we are asked to give and to strive to follow His teachings will help us to endure in the path of Jesus Christ's gospel—even in the face of tribulation, the weakness of our souls, or the social pressure and worldly philosophies that oppose His teachings.

For example, for those who have not yet found an eternal companion and may be feeling lonely and hopeless, or for those who have been divorced and feel abandoned and forgotten, I assure you that accepting the Savior's invitation of taking upon yourselves your crosses and following Him means continuing with faith on the Lord's path, maintaining a pattern of dignity, and not indulging in worldly habits that will eventually take away our hope in God's love and mercy.

The same principles apply to those of you who are experiencing same-gender attraction and feel discouraged and helpless. And maybe for this reason some of you are feeling that the gospel of Jesus Christ is not for you anymore. If that is the case, I want to assure you that there is always hope in God the Father and in His plan of happiness, in Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice, and in living Their loving commandments. In His perfect wisdom, power, justice, and mercy, the Lord may seal us His, that we may be brought to His presence and have everlasting salvation, if we are steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments10 and are always abounding in good works.11",2
Did Paul write the Epistle to the Hebrews?,a558004a718e7b3a01f86e1d05fd39dc4ccdca17752f660a2e7ffb32f006f98a,0.794470489,"https://eom.byu.edu/index.php?title=Hebrews,_Epistle_to_the#","Hebrews, Epistle to the",1,"Many passages in this New Testament letter have particular significance for Latter-day Saints. In general conferences of the Church, the most frequently cited scriptures from the book of Hebrews are those concerning the Godhead (Heb. 1:1-3;12:9;13:8); the obedient suffering of Jesus (Heb. 2:14-18;4:15-16;5:8-9; *see also* Atonement of Jesus Christ); the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ (Heb. 7-8); how one must be called by God in order to hold the priesthood (Heb. 5:1-4); the nature of true faith, which motivates people to righteous action (Heb. 11); going on ""unto perfection"" (Heb. 6:1); and enduring to the end (Heb. 12:4-11). These themes are essential pillars of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

The main point at the center of the epistle is that Jesus Christ is the eternal ""high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle"" of God (Heb. 8:1-2). This theme is developed throughout the epistle, showing how eternal salvation comes through the greatness, sufficiency, and supremacy of Jesus Christ. The letter was written to devoted converts from Judaism to the early Christian church, who already understood the first principles of the gospel and had received its basic ordinances (Heb. 6:1-4). Step by step, it systematically strives to persuade them ""to hold fast to their faith"" (Buchanan, p. 266), to keep the covenant, and to realize the incomparable hope and irrevocable promises given to them by God through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. With its explication of the Atonement in terms of priesthood, oaths, covenants, and temple imagery, this entire epistle resonates and harmonizes with LDS concepts and practices.",1

As a separate and distinct personage in the Godhead, he is the God of creation and the perfect revelation of godhood for all time. He is the express image of his Father, both spiritually and physically; he alone purged the sins of mankind and sits on the right hand of God the Father (Heb. 1:1-3). The Father brought the Savior (who was his ""firstbegotten"" in the premortal existence) ""into the world"" (Heb. 1:6; cf. D&C 93:21; 1 Ne. 11:18). As the firstborn, Jesus is the heir of all things (Heb. 1:2), and those who are faithful become joint-heirs with him (see Heirs).

Chapter 2 holds a strong warning to heed the word of God given through Jesus Christ (Heb. 2:1-4). The next world is in subjugation to Christ alone (Heb 2:5-10). God made him a little lower than ""the gods"" (taking the marginal reading of Ps. 8:4-6). Because God is the Father of all, even Christ is subject to him. Christ is second only to the Father, yet he is the spirit brother of mankind (Heb. 2:17). Like his brothers and sisters in mortality, he suffered temptation, but unlike them, he never sinned (Heb. 2:18;4:15-16).

We have now read all of his epistles. Imagine the book of Hebrews being what Paul—this is my imagination here—imagine this is what he would have taught people verbally when he was with them. And so when he's now not with them, and we had all those other epistles where he's trying to correct and fix contention and disorder, it's lovely that we now have what may have been a common sermon from Paul about how people can understand Jesus Christ—things that we don't typically get in other Pauline writings because he's trying to address specific issues in different words around the Mediterranean Basin who've already received this message.

And by the way, just as another side note on the Paul point. If you're Paul and you're trying to convince judaizers of the supremacy of Christ and you want to persuade people and move the needle, per se, you probably don't want to introduce yourself and you probably want to get somebody who's really good with the Greek, so that people can't tell it's you giving the message because Paul isn't the most popular. He would not have won the congeniality competitions among the judaizers. They don't exactly love Paul.

This—if you've ever been in a situation where you feel kind of giddy, you're so excited with anticipation, that's how we feel getting ready to jump into this epistle to the Hebrews. It is loaded. It is one of my favorite books in the New Testament. And let me just, let me begin with a 30,000 foot overview of what the epistle to the Hebrews is. You ready? That's it. The greater than sign. That's it. The entire book, what it's showing is that Jesus Christ is greater than or superior to everything that the recipients of this letter hold near and dear to their hearts. The Hebrews—we don't know where these people are living specifically. We don't know exactly when this epistle was written. We don't even know who specifically wrote it. It says ""The Epistle Paul the Apostle.""

But you'll notice, it's one of the longer epistles of all of them contained in the New Testament, and yet it comes after Philemon which is the shortest—Romans being the longest of Paul's Epistles—which tells us that even when the Bible was put together, there was some uncertainty as to, is this really Paul? Because it doesn't have some of the fingerprints of Paul, like his introduction at the beginning: Paul an apostle unto you. He doesn't give his name, ever, the author. However, there have been so many theories out there that maybe Luke wrote it, maybe Apollos wrote it, maybe Barnabas, or one of his other missionary companions.",2

Now, when we hear the phrase Son of God, we often think about the literal sense, which is true. But in the ancient world, in the Biblical times, the phrase Son of God was just another way of saying the legitimate king. And if you look at Mark, chapter 1, how does Jesus's gospel, how does that gospel begin? At the baptism of Jesus Christ. He comes up out of water and He hears this phrase, ""Thou art my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased."" And so Hebrews and Mark are both trying to help us see that the King of Heaven has His Son who will inherit all things, making Him greater than anything that we could put on the board.

So, he carries this idea through the—what did this Son do? He came down from Heaven and everything that was made, everything that was created was done through that Son, which we've tied into the beginnings of Mark, we're tying into the beginnings of John. You can kind of see how this whole epistle, once again, if you only had one book outside of the gospels to read, to kind of make sense of, how does this message now move forward among the Jewish group who's joining the Church? In my mind, there's nothing more all-inclusive than this epistle to the Hebrews to show all these different doctrines. Why? because it's glorifying Christ. It's putting Him at the center of every chapter. And there's an invitation to these Hebrews, wherever they may be living, whatever time period they're in, to not abandon Jesus Christ and to not let go of their covenant with Him, knowing that many of them are probably going to face severe persecution for embracing this Christian religion, this Christian faith.",0

This is more of a general epistle pushing back against judaizers and everything that they hold so sacred from the Old Testament and from the old law of Moses. This book is showing the supremacy and the majesty of Jesus Christ as being greater than all of those things.

So it turns out the first four verses give that as a very clear thesis statement. And then, it turns out, the chapters are broken up, identifying really amazing things from the Old Testament.

Latter-day Saints are interested that, in replacing Judas, one apostle was chosen to complete the Twelve and that Peter set the qualifications of apostles: They must know the ministry of Jesus, they must be ordained, and they must be witnesses of his resurrection (Acts 1:21-22). Latter-day apostles in the Church are also ""special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world"" (D&C 107:23; cf. 27:12; 84:108). In addition, the book of Acts indicates the rich outpouring of the Holy Ghost in the early Church, both in the form of guiding revelation and in manifestations of the gifts of the spirit, characteristics that Latter-day Saints experience and value. Further, certain prophetic statements have particular meaning. For example, Latter-day Saints understand Paul's prophecy to the elders of Ephesus concerning mutinous problems within the early Church to be an inspired declaration about the impending apostasy (Acts 20:29-30). Moreover, they view Peter's prediction of Jesus' return from heaven at ""the times of restitution of all things"" as commencing with the latter-day restoration of the gospel (3:19-21). Further, the book of Acts has a good deal to say about the organization, doctrines, and character of the preaching of the early Christian church.

**THE EPISTLES.** Letters in the New Testament are traditionally divided into two groups, the writings of Paul and the general epistles.

The style of Paul's writings varies from the almost formal exposition in Romans to the charming persuasion in Philemon.",2

Verse 8: ""Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered."" Did you catch it? There it is again. We talked about that back in the opening chapters, that there's something about suffering that teaches us obedience, that purges our soul, that purifies us, that somehow makes us better. Verse 9: ""And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him."" Notice ""obedience"" in verse 8 and ""obey him"" in verse 9. There's a lot more going on in this epistle than just: confess Christ, love the Lord, and you're good. That's all you need to do. There's a lot more happening here with this turning to the Lord in greater obedience.

And it's important. Sometimes in the Church we have this disease called perfectionism, where we feel like it is our job to perfect ourselves and then, once we're done, then we'll say to Jesus: Tada. I'm like you. Can I now be entered into your presence? Being made perfect or complete or whole or oriented towards a larger purpose—this word, ""perfect,"" is actually a very significant word that has lots of expansive meanings far beyond just not having sin anymore in our lives.

Chapter 5 explains how Jesus obtained his authority to act as Israel's great High Priest. He did not presume to take this honor upon himself. As with Aaron, God chose him and bestowed authority upon him as ""a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec"" (Heb. 5:6; Ps. 110:4).",0

Gal. 2-3; Rom. 2-5). Early on, Paul had taught his gentile converts that they did not need to live the Law of Moses in order to be justified before God. It was sufficient to make and keep the gospel covenant, the covenant of faith, to do this, while outward observance of the Law of Moses was not (Gal. 2:16). In particular, after Christ's Atonement, there was no longer any necessity of observing the earlier law and covenant of Moses, which were rendered obsolete by the law and covenant of the gospel (cf. Heb. 8:6-13; 3 Ne. 9:17-20). Thus, Paul's Gentile converts did not need to become Jews in order to become Christians (cf. Acts 15:5-29), for human beings are ""justified by faith without the deeds of the law"" (Rom. 3:28). A complete commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ, the covenant of faith, automatically fulfills all previous obligations before God, including the obligations of the Law of Moses.",3

However, Paul's second letter to the Corinthians is much more difficult to outline, and many scholars point to its ""unparalleled lack of apparent structure and unity,"" especially in the beginning of the letter.2 Because of this, many scholars believe that 2 Corinthians is actually a combination of two or more letters that were put together by a later scribe or editor sometime after Paul had written them. However, as evangelical scholar Craig Blomberg has noted, many of these apparent discrepancies in the letter can be resolved when the first seven chapters are read as a large chiasm focused on the Atonement of Jesus Christ.3. For reference and discussion of Blomberg's work, see Neal Rappleye, ""Chiasmus Criteria in Review,"" in Chiasmus: The State of the Art, 292–293."")

Biblical scholars have long recognized the use of chiasmus in the ancient world, especially among ancient Israelites. Paul, having been taught in the Jewish law and having been raised as a Jew, would have likewise been familiar with this literary practice. Indeed, as John W. Welch has observed, Paul used chiasmus to various extents throughout some of his other epistles, such as Galatians and 1 Corinthians.4, 213–219. For additional examples of chiasmus in Paul's epistles, see pp. 213–229."") As such, it should be no surprise that Paul could use chiasmus in a profoundly complex and meaningful ways.",2

**BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.** Details of Paul's life are found in his letters and in the book of Acts. Born in Tarsus of Cilicia (modern southeastern Turkey), Paul was multicultural. As a Jew, he was known by the name of Saul and was educated in Jerusalem as a Pharisee under the famous rabbi Gamaliel. He was also a Roman citizen by birth, a rare privilege for a Jew at that time. Finally, he was familiar with Greek language and culture through his early environment in the Hellenistic city of Tarsus. Thus, he was able to deal with Jews, Romans, and Greeks on their own cultural terms-a great advantage for his later missionary work.",3

One of them, the Codex Vaticanus, has a little marginal note written next to Hebrews, chapter 1, verse 3, and it's fascinating. You've got the text, written in the Greek, and by the way the Greek Bibles—all of those early codices are written in capital Greek letters all slammed together with no spacing no punctuation and you get to the end of a line then you just pick up in the next line with the next letter and you just keep going. No spaces, that's how they're all written. Well out in the margin in smaller text—you can Google this image, the Codex Vaticanus marginal note—it says in the Greek, ""Fool and knave, leave the old reading and do not change it!""

That's a verse that is very prone to be reworked, rewritten for an editor or a copier 100 years down the road, 200, 300 years down the road, say: Oh, I don't like this. I'm going to change the wording here to match my doctrine or my theology a little better. It's fascinating to me, the fact that a manuscript copier, sometime in the early years of the existence of the Bible, would write that marginal note implies that that copier or that manuscript writer has watched other people or other scripts get changed, especially with reference to the Godhead in other settings, and he's saying: fool and knave, leave this verse alone, don't change it.

They believe that God is a spirit and that the Godhead is only one God. In our view, these concepts are evidence of the falling away we call the Great Apostasy.

We maintain that the concepts identified by such nonscriptural terms as ""the incomprehensible mystery of God"" and ""the mystery of the Holy Trinity"" are attributable to the ideas of Greek philosophy. These philosophical concepts transformed Christianity in the first few centuries following the deaths of the Apostles. For example, philosophers then maintained that physical matter was evil and that God was a spirit without feelings or passions. Persons of this persuasion, including learned men who became influential converts to Christianity, had a hard time accepting the simple teachings of early Christianity: an Only Begotten Son who said he was in the express image of his Father in Heaven and who taught his followers to be one as he and his Father were one, and a Messiah who died on a cross and later appeared to his followers as a resurrected being with flesh and bones.

The collision between the speculative world of Greek philosophy and the simple, literal faith and practice of the earliest Christians produced sharp contentions that threatened to widen political divisions in the fragmenting Roman empire. This led Emperor Constantine to convene the first churchwide council in a.d. 325. The action of this council of Nicaea remains the most important single event after the death of the Apostles in formulating the modern Christian concept of deity.

Their work was to bring all men to a ""unity of the faith"" regarding Jesus Christ and His teachings (Eph. 4:13).
3. **The Church of Christ and many simple truths were lost.**

Several Bible prophets declared that there would be a ""falling away"" (2 Thes. 2:3) from the true gospel, a time when there would be a ""famine"" (Amos 8:11) regarding the word of God, and ""divisions"" (1 Cor. 11:18) caused as ""grievous wolves"" (Acts 20:29) would enter and disrupt the flock or the people of the Church. These prophecies became a reality when in the years following the Savior's crucifixion, the Apostles were killed, the authority to direct the Church was eventually lost, and for many centuries, including the period known as the Dark Ages, the Church of Jesus Christ was not found on the earth.
4. **The hearts of men and a location were prepared for a restoration of the gospel.**

The closing of the Dark Ages took place as the Reformation unfolded, where brave men and women recognized the need to incorporate doctrines that Jesus had instituted back into the church. We are grateful for the great reformers such as Luther, Wycliffe, Wesley, Tyndale, and many others who helped set the stage for open religious dialogue, study of the scriptures, and the desire engendered in the hearts of good men and women for an expression of religious liberty.

In apparent dismay, Jesus turned to the Twelve and asked, ""Will ye also go away?""

Then it was that Simon Peter replied, ""Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.""

Note if you will that the words of eternal life were *not* with those who fell away, but rather with those who remained faithful and loyal.

Subsequently, during the administration of the Twelve, serious apostasy developed again. As a result, nearly all of the epistles of the New Testament were written to combat it.

While the Ephesian Saints were no stranger to persecution from the Greco-Roman world (see Acts 19:24–41), of much greater concern to Paul was that the Ephesian Saints remain loyal to the Lord and their covenants. Moreover, much of Paul's epistles were written in part to correct false beliefs and attitudes that were arising in the various churches, just as he had foretold.5

Shortly before he was executed under Nero's command, Paul warned Timothy that the prophesied rebellion was then at hand, as many churches Paul established had forsaken him and the gospel: ""All they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes"" (2 Timothy 1:15). This rebellion even reached some of Paul's most trusted missionary companions: ""Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me"" (2 Timothy 4:10–11).",0

While this may appear to be a bold claim, closer review of the New Testament shows that the Apostles knew of the forthcoming Apostasy and warned the Church extensively against the false teachers that would come in its wake.

The word *apostasy* comes from the Greek word *apostasia*, which literally means ""rebellion"" and in the New Testament connotes a people rebelling from God.1, 133–134."") However, the meaning of this word is unfortunately often masked in translations into English. For example, the King James Version of 2 Thessalonians 2:3 translates *apostasia* as ""falling away"": ""Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.""2 While not always clear in translations of the Bible, the connotation of *apostasy* as a rebellion against God is clearly described in the Book of Mormon (see 3 Nephi 6:18; 4 Nephi 1:38).

Noel B. Reynolds has noted that in light of the evidence from the New Testament and based on the meaning of *apostasy* as ""rebellion,"" it is a myth that ""the apostasy happened because of outside persecution.""3 Rather, the New Testament consistently describes the forthcoming Apostasy as an internal rebellion by members of the early Church against God and His chosen leaders—a rebellion that became more and more prominent as the Apostles wrote earnestly in hopes that the congregations might repent.4",3

The rise of revelatory communities, apostasies, and restorations has happened cyclically throughout the history of mankind, in a series of dispensations from the time of Adam and Enoch (Moses 7) to the present. Latter-day Saints see a historical ""great apostasy"" and subsequent loss of authority beginning in the New Testament era and spreading in the centuries immediately following that era. Though Latter-day Saints have not emphasized the great apostasy as much as they have the concept that the Church is a revelatory restoration, the need of a restoration implies that something important was lost after the departure of the primitive Christian church.

The English word ""apostasy"" derives from the Greek *apostasía* or *apóstasis* (""defection, revolt""; used in a political sense by Herodotus and Thucydides); it is mentioned in a religious context in the Septuagint and the New Testament (e.g., Josh. 22:22 and 2Chr. 29:19; 2 Thes. 2:3states that an *apostasía* must come before the second coming of Christ). It can mean the intransitive ""to stand away from,"" or the active ""to cause to stand away from."" Thus an apostasy can be an active, collective rebellion or a ""falling away.""",2

This time the people turned against Christ and His Apostles. The collapse was so great we have come to know it as the Great Apostasy, which led to the centuries of spiritual stagnation and ignorance called the Dark Ages.

Now, I need to be very clear about these historically reoccurring periods of apostasy and spiritual darkness. Our Heavenly Father loves all of His children, and He wants them all to have the blessings of the gospel in their lives. Spiritual light is not lost because God turns His back on His children. Rather, spiritual darkness results when His children turn their collective backs on Him. It is a natural consequence of bad choices made by individuals, communities, countries, and entire civilizations. This has been proven again and again throughout the course of time. One of the great lessons of this historical pattern is that our choices, both individually and collectively, do result in spiritual consequences for ourselves and for our posterity.

In every dispensation, God's loving desire to bless His children is manifest in the miraculous restoration of the gospel truth to the earth through living prophets. The Restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith in the early 1800s is only the most recent example. Similar restorations were accomplished in earlier times through such prophets as Noah, Abraham, Moses, and, of course, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.",3

Apostolic authority ceased just after the New Testament period, and without apostolic leadership and authority the Church was soon overwhelmed by alien intellectual and cultural pressures. The simple affirmations of biblical faith were turned into the complex propositions of theology. Though subsequent churches were still ""Christian,"" in the LDS view they no longer possessed the *fulness* of the gospel of Jesus Christ or apostolic authority. Latter-day Saints would agree with Catholics and ""high church"" Protestants that apostolic authority is essential in the true church but would also agree with other Protestants that apostolic authority was lacking in medieval orthodoxy. A close parallel is presented by Protestant rejection of Roman Catholic claims to binding apostolic authority. While Latter-day Saints trace the Apostasy to roughly the second century and reject subsequent orthodoxy, most Protestants would place it somewhere nearer the fifteenth century and then reject subsequent Catholicism.

Protestants who denied the necessity of apostolic succession, or who did not believe its links were severed by the Reformation, generally held that the fulness of the gospel could be achieved by reforming the Roman Church. Latter-day Saints, who insist on the necessity of apostolic succession but believe its links were severed early, see a reformation as inadequate for recovering the fulness of the gospel and reestablishing original Christianity. Only a total restoration of apostolic doctrines and authority could reestablish the pure Christianity of the first century.

To be faithful is to keep covenant; to apostatize is to break covenant.""8 Furthermore, in the Greek Septuagint the word *apostasia* is used to describe idolatry and forsaking the Lord. Similarly, the same word is used to describe divorce, especially when marriage was used as a metaphor for God's covenant with Israel. Early Christian texts similarly describe the Apostasy as a corruption of priesthood leaders and a rejection of ordinances and covenants.9 As such, apostasy marks the loss of covenants and priesthood authority that can be restored only through a prophet of God.",2

The consequences persist in the various creeds of Christianity, which declare a Godhead of only one being and which describe that single being or God as ""incomprehensible"" and ""without body, parts, or passions."" One of the distinguishing features of the doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is its rejection of all of these postbiblical creeds (see Stephen E. Robinson, *Are Mormons Christians?* Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1991; *Encyclopedia of Mormonism,* ed. Daniel H. Ludlow, 4 vols., New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1992, s.v.

In the process of what we call the Apostasy, the tangible, personal God described in the Old and New Testaments was replaced by the abstract, incomprehensible deity defined by compromise with the speculative principles of Greek philosophy. The received language of the Bible remained, but the so-called ""hidden meanings"" of scriptural words were now explained in the vocabulary of a philosophy alien to their origins. In the language of that philosophy, God the Father ceased to be a Father in any but an allegorical sense. He ceased to exist as a comprehensible and compassionate being. And the separate identity of his Only Begotten Son was swallowed up in a philosophical abstraction that attempted to define a common substance and an incomprehensible relationship.",2

This restitution of all things was begun by God the Father and Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith.

As Faulconer explained, ""We cannot understand what apostasy means for New Testament Christians without understanding that it included the loss of the temple and, so, of the priesthood, for ultimately the rebellion of apostasy involves severing one's covenant relation to God, a relation manifest through the priesthood, through standing in the presence of God.""10 A serious part of the Restoration entailed restoring covenants and temples, thereby providing a corrective course to this rebellion that corrupted many early Christian doctrines and beliefs.

Talmage also chronicled the persecution of early Christians that hastened the Apostasy and described the primitive Church as changing internally in several respects. He argued that the simple principles of the gospel were mixed with the pagan philosophical systems of the day (Trinitarianism, resulting in the Nicene Creed; false opposition of body and spirit, creating excessive asceticism); that rituals were changed and added to in unauthorized ways (simple early Christian rites were replaced by complex pagan-influenced ceremonies; baptism by immersion was lost; the baptism of infants was introduced cf. [Moro. 8]; communion was changed); and that church organization was altered (the apostles and prophets, the necessary foundation of the church of Christ, were martyred, leaving a void that could not be filled by bishops; thus the medieval church showed little similarity to the organization or practices of the New Testament church).",2

In 1833, referring to Mark 16:17-18 and 1Corinthians 12, Joseph Smith stated: ""By the foregoing testimonies we may look at the Christian world and see [that] the apostasy there has been from the apostolic platform"" (*TPJS*, p. 15). Oliver Cowdery wrote on the apostasy in the first issue of the messenger and advocate (1834). In 1840 Orson Pratt spoke of ""a general and awful apostasy from the religion of the New Testament"" (*Listen to the Voice of Truth*, 1.1). He particularly emphasized a lack of binding ordinances because of the absence of priesthood authority; baptism was a key example. In Pratt's view all churches before the Restoration were wrong in some ways, doctrinally and ritually, even though they might be right in others. Benjamin Winchester, an early LDS pamphleteer, wrote an extensive treatise using New Testament sources to demonstrate that an apostasy had been prophesied (*A History of Priesthood*, Philadelphia, 1843, pp. 72-96). In the 1850s and 1860s many references were made to ""the great apostasy"" (O. Pratt, *JD* 12:247) and ""the great falling away"" (W. Woodruff, *JD* 8:262) in Latter-day Saint sermons.

This idea-breaking off from established religion because it seems out of tune with New Testament Christianity-has obvious Protestant overtones, but the LDS view differs from typical Protestant attitudes in its emphasis on the loss and restoration of exclusive, clear-cut priesthood authority, correct ordinances, and continuing revelation. In contrast, Protestants typically rely primarily on biblical reinterpretation.",1

Latter-day Saints who have seriously contravened or ignored cardinal Church teachings (publicly or privately) are considered apostates, whether or not they have officially left the Church or affiliated with another religion. By not participating in Church meetings one is not considered apostate. However, when individuals ask to have their names removed from Church records, policy requires such requests to be honored. A Church disciplinary procedure may be held for any member who violates important commandments and ""will not repent"" (Mosiah 26:32; D&C 42:28). Open repudiation of the Church, its leaders, and teachings is one ground for excommunication.

The steps to apostasy are usually gradual. All members are counseled to guard against all manifestations of personal apostasy (*DS* 3:293-312; Asay, pp. 67-68). The most frequent causes of apostasy are failure to maintain strict standards of morality, taking personal offense (real or perceived), marrying someone who is of another faith or who is irreligious, neglecting to pray and maintain spirituality, or misunderstanding of the teachings of the Church.

Apostasy may be accelerated by a faulty assumption that scripture or Church leaders are infallible. Joseph Smith taught that ""a prophet was a prophet only when he was acting as such"" (*HC* 5:265). He also declared he ""was but a man, and [people] must not expect me to be perfect"" (*HC* 5:181). Neither the Church nor its leaders and members claim infallibility.

Above all, the Church affirms that its members should seek personal revelation to know the truth and live in tune with the spirit of God. Those who have not done this may drop by the wayside when their faith is challenged or when difficulties arise.",2

In the preface to the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord clearly indicates the causes of the Apostasy. First, the people rejected the voice of the prophets and apostles. It was not only the death of the original Apostles that led to the destruction of the Church in the meridian of time but the people's refusal to heed their words. The Lord called new Apostles in the New Testament period, bringing in Matthias, Paul, Barnabas, and others to replenish the ranks of the Twelve. But as more and more of the early leaders of the Church were rejected or killed, the calling of new apostles became futile. With the people unwilling to listen to his servants, the Lord withdrew the privilege of having his servants in their midst.

The very idea of a centralized Christianity has given way to a picture of diverse and fragmented early Christianity, where it is hard to determine what is orthodox and what is heretical, what is Gnostic and what is ""mainstream."" For instance, Peter Brown and William Phipps argue that Augustine's influential doctrine of original sin, with its concomitant ritual, infant baptism, was derived from his Gnostic background and was, in reality, heretical, while Pelagius' opposition to these ideas was orthodox. But Augustine's doctrines prevailed, and continue to influence Western theology and culture. Another early Christian doctrine that did not survive in Western Christianity was deification, though it remained central to Eastern Christianity.

A complex religious and cultural milieu both nurtured and transformed early Christianity. Many factors must be taken into consideration in analyzing this transformation of Christianity. For example, some have put the blame exclusively on Greek philosophy and the influence of philosophy on Gnosticism for the rise of the great apostasy. But asceticism (i.e., hatred of the body, of sexuality, of the physical world) played a major role in the apostasy of the early church, and extreme asceticism is characteristically Oriental. Moreover, much of Greek philosophy has been found to be consistent with the gospel; Elder Orson F. Whitney referred to Plato and Socrates as ""servants of the Lord,"" although in a ""lesser sense"" than the prophets (*CR* [April 1921]:33).",1

Some interpreters have erroneously stated that Jesus's bestowal of the keys to Peter as recorded in Matthew 16:18 demonstrates that Jesus taught there could be no apostasy. However, when read in its proper context, the gates of hell refer specifically to the realms of the dead—thus, Jesus taught that the priesthood authority given to the Apostles would be instrumental in the work of salvation for the dead through proxy ordinances (see Matthew 16:19). The idea that the gates of hell referred to Satan's power and dominion (which led to the interpretation of Jesus promising the Church would not be overcome by apostasy) is a late addition to the text that would be entirely foreign to the New Testament Church. For a detailed discussion of the gates of hell in this context, see Hugh Nibley, ""Baptism for the Dead in Ancient Times,"" in Mormonism and Early Christianity (Provo, UT: FARMS; Salt Lake City, UT: Deseret Book, 1987), 105–109; see also Book of Mormon Central, ""Why Are People Baptized for the Dead?

He ate with them. He walked with them. Before His final Ascension, He commissioned them to ""go … and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.""5 The Apostles heeded that instruction. They also called upon others to help them fulfill the Lord's command.

Today, under the direction of modern apostles and prophets, that same charge has been extended to missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. These missionaries serve in more than 150 nations. As representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ, they strive to fulfill that divine command—renewed in our day by the Lord Himself—to take the fulness of the gospel abroad and bless the lives of people everywhere.6

Missionaries in their late teens or early 20s are young in ways of the world. But they are blessed with gifts—such as the power of the Holy Spirit, the love of God, and testimonies of the truth—that make them powerful ambassadors of the Lord. They share the good news of the gospel that will bring true joy and everlasting happiness to all who heed their message. And in many instances they do so in a country and a language foreign to them.

Missionaries strive to follow Jesus Christ in both word and deed. They preach of Jesus Christ and of His Atonement.7 They teach of the literal Restoration of Christ's ancient Church through the Lord's first latter-day prophet, Joseph Smith.

Members of the early Church, from the newest to the most seasoned, took part in the Savior's great commission, sharing the good news of the gospel with those they met and knew. The determination to share their testimony of Jesus Christ helped His newly established Church grow expansively.2

We too, as Christ's disciples, are invited to heed His commission today, as if we were there on that mountain in Galilee when He first proclaimed it. This commission began again in 1830, when Joseph Smith set apart his brother Samuel as an early missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ.3 Since that time, more than 1.5 million missionaries have traveled throughout the world teaching all nations and baptizing those who embrace the glad tidings of the restored gospel.

This is our doctrine. Our fond desire.

From our young children to the eldest among us, we yearn for the time when we can heed the Savior's call and share the gospel with the nations of the world. I am sure you young men and young women felt a similar empowering challenge from our prophet yesterday as he invited you to prepare for full-time missionary service just as the Savior did with His Apostles.

Like sprinters at the starting blocks, we wait with anticipation for the official invitation, complete with the prophet's signature, signaling the start of the race! This desire is noble and inspirational; however, let's consider this question: why don't we *all* begin now?

You might ask, ""How can I be a missionary without a name badge?"" Or we tell ourselves, ""The full-time missionaries are set apart to do this work. I would like to help but perhaps later when life has calmed down a bit.""

Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, after restoring his gospel in our day and establishing his Church, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, revealed through his Prophet, Joseph Smith, the following:

""Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.

""For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape.

""And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days."" (D&C 1:1–2, 4.)

Today I shall speak doctrine, by way of warning and of testimony, and shall do so as one holding the holy apostleship, whose responsibility it is to proclaim the Lord's message in all the world and to all people. Each of my brethren of the Council of the Twelve has the same responsibility I have to declare these things to the world and to bear record of them before all men.

Toward the end of his mortal ministry, the Lord commanded the Prophet Joseph Smith as follows:

""Make a solemn proclamation of my gospel … to all the kings of the world, to the four corners thereof … and to all nations of the earth."" (D&C 124:2–3.) He was to invite them to come to the light of truth, and use their means to build up the kingdom of God on earth.

In the spirit of this divine direction, on the sixth day of April 1845, and shortly after the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum had mingled their blood with that of the other martyrs of true religion, the Council of the Twelve made such a proclamation. They address it:

*""To all the Kings of the World;*

*To the President of the United States of America;*

*To the Governors of the several States;*

Rather than being lost in a big city, they were asked to move to a smaller community where they could develop their ability and where there would be more schools and a need for more schoolteachers and where people with talent would develop their ability. Out of all of this, my family were asked to leave Farmington and Tooele, to sell their green acres, and go out into southern Idaho, where there was nothing at that time but sagebrush.

In a little settlement of that kind, my mother and father fell in love. By the time they were 20 years old and ready to be married, where would they be married? In the Logan Utah Temple. How would they get there? By buggy. How long would it take? Well, five or six or seven days. Highways and good roads? Of course not. They went by roads made by wagons going over the sagebrush and through the bushes and over the rocks. Where would they be married? Where would they be sealed? Only one place—the temple.

If they wanted statehood, which they did and which Brigham felt very strongly about, they couldn't pass any anti-slavery laws.

The specific intent of the slavery laws in Utah (there were two, one for black people and one for Native Americans, passed within a month of each other) was to eventually lead to the complete elimination of slavery. Slavery in Utah was a step between the slavery of the South and indentured servitude.

There were some differences between the two laws, but basically, slaves had to come into the territory willingly and couldn't be sold or forced to move out of the territory if they didn't want to be. There were term limits on the contracts and education was required for all slaves. If masters slept with their slaves, even if it was consensual, or they neglected to feed, clothe, or shelter them, or if they abused the slaves, the contracts were null and void and the slaves were to be freed. There were also fines and potential prison sentences for the masters if they violated their contacts. There were legal recourses for the slaves and term limits imposed, which was very different from Southern slavery, and more akin to indentured servitude.

Obviously, some people abused these laws and looked for loopholes and other people were treated very badly, but the intent was to be better than those in the South and to eventually eliminate the practice from the territory.",1

Religious persecution of the 1830s and 1840s in the more populated eastern states necessitated the movement of the Latter-day Saints to the West, where they could be more isolated. The Prophet Joseph Smith had designated Jackson County, Missouri, on the fringes of civilization, as the Zion of the latter days. However, continued persecution in Ohio, in Missouri, and later in Illinois caused the Latter-day Saints to seek a refuge in the Rocky Mountains, farther to the west, where they could worship God and practice their religious beliefs in the absence of religious bigotry, in land claimed by Mexico. To approximately 80,000 LDS pioneers who gathered from many nations and traveled across the great American desert by wagons before the advent in 1869 of the railroad, and to the thousands who followed afterward, the LDS presence in the Salt Lake Valley was compared to a fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy of the latter days, the City of God, established in the top of the mountains where people from all nations could gather to the House of the Lord to learn his ways (Isa. 2:1-3). To the Latter-day pioneers, President Brigham Young's words expressed their feelings: ""This is the place.""

The seventeen-mile-wide by twenty-five-mile-long Salt Lake Valley is some 4,500 feet above sea level and is surrounded by towering mountain peaks of the Wasatch Range that rise to over 11,000 feet. The valley is part of the Great Basin, where river waters are kept from flowing into the Pacific Ocean by high mountains. Lake Bonneville once lay within the Great Basin, and geologists say that it measured 1,000 feet deep where Salt Lake City is now located. The current Great Salt Lake is the evaporation remnant of that inland sea.",3

He had the genius to have people go out and look for the valleys and the areas away from Salt Lake City where the pioneers who would pour into this valley could go and settle and make their homes and build cities and communities and build their personalities and their characters and develop the talents that would be theirs. So rather than having a large city in Salt Lake, under his leadership some 360 communities were developed out in Wyoming and Nevada and Arizona and southern Idaho as well as in Utah.

As people moved out and set up in these little communities, they developed their talents and abilities by serving on school boards and on town councils or became leading people in a little town. They became citizens of that area, and they started building schools and expanding those communities. We see what has happened in these areas that Brigham Young envisioned and which he helped set in motion. Just think of how that has developed—of the developing of a settlement, for example, in Las Vegas, Nevada, so that people could go down to San Bernardino, California. The people could come by ship into San Pedro, California, go to San Bernardino to be outfitted and helped with the equipment necessary to come into this valley, and then into the outlying communities, down into Sanpete County or up into Idaho or elsewhere.",2

Upon arriving in the city of Mesa, Arizona, we headed down an avenue at the end of which we could see the house of the Lord, gleaming and beautiful. I remember the joy which filled our hearts; we all broke out in songs and praising, and tears ran down the cheeks of many Saints.

Later in the temple, we knelt as a family to hear the beautiful promises about an eternal family, with the certainty that our mother, though absent, was now our mother forever, and we felt the peace which comes from knowing that we are an eternal family.

We accepted the plan and chose to come to earth.

To ensure that we would exercise faith and learn to use our agency properly, a veil of forgetfulness was drawn over our minds so we would not remember God's plan.

Despite their many differences in language, culture, and nationality, they shared a testimony of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and a desire to build Zion—a place of peace, happiness, and beauty in preparation for the Second Coming of the Savior.

Among those first Saints to arrive in Utah was Jane Manning James—the daughter of a freed slave, a convert to the restored Church, and a most remarkable disciple who faced difficult challenges. Sister James remained a faithful Latter-day Saint until her death in 1908.

She wrote: ""I want to say right here, that my faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ as taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is as strong today, nay, it is if possible stronger than it was the day I was first baptized. I pay my tithes and offerings, keep the word of wisdom, I go to bed early and rise early, I try in my feeble way to set a good example to all.""2

Sister James, like so many other Latter-day Saints, not only built Zion with blood, sweat, and tears but also sought the Lord's blessings through living gospel principles as best she could while holding on in faith to Jesus Christ—the great healer to all who sincerely seek Him.

The early Saints were not perfect, but they established a foundation upon which we are building families and a society that love and keep covenants, which is highlighted in various news stories around the world because of our commitment to Jesus Christ and our volunteer efforts to help those nearby and far away.3",2

The divine guidance which has directed the affairs of this Church for over 166 years today, since The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was legally organized on 6 April 1830. What has happened in this work in this relatively short time is a miracle. As a small boy, I remember hearing my great-uncle William Wetzel tell about walking with his family across the American plains to Salt Lake Valley. His stories of struggle, sacrifice, and faith made an indelible impression on my young heart.

When Great-grandfather's family arrived in this valley, most of the members of the Church lived in a group of small, dusty settlements in the territory of Deseret. Many had braved the ocean to come to the United States. Then they traveled by wagon and handcart through the searing heat and the intense cold of the American plains and the high mountain peaks to find peace and worship God.

In large measure, members of our faith were at that time a despised, persecuted, and driven people. But since then has come the fulfillment of the Lord's statement, ""In this the beginning of the rising up and the coming forth of my church out of the wilderness—clear as the moon, and fair as the sun.""1 No one can fully understand how and why the Church has come ""out of obscurity""2 and blossomed without knowing some of the fundamental prophetic truths on which the Church rests.",2

I stand today on the sacred ground that has drawn millions of visitors. In 2002, Salt Lake City hosted the Winter Olympic Games. The Tabernacle Choir sang at the opening ceremonies, and the Church offered concerts and programs for guests and participants from many, many nations. I will always remember seeing the temple in the background of the nightly news broadcasts worldwide.

Over the years, presidents of the United States, kings, judges, prime ministers, ambassadors, and officials from many lands have come to Salt Lake City and met with our leaders. President Nelson hosted leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a United States organization committed to equal rights without discrimination based on race. I remember standing shoulder to shoulder with these friends and leaders as President Nelson joined them in calling for greater civility and racial harmony in the world.23

Many more have come to Temple Square and met in council with Church leaders. For example, this past year, to name just a few, we welcomed the United Nations 68th Civil Society Conference, a global gathering and the first of its kind outside of New York City. We have met with Vietnam's Committee for Religious Affairs and ambassadors from Cuba, the Philippines, Argentina, Romania, Sudan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.

He declared:

""[This valley] is the place God has appointed for His people.

""We have been kicked out of the frying-pan into the fire, out of the fire into the middle of the floor, and here we are and here we will stay. God has shown me that this is the spot to locate His people, and here is where they will prosper; He will temper the elements for the good of His Saints; He will rebuke the frost and the sterility of the soil, and the land shall become fruitful. Brethren, go, now, and plant … your … seeds.""

In addition to promising these blessings, President Young declared that the Salt Lake Valley would become known as a highway to the nations. Kings and emperors would visit the land. Best of all, a temple to the Lord would be erected.3

These were remarkable promises. Many Church members had faith in Brigham Young's prophecies, while others remained skeptical and left for what they assumed would be a better life. Yet history has shown that every prophecy Brigham Young declared has come to pass. The valley did blossom and produce. The Saints prospered. The winter of 1848 was a great catalyst for the Lord to teach His people a valuable lesson. They learned—as we all must learn—that the only sure and secure road to protection in this life comes through trusting in and obeying the counsel from the prophets of God.

Surely one of the crowning blessings of membership in this Church is the blessing of being led by living prophets of God. The Lord declared, ""There is never but one on the earth at a time on whom this power and the keys of this priesthood are conferred.""4 The prophet and President of the Church today, Thomas S. Monson, receives God's word for the entire membership of the Church and for the world.

""Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

""Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen"" (Matthew 28:19–20).

Latter-day Saints take seriously this responsibility to teach all people in all nations about the Lord Jesus Christ and His restored gospel. We believe the same Church founded by the Savior anciently has been reestablished on the earth by Him in the latter days.

Both categories are authoritative, since both are viewed as coming from God.

The first definition uses ""scripture"" as synonymous with such terms as ""inspired"" or ""divinely revealed."" Concerning those who have been called and ordained to proclaim God's word, a revelation in the Doctrine and Covenants provides the foundation: ""Whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation"" (D&C 68:4). In this light, Latter-day Saints hold in high regard the words of Church leaders at all levels. Especially authoritative are the official pronouncements of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who are sustained by Church members as ""prophets, seers, and revelators."" Their writings and addresses-particularly in general conference-are cited frequently as guides for living and for authoritative interpretation of doctrine. Statements issued by the First Presidency represent the official position and policy of the Church.

Joseph Smith taught that ""a prophet was a prophet only when he was acting as such"" (*HC* 5:265). Thus, the words of prophets carry the force of scripture only when they are uttered under the influence of the Holy Ghost. Latter-day Saints freely acknowledge this divine influence in the teachings and counsel of leaders and deem it a privilege to be instructed by them. They consider this inspired direction to be ""scripture"" in the broad definition and endeavor to harmonize their lives with it.",3

Latter-day Saints teach that all are entitled to this assurance and testimony. Second, the President of the Church and those associated with him as prophets, seers, and revelators have received a special spiritual Endowment and jurisdiction. The President alone speaks or writes for the Church and to the Church as a whole. Others can function similarly, but only within their own offices and callings. Further, ""a prophet was a prophet only when he was acting as such"" (*HC* 5:265; 2:302; *TPJS*, p. 278). Those officially called and ordained to lead are, in LDS terminology, the ""living oracles,"" and ""Where the oracles of God are not there the Kingdom of God is not"" (*WJS*, p. 156).

Therefore, being in the scriptures is one way we receive the Holy Ghost. Of course, scripture is given through the Holy Ghost in the first place (see 2 Peter 1:21; D&C 20:26–27; 68:4), and that same Spirit can attest its truth to you and me. Study the scriptures carefully, deliberately. Ponder and pray over them. Scriptures are revelation, and they will bring added revelation.

Consider the magnitude of our blessing to have the Holy Bible and some 900 additional pages of scripture, including the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Then consider that, in addition, the words of prophets spoken as they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost in settings such as this, which the Lord calls scripture (see D&C 68:2–4), flow to us almost constantly by television, radio, Internet, satellite, CD, DVD, and in print. I suppose that never in history has a people been blessed with such a quantity of holy writ. And not only that, but every man, woman, and child may possess and study his or her own personal copy of these sacred texts, most in his or her own language. How incredible such a thing would have seemed to the people of William Tyndale's day and to the Saints of earlier dispensations! Surely with this blessing the Lord is telling us that our need for constant recourse to the scriptures is greater than in any previous time. May we feast continuously on the words of Christ that will tell us all things we should do (see 2 Nephi 32:3).

Further, ""the best way to obtain truth and wisdom is not to ask it from books, but to go to God in prayer, and obtain divine teaching"" (*TPJS*, p. 191). Brigham Young asserted that ""I would rather have the living oracles than all the writing in the books"" (cited in *CR*, Oct. 1897, pp. 22-23). But living oracles and responsible laymen are not, in theory or in tradition, wholly independent of the written word. B. H. Roberts, an authoritative second-generation historian and a General Authority, wrote of the corpus of scripture:
It fixes permanently the general truths which God has revealed. It preserves, for all time and for all generations of men, the great frame-work of the plan of salvation-the Gospel. There are certain truths that are not affected by ever-changing circumstances; truths which are always the same, no matter how often they may be revealed; truths which are elementary, permanent, fixed; from which there must not be, and cannot be, any departure without condemnation. The written word of God preserves the people of God from vain and foolish traditions, which, as they float down the stream of time, are subject to changes by distortion, by addition or subtraction, or by the fitful play of fancy in fantastic and unreliable minds. It forms a standard by which even the living oracles of God may instruct themselves, measure themselves, and correct themselves. It places within the reach of the people, the power to confirm the oral words, and the ministry of the living oracles, and thus to add faith to faith, and knowledge to knowledge [*IE* 3 (May 1900):576-77].",3

The idea of an open canon has meant historically a certain openness to other historical, apocryphal, and pseudepigraphical sources. Modern scripture assures Latter-day Saints that important records will yet come to light (cf. 2 Ne. 29:10-14; A of F 9). The Old Testament Apocrypha contains many things ""that are true"" but also many interpolations (D&C 91); ""To those who desire it, should be given by the Spirit to know the true from the false"" (*HC* 1:363).

The Church's lay participation, which entails the sharing of responsibility, and the law of common consent operate together in the process of presenting, confirming, and accepting the inspired word.

For Latter-day Saints, the scriptures are not reducible to scientific history, sociology, or folklore; a simple set of fundamentals, commandments, and legal apparatus; charming parabolic accounts; esoteric and hidden names with mystical connections that have a power and life of their own. The scriptures are the result of an outpouring from on high whose present meaning and relevance to a person require painstaking study and direct inspiration.

Objecting to the views of the Torah as a closed world, Martin Buber wrote, ""To you God is one who created once and not again; but to us God is He who ""renews the work of creation every day.' To you God is One who revealed Himself once and no more; but to us He speaks out of the burning thornbush of the present&#133;in the revelations of our innermost hearts-greater than words"" (p. 204).

Scriptures contain the record of the self-revelation of God, and through them God speaks to man. Where could there be more profitable use of time than reading from the scriptural library the literature that teaches us to know God and understand our relationship to him? Time is always precious to busy people, and we are robbed of its worth when hours are wasted in reading or viewing that which is frivolous and of little value.

Reading habits vary widely. There are rapid readers and slow readers, some who read only small snatches at a time and others who persist without stopping until the book is finished. Those who delve into the scriptural library, however, find that to understand requires more than casual reading or perusal—there must be concentrated study.

Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe that ""all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable"" (2 Timothy 3:16). We love the Bible and other scriptures.

It is one of the pillars of our faith, a powerful witness of the Savior and of Christ's ongoing influence in the lives of those who worship and follow Him. The more we read and study the Bible and its teachings, the more clearly we see the doctrinal underpinnings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. We tend to love the scriptures that we spend time with. We may need to balance our study in order to love and understand all scripture.

You young people especially, do not discount or devalue the Holy Bible. It is the sacred, holy record of the Lord's life. The Bible contains hundreds of pages more than all of our other scripture combined. It is the bedrock of all Christianity. We do not criticize or belittle anyone's beliefs.

Those who join this Church do not give up their faith in the Bible—they strengthen it. The Book of Mormon does not dilute nor diminish nor de-emphasize the Bible. On the contrary, it expands, extends, and exalts it. The Book of Mormon testifies of the Bible, and both testify of Christ.",3

While the Church views its scriptures as a canon in a strict sense, they are not viewed as closed. The doctrine of continuing revelation is one of the fundamental beliefs of the Church. As was expressed by Joseph Smith, ""We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God"" (A of F 9). While accepting ""all that God has revealed,"" whether canonized in the scriptures or not, Latter-day Saints also believe that revelation continues to enlighten their leaders.

I have read it many times. I have also read much that has been written about it. Some authors have focused upon its stories, its people, or its vignettes of history. Others have been intrigued by its language structure or its records of weapons, geography, animal life, techniques of building, or systems of weights and measures.

Interesting as these matters may be, study of the Book of Mormon is most rewarding when one focuses on its *primary* purpose—to testify of Jesus Christ. By comparison, all other issues are incidental.

When you read the Book of Mormon, concentrate on the principal figure in the book—from its first chapter to the last—the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God.3 And look for a second undergirding theme: God will keep His covenants with the remnants of the house of Israel.4

The Book of Mormon is a crucial component of that covenant.5 It is holy scripture that encompasses sacred writings from the small and large plates of Nephi, the plates of Mormon, the plates of Ether, and the plates of brass, which contained ""the five books of Moses, … a record of the Jews, … and … prophecies of the holy prophets.""6

When Mormon abridged these records, he noted that he could not write a ""hundredth part"" of their proceedings.7 Thus, *historical* aspects of the book assume *secondary* significance.",2

When we accept the ancient roots of the book and believe that Joseph Smith did have ancient records that could not be in English, we then may ask how he translated them. The only reasonable answer is the way he said: by divine revelation.

What would be more perilous to us, eternally, than to say the Book of Mormon is holy scripture if it were not? Those who have questions or concerns about the Church may cling in security to this firm anchor that is immutable and tangible evidence of the truthfulness of the Church.

The Book of Mormon prophet Nephi wrote: ""For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do"" (2 Ne. 25:23).",2

The *fulness* of the gospel, therefore, connotes a fuller comprehension of the Atonement.22 This we do not obtain from the Bible alone. The word *atonement,* in any of its forms, is mentioned only once in the King James Version of the New Testament.23 In the Book of Mormon, it appears 39 times The Book of Mormon also contains more references to the Resurrection than does the Bible.25

The Savior referred to the Book of Mormon as His ""new covenant"" with the house of Israel.26 It is a tangible sign of Christ's culminating covenant with mankind.27 The divine teachings of this book, as a third testament, clarify doctrine and unify the Old Testament with the New Testament. Scriptural covenants,28 testaments,29 and witnesses30 since the beginning of time relate to the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the central act of all human history.

The Book of Mormon is the most important religious text to be revealed from God to man ""since the writings of the New Testament were compiled nearly two millennia ago.""31 Joseph Smith declared the Book of Mormon to be ""the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion.""32 It is the only book that the Lord Himself has testified to be true.33",3

The central event in the Book of Mormon is the appearance of the resurrected Christ to righteous inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere after his ascension into heaven at Jerusalem. During his visit, Christ delivered a sermon that is similar to the Sermon on the Mount recorded in the New Testament, but with certain vital clarifications and additions. He declared his doctrine, the fulness of his gospel necessary to enter the kingdom of God; and he established his Church with its essential ordinances, and ordained disciples to preside over the Church. At this time, Christ also explained the promises of God to Israel; healed the sick and disabled; blessed the children and their parents; and expressed his great love, allowing each individual to come forward and touch the wounds he had received during his crucifixion (see 3 Ne. 11-26). The record of Jesus' visit and many other passages in the Book of Mormon verify the divine sonship, ministry, Atonement, resurrection, and eternal status of the Lord Jesus Christ and show that the fulness of his gospel is the same for all people, whenever and wherever they have lived.",3

Have you ever wondered why there are so many Christian churches in the world today when they obtain their doctrines from essentially the same Bible? It is because they interpret the Bible differently. If they interpreted it the same, they would be the same church. This is not a condition the Lord desires, for the Apostle Paul declared that there is ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism"" (Ephesians 4:5). To help bring this oneness about, the Lord established a divine law of witnesses. Paul taught, ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Corinthians 13:1).

The Bible is one witness of Jesus Christ; the Book of Mormon is another. Why is this second witness so crucial? The following illustration may help: How many straight lines can you draw through a single point on a piece of paper? The answer is infinite. For a moment, suppose that single point represents the Bible and that hundreds of those straight lines drawn through that point represent different interpretations of the Bible and that each of those interpretations represents a different church.

What happens, however, if on that piece of paper there is a second point representing the Book of Mormon? How many straight lines could you draw between these two reference points: the Bible and the Book of Mormon? Only one. Only one interpretation of Christ's doctrines survives the testimony of these two witnesses.",3

To members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Book of Mormon forms the doctrinal foundation of the Church and speaks the word of God to all the world.

The Book of Mormon both confirms and supplements the Bible: ""Behold, this [the Book of Mormon] is written for the intent that ye may believe that [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe [the Book of Mormon] also"" (Morm. 7:9). The Bible is primarily a record of God's dealings with the forebears and descendants of Jacob or Israel in the ancient Near East. Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of God's dealings principally with another group of Israelites he brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem about 600 B.C. (see Lehi). They anticipated the birth and coming of Jesus Christ and believed in his Atonement and gospel. Their complex, lengthy records were abridged by a prophet named Mormon, inscribed on plates of gold, and buried by his son, Moroni 2, after internecine wars destroyed all of the believers in Christ in the New World except Moroni (A.D. 385).",3

Despite the Broadway musical generating a lot of attention, its storyline has little to do with the Book of Mormon's contents, plots, origins, or the principles it teaches. One thing the play happens to get right, however, is that the Book of Mormon has something important to say about music and performance.

Three mutually supportive avenues are most often followed. First, the book serves as a source of guidance and doctrine, yielding lessons and wisdom applicable to contemporary life. This approach is recommended in the writings of Nephi, who wrote that he ""did liken the scriptures unto [his people], that it might be for [their] profit and learning"" (1 Ne. 19:23). Latter-day Saints find its pages rich with ennobling narratives, clear doctrines, eternal truths, memorable sayings, and principles. Knowing the conditions of the latter days, the ancient prophets periodically address the individual reader directly. Latter-day Saints emphasize the need to read the Book of Mormon prayerfully, with faith in God, to benefit personally from its teachings and to come unto Christ.

A second approach to the Book of Mormon, adding historical dimension to the first approach, is to study the book as an ancient text. The reader who accepts the Book of Mormon as an ancient Hebrew lineage history written by prophets in the New World will find the book consistent with that description and setting. The book is a repository of ancient cultures that are as far removed from modern readers as are those of the Old and New Testaments. Continuing research has found Hebrew poetic forms, rhetorical patterns, and idioms, together with many Mesoamerican symbols, traditions, and artifacts, to be implicit in the book or consistent with it.",1

God has so declared it, so have its writers, so have its witnesses, and so do all those who have read it and received a personal revelation from God as to its truthfulness.

In section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord says that he gave Joseph Smith ""power from on high … to translate the Book of Mormon; Which contains … the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ … ; Which was given by inspiration."" (D&C 20:8–10.)",3

By testifying of Christ and revealing his enemies.

How are we to use it? We are to get a testimony of it, we are to teach from it, we are to hold it up as a standard and ""hiss it forth.""

Have we been doing this? Not as we should, nor as we must.

Do eternal consequences rest upon our response to this book? Yes, either to our blessing or our condemnation.

Every Latter-day Saint should make the study of this book a lifetime pursuit. Otherwise he is placing his soul in jeopardy and neglecting that which could give spiritual and intellectual unity to his whole life. There is a difference between a convert who is built on the rock of Christ through the Book of Mormon and stays hold of that iron rod, and one who is not.

Over a quarter of a century ago I listened in this Tabernacle to these words: ""A few years ago as I began to practice law, members of my family were a little uneasy. They were afraid I would lose my faith. I wanted to practice law, but I had an even greater desire to keep my testimony, and so I decided upon a little procedure which I recommend to you. For thirty minutes each morning before I began the day's work I read from the Book of Mormon . … and in just a few minutes a day I read the Book of Mormon through, every year, for nine years. I know that it kept me in harmony, so far as I did keep in harmony, with the Spirit of the Lord."" (Conference Report, Apr. 1949, p. 36.) It will hold us as close to the Spirit of the Lord as anything I know. That was President Marion G. Romney. I echo his counsel.

What, then, are we to say of the Book of Mormon? I bear witness that it is verily true. I know this as I know that I live. We stand with the Prophet Joseph Smith when he said, ""I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.""

President Ezra Taft Benson affirmed, ""I have noted within the Church the difference in discernment, in insight, conviction, and spirit between those who know and love the Book of Mormon and those who do not. That book is a great sifter."" (New Era, May 1975, p. 19.) An understanding of the Book of Mormon can really help lock into place an individual's faith in Jesus Christ.

It is important to know what the Book of Mormon is *not.* It is not primarily a history, although much of what it contains is historical. The title page states that it is an account taken from the records of people living in the Americas before and after Christ. It was ""written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation. … And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.""

George Q. Cannon stated that ""the Book of Mormon is not a geographical primer. It was not written to teach geographical truths. What is told us of the situation of the various lands or cities … is usually simply an incidental remark connected with the doctrinal or historical portions of the work."" (Juvenile Instructor, Jan. 1890, p. 18.)

What, then, is the Book of Mormon? It is confirming evidence of the birth, life, and crucifixion of Jesus and of his work as the Messiah and the Redeemer. Nephi writes about the Book of Mormon: ""All ye ends of the earth, hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in these words believe in Christ. And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ."" (2 Ne. 33:10.)",2

We are not obligated to answer every objection. Every man eventually is backed up to the wall of faith, and there he must make his stand.

(2 Ne. 33:11.) Every man must judge for himself, knowing God will hold him accountable.

The Book of Mormon is to be used ""for a standard unto my people, which are of the house of Israel,"" the Lord says, and its words ""shall hiss forth unto the ends of the earth."" (2 Ne. 29:2.) We, the members of the Church, and particularly the missionaries, have to be the ""hissers,"" or the tellers and testifiers, of the Book of Mormon unto the ends of the earth.

The Book of Mormon is the great standard we are to use. It shows that Joseph Smith was a prophet. It contains the words of Christ, and its great mission is to bring men to Christ and all other things are secondary. The golden question of the Book of Mormon is ""Do you want to learn more of Christ?"" The Book of Mormon is the great finder of the golden contact. It does not contain things which are ""pleasing unto the world"" (1 Ne. 6:5), and so the worldly are not interested in it. It is a great sieve.",3

There are many favorites. The book is used to teach children doctrines, provide examples of the Christlike life, and remind them of God's great love and hope for all his children.

The book is central to missionary work. It is the Church's most important missionary tool and is destined to go to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people (Rev. 14:6-7).

Our families may be corrupted by worldly trends and teachings unless we know how to use the book to expose and combat the falsehoods in socialism, organic evolution, rationalism, humanism, etc. Our missionaries are not as effective unless they are ""hissing forth"" with it. Social, ethical, cultural, or educational converts will not survive under the heat of the day unless their taproots go down to the fulness of the gospel which the Book of Mormon contains. Our Church classes are not as spirit-filled unless we hold it up as a standard. And our nation will continue to degenerate unless we read and heed the words of the God of this land, Jesus Christ, and quit building up and upholding the secret combinations which the Book of Mormon tells us proved the downfall of both previous American civilizations.

Some of the early missionaries, on returning home, were reproved by the Lord in section 84 of the Doctrine and Covenants because they had treated lightly the Book of Mormon. As a result, their minds had been darkened. The Lord said that this kind of treatment of the Book of Mormon brought the whole Church under condemnation, even all of the children of Zion. And then the Lord said, ""And they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon."" (See D&C 84:54–57.)

It is a collection of writings by prophets who lived in the Western Hemisphere, who believed in Christ, and who prophesied of Christ, some of whom associated with Christ during the brief time He visited the Americas after His resurrection. Those ancient American prophets wrote the Book of Mormon for our day. It has withstood every conceivable test by both skeptical and sincere minds. It is not on trial. We are the ones on trial, being tested by our acceptance or rejection of its truths, teachings, commandments, and declarations (see 2 Ne. 33:11–14).

President Ezra Taft Benson reminded us forcefully that if we forget to teach and preach the Book of Mormon, and if we forget to study and meditate on the contents of this book of Holy Writ, we will be under condemnation.

While the Bible bears record of teachings the Lord gave to His prophets who lived in the Old World, the Book of Mormon contains teachings the Lord gave to His prophets who lived in the American hemisphere. This record covers a period of about a thousand years, from approximately 600 b.c. to a.d. 400 (although there is reference to other migrations and peoples preceding that time). The Book of Mormon bears record of the personal ministry of Jesus Christ, as the resurrected Lord, to inhabitants of ancient America. Prophets recorded His teachings among them. Hence, the Book of Mormon is ""Another Testament of Jesus Christ"" (Book of Mormon Title Page). It came in fulfillment of biblical prophecy: ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Cor. 13:1). It came as a heavenly gift to the entire human family. Originally inscribed on metallic plates and written in a modified Egyptian language, that record was preserved for many centuries, then made available for translation into the English language. That translation was done by the Prophet Joseph Smith through the gift and power of God. Subsequently, the book has been translated into many other languages. Since its first publication in 1830, millions of copies of the Book of Mormon have been printed. In the year 1992 alone, nearly five million copies were distributed.

We have observed that sincere study of the Book of Mormon transforms the spirit and engenders a testimony of Jesus Christ that heals the spiritual hearts of men and women throughout the world. The more widely it is read and understood, the greater is its influence for good.

This same Moroni, as an angelic being sent from God, showed these ancient records to three witnesses in our day. Their testimony of the records is contained in the front of the Book of Mormon. They state: ""We also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true.""

And Joseph Smith, the Prophet, the instrument whom God used to translate this record, testified that ""the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book."" (History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 4:461.)

The Book of Mormon was written for us today. God is the author of the book. It is a record of a fallen people, compiled by inspired men for our blessing today. Those people never had the book—it was meant for us. Mormon, the ancient prophet after whom the book is named, abridged centuries of records. God, who knows the end from the beginning, told him what to include in his abridgment that we would need for our day. Mormon turned the records over to his son Moroni, the last recorder; and Moroni, writing over 1,500 years ago but speaking to us today, states: ""Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing."" (Morm. 8:35.)

Many details about the religious teachings and practices of these people are found in the Book of Mormon.

Nephi prophesied that many ""plain and precious"" truths and covenants would be taken from the gospel and the Bible after the deaths of the apostles (1 Ne. 13:26-27). Many questions that have arisen from the Bible are answered for Latter-day Saints by the Book of Mormon, such as the mode of and reasons for baptism (2 Ne. 31; 3 Ne. 11:23-26); the proper way to administer the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper (Moro. 4-5); the nature of the Resurrection (Alma 40); the effects of the Fall of Adam, and the reasons for evil and suffering in the world (2 Ne. 2). The Book of Mormon reinforces the LDS doctrine that the gospel of Jesus Christ existed before the Creation and has been revealed to prophets and believers throughout time.

Also sacred to Latter-day Saints is the Book of Mormon as a tutor in discerning the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Many Latter-day Saints, including those born into LDS families, trace their conversion to Jesus Christ and their commitment toward the Church to prayerful study of the Book of Mormon, and through it they learn to recognize the Holy Spirit. Thus, the book becomes a continuing symbol of personal revelation and of God's love for and attention to the needs of each person. It also declares that all mankind will be judged by its precepts and commandments (Mosiah 3:24; Moro. 10:27; see Judgment). It is evidence that God remembers every creature he has created (Mosiah 27:30) and every covenant he has made (1 Ne. 19:15; 3 Ne. 16:11).

It gives an account of Christ's visit to the people of this continent. It corroborates and complements the Bible. It establishes the truth of the Bible.

The Book of Mormon is a prophetic book. Its coming forth fulfills many biblical prophecies.

The Book of Mormon was given to the world with the admonition that man should test its authenticity by reading it and asking God if it is true. Before concluding the record of the Nephites, Moroni, the last surviving prophet of these people, wrote to those who would read the record in the latter days:

""When ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.""

At last, in A.D. 385, the few remaining Nephites were hunted and killed by Lamanites. The book ends with Moroni, the last Nephite, writing to the people of modern times, admonishing them to ""come unto Christ, and be perfected in him"" (Moro. 10:32).

**MODERN APPLICATIONS.** Latter-day Saints embrace the Book of Mormon as a record for all people. In addition to instructing their contemporaries and descendants, the prophets who wrote these ancient records foresaw modern conditions and selected lessons needed to meet the challenges of this world (Morm. 8:34-35). Their book is a record of a fallen people, urging all people to live righteously and prevent a similar fall today.

The Book of Mormon has had a profound effect on the Church and its members. It is so fundamental that Joseph Smith said, ""Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations and where is our religion? We have none"" (*TPJS*, p. 71).

The Book of Mormon teaches that the living God has spoken to several peoples throughout the earth who have written sacred records as he has commanded (2 Ne. 29:11-12). The Book of Mormon is one such record.

It also stands as evidence to Latter-day Saints that God restored his true and living Church through Joseph Smith.

I often wonder if we take as seriously as we should this great record. Early in the Church the members seemed to be taking the Book of Mormon too lightly. The Lord gave the following warning and condemnation. This might be as applicable today as it was then.

""And your minds in times past have been darkened because of unbelief, and because you have treated lightly the things you have received—

""Which vanity and unbelief have brought the whole church under condemnation.

""And this condemnation resteth upon the children of Zion, even all.

""And they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon and the former commandments which I have given them, not only to say, but to do according to that which I have written—

""That they may bring forth fruit meet for their Father's kingdom; otherwise there remaineth a scourge and judgment to be poured out upon the children of Zion."" (D&C 84:54–58.)

Joseph Smith observed that ""our latitude and longitude can be determined in the original Hebrew with far greater accuracy than in the English version. There is a grand distinction between the actual meaning of the prophets and the present translation"" (*TPJS*, pp. 290-91).

If the Old Testament words of Moses were sufficient, as some could have mistakenly thought them to be,3 then why, for example, the subsequent prophecies of Isaiah or of Jeremiah, who follows him? To say nothing of Ezekiel and Daniel, of Joel, Amos, and all the rest. If one revelation to one prophet in one moment of time is sufficient for *all* time, what justifies these many others? What justifies them was made clear by Jehovah Himself when He said to Moses, ""My works are without end, and … my words … never cease.""4

One Protestant scholar has inquired tellingly into the erroneous doctrine of a closed canon. He writes: ""On what biblical or historical grounds has the inspiration of God been limited to the written documents that the church now calls its Bible? … If the Spirit inspired only the written documents of the first century, does that mean that the same Spirit does not speak today in the church about matters that are of significant concern?""5 We humbly ask those same questions.

Continuing revelation does not demean or discredit existing revelation. The Old Testament does not lose its value in our eyes when we are introduced to the New Testament, and the New Testament is only enhanced when we read the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. In considering the additional scripture accepted by Latter-day Saints, we might ask: Were those early Christians who for decades had access only to the primitive Gospel of Mark (generally considered the first of the New Testament Gospels to be written)—were they offended to receive the more detailed accounts set forth later by Matthew and Luke, to say nothing of the unprecedented passages and revelatory emphasis offered later yet by John? Surely they must have rejoiced that ever more convincing evidence of the divinity of Christ kept coming. And so do we rejoice.",3

No other collection of writings carried the insight, the power of teaching, and, consequently, the spiritual appeal to Christians. The New Testament also stands as the foundation of the restoration of the gospel in the latter days. It was while reading in the Epistle of James (1:5) that the youthful Joseph Smith was inspired to pray to the Lord about his confusion over religious matters, leading to his first vision (JS-H 1:7-20). The New Testament is one of the standard works or canonized scriptures accepted by Latter-day Saints, who seek spiritual strength and enlightenment from its pages. Further, they accept the New Testament sketches as accurate portrayals of the life and ministry of Jesus Christ as well as the ministry of his apostles and their associates, that reveal much of the order and organization of the earliest New Testament Church. Moreover, the New Testament includes many of God's covenants and commandments given personally by Jesus and, after his ascension, through his apostles. Latter-day Saints also value the New Testament prophecies about the latter days.

The writings of the New Testament were likely all produced within the first Christian century of the Christian era. Even so, its collection of texts went through three centuries of changes, and acceptance or rejection, before it acquired its recognized and current form, first listed in the Easter letter of Athanasius in Egypt in A.D. 367. The third synod of Carthage (A.D. 397) canonized the books of the New Testament as represented in the letter of Athanasius because each writing had three qualifications: apostolic authority, support of a major Christian community, and an absence of false teachings.",1

The idea of an open canon has meant historically a certain openness to other historical, apocryphal, and pseudepigraphical sources. Modern scripture assures Latter-day Saints that important records will yet come to light (cf. 2 Ne. 29:10-14; A of F 9). The Old Testament Apocrypha contains many things ""that are true"" but also many interpolations (D&C 91); ""To those who desire it, should be given by the Spirit to know the true from the false"" (*HC* 1:363). By analogy, other documents recently recovered (e.g., the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Nag Hammadi library, and related inscriptions and fragments) are viewed as instructive, though not canonical.

The word ""canon"" is used infrequently, in part because it connotes finality, completion, closure. In principle and in fact, additions, as well as occasional official clarifications and translations, are made to the standard works in the dual process of presentation through living leaders and, in accord with the law of common consent, acceptance by members of the Church. In this way, Latter-day Saints bind themselves by covenant to uphold them as scripture. The addition to the Doctrine and Covenants of both a revelation about the Celestial Kingdom received by Joseph Smith and a vision of the redemption of the dead received by President Joseph F. Smith are modern examples (D&C 137, 138).

The perpetual unending character of the scripture, a corpus ever augmented by living witnesses in a setting of prophecy and testimony, is a sign and symbol of the inclusiveness of LDS faith (Davies, p. 61). Such a position is in contrast with finalist and minimalist views (""one canon is enough""). The Samaritans, for example, accorded scriptural status to the Pentateuch alone. For Latter-day Saints, scripture is not ""final revelation."" There is no unexpandable ""circle of faith."" No sacred texts, because of their acknowledged holiness, forbid the addition of more sacred texts. No document or collection is ""all-sufficient"" for redemption, for salvation, for complete enlightenment, or for the perfecting of the soul.",3

Centuries after it was determined which books were to be included in the Bible, people began to believe and teach that the Bible was both complete (containing all that God had given through ancient prophets and apostles) and infallible (having been transmitted without any errors). Joseph Smith received correctives to both ideas, being given additional scripture originally written by ancient prophets and being inspired to make corrections in the texts of the Bible. Among the ancient writings he restored are the book of Abraham and the writings of Moses (canonized as the Book of Moses, itself including a restoration to Moses of an older Enoch writing; see Moses 6-7); quotations from ancient biblical prophets in the Book of Mormon (such as Joseph of Egypt and four otherwise unknown writers named Zenos, Zenock, Neum, and Ezias); and writings from the New Testament apostle John (see D&C 7 and 93).

Joseph Smith commented on the Bible's incompleteness: ""It was apparent that many important points touching the salvation of men, had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled"" (*TPJS*, pp. 10-11). He later said, ""Much instruction has been given to man since the beginning which we do not possess now&#133;. We have what we have, and the Bible contains what it does contain"" (*TPJS*, p. 61). The Prophet Joseph further stated, ""I believe the Bible as it read when it came from the pen of the original writers. Ignorant translators, careless transcribers, or designing and corrupt priests have committed many errors"" (*TPJS*, p. 327). Thus, the elements of mistranslation, incompleteness, and other errors weaken the Bible; but the spirit of its messages still reveals enough of God's word to fulfill his appointed purposes. Joseph Smith summarized thus: ""Through the kind providence of our Father a portion of His word which He delivered to His ancient saints, has fallen into our hands [and] is presented to us with a promise of a reward if obeyed, and with a penalty if disobeyed"" (*TPJS*, p. 61). Latter-day Saints have continued to trust in the general accuracy of the biblical texts even though they know that that text may not always be correct. Thus, they study and revere the Bible, especially in the context of other scriptures and modern revelation, which have much to say about the Bible and how it is to be interpreted, and as they study they ponder and pray that they may receive inspiration from God and come to understand the Bible's messages as they need to be applied in their lives (cf.

Two guesses who that last line is aimed at.

The Catholic Church also defines those ""private"" revelations as calling people to Christ, or visions like those given to Joan of Arc, rather than a witness that the Pope is divinely called of God.

A somewhat parallel statement came to Joseph Smith in June 1830 while he was restoring a revelation received by Moses, declaring that many things would be taken ""from the book"" which Moses would write, but that the missing information would be restored through another prophet and thus be ""had again"" among those who believe (Moses 1:41). Latter-day Saints believe that the ""other records"" referred to include the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, the JST, and other records still to come forth, and that the prophet divinely raised up to begin restoring the lost material is Joseph Smith (see Scriptures: Forthcoming Scripture). In light of the foregoing statements, it is worth observing that the principal difficulty in the Bible apparently has been omissions.

A careful reading of each of these admonitions makes it clear that *man* is not to make changes in the revelations of the Lord: *man* is not to add to or take from the words of God.

We remember that at the end of the book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible, the author, John, issues a warning and a curse upon any man who adds to or takes away from the book. Specifically, these are the words he wrote:

""For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:

""And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."" (Rev. 22:18–19.)

These verses of scripture have been cited repeatedly by those attempting to discredit the Book of Mormon, claiming that God's revelation to man is closed. Nothing more is to be added and nothing is to be taken away. They assert that the Book of Mormon is an attempt to add to the words of the Bible.

Those scholars of our day acknowledge a number of New Testament ""books"" that were almost certainly written *after* John's revelation on the Isle of Patmos was received. Included in this category are at least the books of Jude, the three Epistles of John, and probably the entire Gospel of John itself.1 Perhaps there are even more than these.

But there is a simpler answer as to why that passage in the final book of the current New Testament cannot apply to the whole Bible. That is because the whole Bible as we know it—one collection of texts bound in a single volume—did not exist when that verse was written.

Were it not for continuous revelation, Noah would not have been prepared for the deluge that encompassed the earth. Abraham would not have been guided from Haran to Hebron, the Land of Promise. Continuous revelation led the children of Israel from bondage back to their promised land. Revelation through prophets guided missionary efforts, directed the rebuilding of Solomon's temple, and denounced the infiltration of pagan practices among the Israelites.

Before the ascension of Christ, he promised the remaining eleven apostles, ""lo, I am with you alway, Even unto the end of the world."" (Matt. 28:20.) Following his ascension, he guided the Church by revelation until the death of the Apostles and subsequent apostasy of the Church of Jesus Christ.

A distinctive sign of the last days that will precede the eventual second coming of the Lord was seen in vision by that same Apostle who recorded the book of Revelation. He said:

""I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people."" (Rev. 14:6.)

The fact that John saw a messenger from God reveal anew a lost gospel negates the argument that further revelation could not be added to the Bible.",3

If, for example, you go to Deuteronomy chapter 4 verses 1 through 2. God says O Israel, hearken unto the statutes and judgments and he says do not add unto the word which I command you and don't diminish it and don't take away. If you go back to Revelation chapter 22 verse 17, actually verse – Revelation 22 verse 19: ""If any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life."" People have interpreted this as saying no more revelation. No more revelation. And even here in D and C section 20 we want to be careful to not misinterpret what God has been saying in Deuteronomy, in the Book of Revelation, and right here.

It's not about God cannot add or change revelation. It actually comes to the core idea of a covenant which we've talked about a lot. And we've talked about it a lot because it' so significant. God wants to come together with us. And imagine God owns the covenant. He offers us the terms of the covenant. Should we be changing the terms? No. God can change the terms and offer them to us which we can accept, that's when we say amen after covenantal rituals but we are not supposed to be changing covenants. Now let me just use a brief example. If you've ever received a loan from a bank, say, for a mortgage? Would you go home with that agreement – that covenant with a bank – and you, without the bank's authorization, you change the agreement. That doesn't work. Now the bank can change the agreement; they can update the terms. It is their prerogative, they're the one who offered you all this money and so in some ways you're kind of duty-bound to follow their recommendations of really what they expect you to do. And if you don't, you have to give all the money back.",1

Not only do they attack the authenticity of that sacred volume, but they question our right to have scriptures other than the Bible.

We Latter-day Saints have three volumes of scripture in addition to the Bible. They are additional witnesses for the Lord Jesus Christ, declaring to all who are willing to read them that He is our Savior and our Redeemer. In this day of trouble and doubt, shall we not be grateful for increased affirmations of the Christ?

Having been taught that the Bible contains all of the word of God, some ask us why we have these other scriptures. They do not realize that the Bible provides for more scripture and that it points to a pattern established anciently by the Lord in which He placed prophets on earth to provide that scripture.

Their revelations were recorded, together with some of the history of the times, and became scripture. As each new prophet wrote, his records were added to the existing scripture. In this way there was a constantly growing volume of the sacred word. Eventually many of these writings were compiled into a book which we know as the Bible.

This process continued as long as the Lord had prophets on earth, both in Old and New Testament times. Never was it thought that this accumulated record contained all of the word of God because, over the years, the Lord continued to send new prophets who received new revelations which in turn became new and additional scripture. It was a set pattern of the Lord from the days of the patriarchs to the time of John the Revelator.

There are some who do not realize that there were prophets in the original Christian church and that it was the intention of the Lord that they should continue in the Church until we all come to a unity of the faith.

But instead of unity among Christians, what do we have? We have division, which is overwhelming evidence of the need for the continued ministry of Christian prophets.",1

Without additional revelation to guide them, men began to interpret the Bible differently. Numerous churches and creeds developed, each using the Bible as its authoritative source.

But this in no way lessens the worth of the Bible. That sacred and holy book has been of inestimable worth to the children of men. In fact, it was a passage from the Bible that inspired the Prophet Joseph Smith to go to a grove of trees near his home and kneel in prayer. What followed was the glorious vision that commenced the restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth. That vision also began the process of bringing forth new scripture to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Bible in bearing witness to a wicked world that Jesus is the Christ and that God lives and loves His children and is still intimately involved in their salvation and exaltation.

Through the prophet Nephi, the Lord warned against those who might say that the Bible was all the scripture the world would need. He said:

""Know ye not that there are more nations than one? Know ye not that I, the Lord your God, have created all men, … and I bring forth my word unto the children of men, yea, even upon all the nations of the earth? …

""Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness unto you that I am God, that I remember one nation like unto another? …

She was disappointed with what those erring enemies of the Church were teaching, but was excited to find herself back thinking clearly again. All we had done was read from the scriptures together. Confusion and mistakes come when we forget the importance of God's word as our unwavering guide.

A friend asked me several months ago why so many problems have been plaguing a number of the members of the Church recently. I hesitatingly answered, ""Well, the last days are surely approaching when even the elect shall be deceived."" (See Matt. 24:24.) He looked at me momentarily and said, ""Well, perhaps that might be a little of it, but I believe the real reason that so many are wandering on strange paths is because they do not follow prophetic counsel to study the scriptures and attend the classes in Church.""

Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe that ""all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable"" (2 Timothy 3:16). We love the Bible and other scriptures.

It is one of the pillars of our faith, a powerful witness of the Savior and of Christ's ongoing influence in the lives of those who worship and follow Him. The more we read and study the Bible and its teachings, the more clearly we see the doctrinal underpinnings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. We tend to love the scriptures that we spend time with. We may need to balance our study in order to love and understand all scripture.

You young people especially, do not discount or devalue the Holy Bible. It is the sacred, holy record of the Lord's life. The Bible contains hundreds of pages more than all of our other scripture combined. It is the bedrock of all Christianity. We do not criticize or belittle anyone's beliefs.

Those who join this Church do not give up their faith in the Bible—they strengthen it. The Book of Mormon does not dilute nor diminish nor de-emphasize the Bible. On the contrary, it expands, extends, and exalts it. The Book of Mormon testifies of the Bible, and both testify of Christ.",1

But as they so ministered they would be providing also new and additional scripture appropriate to the times in which they lived, according to the Lord's pattern.

The prophets of the early Christian church ministered in their day just as the Old Testament prophets did during the preceding centuries. And why? Because they followed this same divine pattern, for as Amos explained, the Lord works only through prophets. (Amos 3:7.)

When there are no prophets, there is no divine direction, and without such guidance the people walk in darkness.

Latter-day Saints value the Bible for many reasons. The Bible presents the revelations of God in several dispensations or eras, each headed by prophets. They also read and follow the Bible for the instructional and spiritual value of the events it describes. While some of the Old Testament describes the Law of Moses that Latter-day Saints believe was fulfilled with the Atonement of Christ (3 Ne. 9:17), nevertheless the Old Testament stories, commandments, ordinances, proverbs, and prophetic writings still express the basic patterns of God's will toward his children and how they should act toward him.

Latter-day Saints revere the New Testament for its account of the birth, ministry, Atonement, and resurrection of the Savior, Jesus Christ. The teachings of Jesus in the New Testament comprise the core of LDS doctrine, and their preeminence is evidenced by their frequent appearance in other LDS standard works accepted as scripture and in LDS speaking and writing.

The writings of the New Testament apostles are accepted and appreciated for their doctrine and wise and inspired counsel and for documenting the apostolic challenge of proclaiming the gospel, adhering to the original teachings of Christ, establishing the unity of the faith, and promoting the righteousness of believers in a rapidly growing Church. Latter-day Saints also find references in several letters of the early apostles of the falling away (see Apostasy) that necessitated the restoration, alerting the faithful to remain fervent and active in the faith and to stay true to the love of Jesus Christ.",1

This is a magnificent Church. Its organization, effectiveness, and sheer goodness are respected by all who sincerely seek to understand it. The Church has programs for children, youth, men, and women. It has beautiful meetinghouses that number more than 18,000. Majestic temples—now totaling 136—dot the earth, with another 30 under construction or announced. A full-time missionary force of over 56,000, comprised of the young and less so, are serving in 150 countries.

(Matt. 28:19.)

The same gifts of the Spirit which prevailed in the church at the time of Jesus are prevalent today. Some of these gifts are: revelation, healing, miracles, prophecy, and many others—as found in First Corinthians, twelfth chapter; Doctrine and Covenants, forty-sixth section; and in the tenth chapter of Moroni in the Book of Mormon. Charity—the pure love of Christ—will be in evidence among its membership.

The same power which Jesus gave to His apostles that ""whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven"" (Matt. 18:18) will also be in the true church today. There are ordinances and blessings bestowed by an authorized ministry to Church members. These covenants and obligations, if entered into and obeyed, apply not just for this life, but for all eternity.

Every individual in the Lord's church is entitled to the sure knowledge, received by personal revelation through the Holy Ghost, that the Church is true. Personal revelation to the individual is the strength of the Church of Jesus Christ in any age.

We must learn the truth for a surety and not merely suppose we are right. It is our responsibility to know—and by the aid of the scriptures and the Holy Ghost one can know without any doubt.

One cannot prayerfully study the scriptures without gaining the knowledge and testimony that there is only one way to exaltation. The scriptures point the way very clearly. It must be God's way and not man's way, for God has said: ""For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord."" (Isa. 55:8.)",2

If truth comes from one source—God—how can it be so diversely taught?

We know that all truth *does* emanate from God and is therefore unchangeable, consistent, and unified. Consequently, not all Christian churches with their dissimilar teachings can provide a fulness of truth. My intent is to assert with testimony and persuasion of scripture the reasons there can be only one Lord, one acceptable faith, one baptism, and one true church. Then if any of you are convinced you are mistaken in your present beliefs, you should have the courage to investigate and the faith to change and follow the true path Christ has outlined that assures one's eternal happiness.

When Jesus walked this earth among men, He proclaimed to His disciples: ""I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."" (John 14:6.) He proclaimed that the doctrines He taught were given to Him by his Father. He took no credit Himself—only that He was doing what the Father had given Him to do. ""For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth."" (John 5:20.)

""I and my Father are one,"" said the Savior. (John 10:30.) This statement does not mean they are one person, but that Jesus and His Father are one in purpose.

To hear and accept Jesus is to hear and accept His Father. Their teachings and objectives are identical. The doctrine of salvation is the same for all of God's progeny. Jesus prayed in His intercessory prayer to His Father concerning those who complied with His doctrines and ordinances: ""And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, *even as we are one.*"" (John 17:22; italics added.)",0

Jesus himself was an apostle through whom God spoke (Heb. 1:2;3:1). The Father sent Jesus, and whoever receives him receives the one who sent him (Mark 9:37; John 8:16-19). As the Father sent him, so Jesus sent his apostles (John 20:21). Initially, they were called from those who ""companied with us [the Twelve] all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us"" (Acts 1:21). The number twelve, associated with the apostles, echoes the number of tribes of Israel whom the apostles are to judge (Matt. 19:28; Luke 22:30). In this connection, they stood as the foundation of the early Christian church (Eph. 2:19-21;4:11-14).

At times, the term embraces more than the Twelve, as is implied both in the phrase ""all the apostles"" (1 Cor. 15:7)-which follows particular mention of ""the Twelve"" by Paul (1 Cor. 15:5)-and in references to persons named as apostles who were known not to be among the Twelve (Acts 14:14; Rom. 16:7). It is probable that by A.D. 54 the Lord's brother James had become one of the Twelve (1 Cor. 15:7; Gal. 1:19). Even so, most New Testament references to apostles refer to members of Jesus' original Twelve or to Paul. They were the guarantors or prime witnesses of Jesus' resurrection, which itself constituted the assurance that he was the expected Messiah and Lord of glory (Acts 1:8-11). In the first century, apostles were traveling witnesses to Jesus' resurrection, sent by him into the world for this purpose (Acts 1:8; cf. Matt. 28:19-20). At the group's core-and the Church's foundation-stood Peter, James, and John, who had been with or near Jesus during critical experiences, including his transfiguration (Mark 9:2-9) and his agony in Gethsemane (Mark 14:32-34).",0

After his ascension, ""they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.

""And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common."" (Acts 4:31–32.)

After the resurrected Savior's ministry among the Nephites, they ""were all converted unto the Lord, upon all the face of the land, both Nephites and Lamanites, and there were no contentions and disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with another.

""*And they had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly gift.""* (4 Ne. 1:2–3; italics added.)

Today *we* are the Church of Christ, and the Lord expects us to come to this same unity. He has said to *us:* ""Be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine."" (D&C 38:27.)

Some members assume that one can be in full harmony with the spirit of the gospel, enjoy full fellowship in the Church, and at the same time be out of harmony with the leaders of the Church and the counsel and direction they give. Such a position is wholly inconsistent, because the guidance of this Church comes not alone from the written word but also from continuous revelation, and the Lord gives that revelation to the Church through his chosen prophet. It follows, therefore, that those who profess to accept the gospel and who at the same time criticize and refuse to follow the counsel of the prophet are assuming an indefensible position. Such a spirit leads to apostasy. It is not new. It was prevalent in the days of Jesus and in the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith.",3

In that same sense, we know nothing but the restoration of the gospel, that it was brought by the Son of Man himself, so that there is no separation from the prophets of this dispensation, and woe be unto us if we share not these marvelous truths with the world!

The Canon is closed. For Latter-day Saints the canon remains open. Scripture is the record of prophetic utterance given under inspiration. There is no final revelation. Revelation in on-going. Neither written scripture, nor natural theology, supersedes the ""living oracles"" (see Religious Experience; Revelation; Scripture).

**CHURCH.** Catholicism and Orthodoxy understand the Church as a ""communion of saints."" The Holy Spirit enlivens the Church with grace empowering it to carry on the work of Christ in history. It is a community of salvation where the Gospel is preached and the sacraments received. Latter-day Saints believe that with the restoration of the higher priesthood came three elements lost from the New Testament Church: (1) organizational patterns and their related offices, including a quorum of twelve apostles; (2) the spirit of prophecy, and all the spiritual gifts; and (3) the temple with its essential ordinances and practices (see Gifts of the Spirit; Organization; Temples). Catholics affirm that grace centers in God's free gift offered through Christ in the sacraments and is infused to the soul. Baptism is essential for salvation. All sacraments are the necessary means of the grace needed for salvation. Mormon rites or ordinances are processes of spiritual rebirth in which the powers of godliness are manifest. They are received by all and all the ordinances are essential to salvation, from baptism to the higher ordinances of the temple. Their efficacy requires proper forms, ordained priesthood authority, and the faith and repentance of the person. There are degrees of salvation and the fulness of salvation or exaltation requires the fulness of the ordinances (see Baptism; Confirmation; Endowment; Temple Ordinances).",3

My response is that we love them as sons and daughters of God. They may have certain inclinations which are powerful and which may be difficult to control. Most people have inclinations of one kind or another at various times. If they do not act upon these inclinations, then they can go forward as do all other members of the Church. If they violate the law of chastity and the moral standards of the Church, then they are subject to the discipline of the Church, just as others are.

We want to help these people, to strengthen them, to assist them with their problems and to help them with their difficulties. But we cannot stand idle if they indulge in immoral activity, if they try to uphold and defend and live in a so-called same-sex marriage situation.

I would like to give a brief synopsis of some of our beliefs to those who are learning about the Church.

The situation of many of you may be like that of my deceased father-in-law, Robert E. Jones, who joined the Church in 1960. He had been raised in a wonderful Christian home, where reading the Bible and adhering to Christian principles were a normal part of family life. At his mother's knee he learned many truths, including the importance of having faith in Jesus Christ and following His example.

As he examined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he was able to retain truths formerly acquired, while enjoying a rich treasure of additional knowledge. I would like to mention 10 points that he understood that can also help you.

1. **God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have a plan of happiness for the human family.**

We proclaim that there truly is a God in heaven and that the human family lived with Him in a premortal existence. We are God's children. He loves us and has prepared a plan whereby through His Son, Jesus Christ, we will enjoy blessings beyond this mortal life. These blessings include an immortal, glorious, resurrected body for all mankind and the opportunity to return to our Heavenly Father's presence as eternal families for those who have faith in Jesus Christ and are obedient to the conditions of His gospel.
2. **Jesus Christ organized His Church during His mortal ministry.**",2

Of course, we take the Bible as our guide to help us in our search for the truth. I have always been greatly impressed by the experience that Elder Orson F. Whitney had. He was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, and he related this in one of our conferences. I would like to read it to you. He said:

""Many years ago a learned man, a member of the Roman Catholic Church, came to Utah and spoke from the stand of the Salt Lake Tabernacle. I became well-acquainted with him, and we conversed freely and frankly. A great scholar, with perhaps a dozen languages at his tongue's end, he seemed to know all about theology, law, literature, science and philosophy. One day he said to me: 'You Mormons are all ignoramuses. You don't even know the strength of your own position. It is so strong that there is only one other tenable in the whole Christian world, and that is the position of the Catholic Church. The issue is between Catholicism and Mormonism. If we are right, you are wrong; if you are right, we are wrong; and that's all there is to it. The Protestants haven't a leg to stand on. For, if we are wrong, they are wrong with us, since they were a part of us and went out from us; while if we are right, they are apostates whom we cut off long ago. If we have the apostolic succession from St. Peter, as we claim, there is no need of Joseph Smith and Mormonism; but if we have not that succession, then such a man as Joseph Smith was necessary, and Mormonism's attitude is the only consistent one. It is either the perpetuation of the gospel from ancient times, or the restoration of the gospel in latter days.'""

Their work was to bring all men to a ""unity of the faith"" regarding Jesus Christ and His teachings (Eph. 4:13).
3. **The Church of Christ and many simple truths were lost.**

Several Bible prophets declared that there would be a ""falling away"" (2 Thes. 2:3) from the true gospel, a time when there would be a ""famine"" (Amos 8:11) regarding the word of God, and ""divisions"" (1 Cor. 11:18) caused as ""grievous wolves"" (Acts 20:29) would enter and disrupt the flock or the people of the Church. These prophecies became a reality when in the years following the Savior's crucifixion, the Apostles were killed, the authority to direct the Church was eventually lost, and for many centuries, including the period known as the Dark Ages, the Church of Jesus Christ was not found on the earth.
4. **The hearts of men and a location were prepared for a restoration of the gospel.**

The closing of the Dark Ages took place as the Reformation unfolded, where brave men and women recognized the need to incorporate doctrines that Jesus had instituted back into the church. We are grateful for the great reformers such as Luther, Wycliffe, Wesley, Tyndale, and many others who helped set the stage for open religious dialogue, study of the scriptures, and the desire engendered in the hearts of good men and women for an expression of religious liberty. But their faith, their desire, their sacrifice, and even their martyrdom were insufficient to restore that which was lost.",1

Latter-day Saints are interested that, in replacing Judas, one apostle was chosen to complete the Twelve and that Peter set the qualifications of apostles: They must know the ministry of Jesus, they must be ordained, and they must be witnesses of his resurrection (Acts 1:21-22). Latter-day apostles in the Church are also ""special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world"" (D&C 107:23; cf. 27:12; 84:108). In addition, the book of Acts indicates the rich outpouring of the Holy Ghost in the early Church, both in the form of guiding revelation and in manifestations of the gifts of the spirit, characteristics that Latter-day Saints experience and value. Further, certain prophetic statements have particular meaning. For example, Latter-day Saints understand Paul's prophecy to the elders of Ephesus concerning mutinous problems within the early Church to be an inspired declaration about the impending apostasy (Acts 20:29-30). Moreover, they view Peter's prediction of Jesus' return from heaven at ""the times of restitution of all things"" as commencing with the latter-day restoration of the gospel (3:19-21). Further, the book of Acts has a good deal to say about the organization, doctrines, and character of the preaching of the early Christian church.

**THE EPISTLES.** Letters in the New Testament are traditionally divided into two groups, the writings of Paul and the general epistles.

The style of Paul's writings varies from the almost formal exposition in Romans to the charming persuasion in Philemon.",0

He prophesied. He taught gospel principles. He translated. He brought forth books of scripture—both ancient and modern. He built temples and cities. He was a revealer of the knowledge of Christ. He was the authorized servant of God. He fulfilled every requirement to complete the profile of a prophet. In due time Joseph received the ""keys of the kingdom."" With this apostolic power he reestablished the true church in its fullness and power. The Lord said to him: ""… this generation shall have my word through you."" (D&C 5:10.)

There is no greater prophet in any dispensation than Joseph Smith. He translated the Book of Mormon from ancient plates. Its purpose is to be another witness that Jesus is the Christ. Concerning this book, the Lord declared: ""And he has translated the book, even that part which I have commanded him, and as your Lord and your God liveth it is true."" (D&C 17:6.)

We know that it is not a popular thing to teach that a backwoods boy from Vermont, reared in New England and trained on the frontier, was a prophet. But, popular or not, it is a fact! *Joseph Smith was a prophet, and all of the calumny and aspersion to the contrary cannot controvert that fact.* Anyone who has concern for the welfare of his eternal soul should give attention to this message. Every man who has lived since the days of Joseph Smith is subject to accepting him as a prophet of God in order to enter into our Heavenly Father's presence.

If you do not know of the divine calling of Joseph Smith, perhaps it is because you have not considered it.

Joseph Smith was the Lord's anointed to restore Christ's Church to the earth. When he emerged from the grove of trees, he eventually learned four fundamental truths not then taught by the majority of the contemporary Christian world.

First, he learned that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, are two separate, distinct beings. The Bible confirms Joseph Smith's discovery. It tells us that the Son submitted His will to the Father (see Matthew 26:42). We are moved by the Savior's submission and find strength in His example to do likewise, but what would have been the depth and passion of Christ's submission or the motivational power of that example if the Father and the Son were the same being and in reality the Son was merely following His own will under a different name?

The scriptures give further evidence of this great truth: ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son"" (John 3:16). A father offering up his only son is the supreme demonstration of love that the human mind and heart can conceive and feel. It is symbolized by the touching story of Abraham and Isaac (see Genesis 22). But if the Father is the same being as the Son, then this sacrifice of all sacrifices is lost, and Abraham is no longer offering up Isaac—Abraham is now offering up Abraham.",3

You must trust that as you consistently live the truth the best you can, They will help you realize the purpose of your earth life and strengthen you to qualify for the blessings promised. To be obedient to the commandments of God requires an understanding of them. It necessitates faith in them. That comprehension is best obtained through personal study of doctrine. That is one of the reasons that in July of this year, President Hinckley and his counselors invited all members to read the Book of Mormon by the end of the year. They promised, ""Those who read the Book of Mormon will be blessed with an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a greater resolve to obey His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God.""5 I have tested and proven that promise in my own life and have confirmed its truth.

As we briefly told of the Restoration and of Joseph Smith, his profile focused in my mind in a most interesting way. It was an unusual experience.

If they could only feel as I feel. If they could know, as I know, if they could only realize the calling and the role of the Prophet.""

I added my witness that Joseph Smith was divinely commissioned as the restorer of the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness, that he was and is a prophet of God, that he sought God in prayer and God spoke to him.

Many of those who dismiss the work of the Restoration simply do not believe that heavenly beings speak to men on earth. Impossible, they say, that golden plates were delivered by an angel and translated by the power of God. From that disbelief, they quickly reject Joseph's testimony, and a few unfortunately sink to discrediting the Prophet's life and slandering his character.

He chose a young man named Joseph Smith to learn about the eternal plan of salvation. Joseph was confused about the different religions in his community, but the scriptures led him to ask God what he should do.7 In answer to his prayer, God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him.8 Through this and other experiences, Joseph Smith was called as a prophet, like unto Moses and other biblical prophets.9 Because Joseph saw and talked with the Savior, his work was to restore the truth about the great plan of God and the divine mission of our Lord. I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.

The Prophet Joseph received authority to teach the gospel and bring forth additional scripture. He was commanded to translate writings of ancient prophets from The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. The Book of Mormon prophets also knew about the plan of salvation and the sacred mission of Jesus Christ. The appearance of the resurrected Christ to the ancient people of the Americas is recorded in this sacred book.10 He taught them His gospel and established His Church among them. I know that the Book of Mormon is another testament of the divinity of Jesus Christ.

God has promised that the Holy Ghost will testify to each of us that sacred truths have been restored and that Joseph Smith was called by God to be a special witness of Christ and His gospel. We may come to know the truth of all things God has revealed, through the power of the Holy Ghost.11

Millions of converts to this Church initially accepted the truths proclaimed by our missionaries in the first discussion.

Joseph was surprised to hear the minister say that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days, that all such things had ceased. (See JS—H 1:21.)

This remark symbolizes practically all of the objections that have ever been made against the Church by nonmembers and dissident members alike. Namely, they do not believe that God reveals his will today to the Church through prophets of God. All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage, seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation. Here, then, is a procedure to handle most objections through the use of the Book of Mormon.

First, understand the objection.

Second, give the answer from revelation.

Third, show how the correctness of the answer really depends on whether or not we have modern revelation through modern prophets.

Fourth, explain that whether or not we have modern prophets and revelation really depends on whether the Book of Mormon is true.

Therefore, the only problem the objector has to resolve for himself is whether the Book of Mormon is true. For if the Book of Mormon is true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a prophet receiving revelation.",0

No modern prophet like Joseph Smith or Brigham Young is ever worshiped or prayed to.""

I went on further to explain that the temple in Salt Lake City is not to honor the Prophet Joseph, nor is he even buried there.

I have seemed to have the Prophet Joseph in my mind the last few months. I've sat and contemplated his glorious responsibility in becoming the prophet of this, the dispensation of the fulness of times.

I think how grateful we are as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that Joseph Smith, a boy who desired to know what he needed to do to have his sins forgiven, found the courage to go into a grove of trees near his home in Palmyra, New York, and there kneel in prayer and—by his own statement—pray out loud for the first time (see Joseph Smith—History 1:14).

On that occasion, as Joseph got on his knees in what we call the Sacred Grove, the heavens opened. Two personages, brighter than the noonday sun, appeared before him. One spoke to him and said, ""[Joseph,] this is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!"" (Joseph Smith—History 1:17). Thus began the Restoration of the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ.

Because Jesus, our Savior and our Redeemer, spoke to the boy Joseph and opened up this dispensation of time that we now live in, we sing, ""Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah!"" (""Praise to the Man,"" Hymns, no. 27). We thank the Lord for Joseph Smith and for his courage to go into that grove of trees in 1820, near his home in Palmyra, New York.

I've been thinking about all of the marvelous things that we know and all of the things that we have. My beloved brothers and sisters, my testimony to you this morning is how abundantly blessed we are to know all that we know because we have Joseph Smith, the prophet of this last dispensation of time.",2

In our day the same approach is made by ill-disposed persons to the name of Joseph Smith. The way men feel about him and his prophetic successors divides true believers from those who serve another master.

Unto Joseph Smith, seer of latter days, the Lord of heaven spoke these words: ""The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee;

""While the pure in heart, and the wise, and the noble, and the virtuous, shall seek counsel, and authority, and blessings constantly from under thy hand."" (D&C 122:1–2.)

Why will it ever be thus? Because Joseph Smith is the restorer of the knowledge of Christ and of salvation; because he translated the Book of Mormon, which contains the fulness of the gospel; because he received revelations as numerous and glorious as those given to Moses and Isaiah; because angelic ministrants gave him keys and powers and priesthoods, which enabled him and his successors to bind on earth and have their acts sealed everlastingly in the heavens—all these are but a few of the reasons why we honor the name of Joseph Smith.

I, for one, want to seek counsel, and authority, and blessings constantly from the hands of such a man!

Most importantly, do as young Joseph and ""ask … God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given [you].""17 This is not only how you may learn the truth about the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith; it is also the pattern to know the truth of all things.18

Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, as is Thomas S. Monson today. Through Joseph Smith, ""the keys of the kingdom of God are [again] committed unto man on the earth, and … the gospel [will] roll forth … as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands … , until it has filled the whole earth.""19

God is our Eternal Father, and Jesus is the Christ. We worship Them. Nothing compares with Their creations, the plan of salvation, and the atoning sacrifice of the Lamb of God.

Smith was five years old when his father, Hyrum, was killed in Carthage Jail. Later, Joseph crossed the plains with his widowed mother.

At age 15 he was called on a mission to Hawaii. He felt lost and alone and said: ""I was very much oppressed. … I felt as if I was so debased in my condition of poverty, lack of intelligence and knowledge, just a boy, that I hardly dared look [anyone] in the face.""

While pondering his plight one night, young Joseph dreamed he was on a journey, rushing as fast as he possibly could. He carried with him a small bundle. Finally, he came to a wonderful mansion, which was his destination. As he approached, he saw a sign which read, ""Bath."" He quickly went in and washed himself. He opened his little bundle and found clean white clothing—""a thing,"" he said, ""I had not seen for a long time."" He put them on and rushed to the door of the mansion.

""I knocked,"" he said, ""and the door opened, and the man who stood there was the Prophet Joseph Smith. He looked at me a little reprovingly, and the first words he said [were]: 'Joseph, you are late.' Yet I took confidence and said:

""'Yes, but I am clean—I am clean!'""8

And so it can be for each of us.

If you are set on a course of faith and activity in the Church, stay on course and keep your covenants. Continue forward until the time when the Lord's blessings will come to you and the Holy Ghost will be revealed as a moving force in your life.

If you are presently on a course that points away from the one outlined in the scriptures, let me assure you there is a way back.

Jesus Christ has prescribed a very clear method for us to repent and find healing in our lives. The cure for most mistakes can be found by seeking forgiveness through personal prayer. However, there are certain spiritual illnesses, particularly those dealing with violations of the moral law, which absolutely require the assistance and treatment of a qualified spiritual physician.",2

With the knowledge that we can converse with God as one man converses with another, we also understand that we not only have a divine spark within us, but that we are actually spirit children of our Father in heaven.

Prayer, being the primary method of communication between God and man, plays an important part in practically every religion, whether Christian or otherwise. This is particularly true in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Prayer opened the heavens to the Prophet Joseph Smith and thus opened the dispensation of the fulness of times. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is truly a monument to prayer.

I am most grateful to the Prophet Joseph Smith for his simple belief in prayer. The answer to his prayer restored light and truth to mankind regarding the Godhead and many other great truths.

I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God, and that through him the power to act in the name of God has been restored to the earth.

Through Joseph Smith have been restored all the powers, keys, teachings, and ordinances necessary for salvation and exaltation. You cannot go anywhere else in the world and get that. It is not to be found in any other church. It is not to be found in any philosophy of man or scientific digest or individual pilgrimage, however intellectual it may seem.

Rather, it requires a greater obligation to invoke the essence of the gospel of Christ in our lives—to love, serve, and bless others. Indeed, as the First Presidency stated in 1978, we believe that ""the great religious leaders of the world such as Mohammed, Confucius, and the Reformers, as well as philosophers including Socrates, Plato, and others, received a portion of God's light.

* God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are separate beings.5
* You are more than human. You are a child of God the Eternal Father and may become like Him6 if you will have faith in His Son, repent, receive ordinances, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end.7
* The Church of Jesus Christ today is fundamentally the same Church He organized during His mortal ministry, with prophets and apostles, Melchizedek and Levitical Priesthoods, elders, high priests, deacons, teachers, bishops, and the seventy, all as described in the Bible.
* Priesthood authority was withheld from the earth following the deaths of the Savior and His Apostles and was restored again in our day.
* Revelation has not ceased, and the heavens are not closed. God speaks to prophets today, and He will speak to you and me as well.8
* There is more after this life than only heaven and hell. There are degrees of glory, and it matters a great deal what we do in this life.9
* More than having a mere passive belief in Christ, we should ""look unto [Him] in every thought,""10 ""do all that [we do] in the name of the Son,""11 and ""always remember him and keep his commandments … that [we] may always have his Spirit to be with [us].""12
* The billions who live and die without the gospel and the ordinances necessary for salvation are not lost. ""Through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel,""13 administered for both the living and the dead.14

No, these sections do not ""ban polygamy,"" and one of them, Section 101, wasn't even a revelation.

What was then D&C 13:7 in the 1835 edition is now D&C 42:22. (This link is super helpful for figuring out this kind of thing, btw.) The context of the section—again, important, and again, missing from Jeremy's commentary—shows that it's talking about adultery and fornication, not plural marriage. The entire section is talking about the laws and commandments of the newly reestablished Church, and this is referring to the law of chastity. Practicing plural marriage when commanded to is not violating the law of chastity. The commandment to cleave unto your wife and none else does not preclude another commandment telling you to have more than one wife to cleave to. If you have more than one wife, you can cleave to all of them and not be in violation of this commandment.

The 1835 D&C 65:3 is now D&C 49:15-21. This revelation was given in 1831 and was in direct response to the Shakers and their belief in abstinence and celibacy, including that all marriage was wrong. Some of the new converts to the Church were former Shakers and still held onto those old beliefs. The Lord was saying that marriage is ordained of God and that they should engage in it. In 1831, the practice of the Church was that of monogamy. That's always been the norm, even when plural marriage was in force. That is the standard by which we all live unless commanded otherwise. That command to live otherwise hadn't yet gone into effect. Joseph may have known about it at this point, but he wasn't living it yet and neither was anyone else. Again, these verses were not banning polygamy, they were giving instructions on how to marry and conduct yourselves in marriage to Saints who didn't believe in marriage, as well as pointing out other things the Shakers got wrong.",2

I'm sure you all do, too. Some people really, really struggle with this doctrine. It's one I personally developed a testimony of about ten years ago, but I had very conflicted feelings over it before then. It's still not something I'd be happy to live and I'm incredibly grateful that I live in a time when I don't have to, at least in this lifetime. I do firmly believe that it did come from God, but it's complicated and messy. I can't give anyone a testimony or make anyone believe the way I do. Everyone needs to resolve that question for themselves.

What I *can* do is help clarify some of the history and some of the doctrinal reasons that were given for its implementation. I can point you toward research done by people much smarter than I am. I can respond to Faulk's claims with the same level of scrutiny I've given his other claims. And I can discuss this topic openly and honestly, the way I always try to, and not shy away from those messy, complicated aspects of the practice.

I'm biased—I'm telling you right up front that I believe this practice was instituted by God. Thomas Faulk is biased, too. He believes it *wasn't* instituted by God. But you shouldn't take either of us at our word. Put in the work and do the research, and most importantly, pray to Heavenly Father. Tell Him how you feel about it, and ask Him for guidance, understanding, and clarification. It's what I did, and it's the best advice I can give: develop your own testimony. Don't rely on mine or your spouse's or your parents', or anyone else's for that matter. Obtain your own, and maintain and grow it over time. Let the Holy Ghost work on you. Let Him teach you. It's why He's there.",2

This revelation also taught that under certain conditions a man might be authorized to have more than one wife. Though the revelation was first committed to writing on July 12, 1843, considerable evidence suggests that the principle of plural marriage was revealed to Joseph Smith more than a decade before in connection with his study of the Bible (see* Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible (JST) ""Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible (JST)"")*), probably in early 1831. Passages indicating that revered Patriarchs and prophets of old were polygamists raised questions that prompted the Prophet to inquire of the Lord about marriage in general and about plurality of wives in particular. He then learned that when the Lord commanded it, as he had with the Patriarchs anciently, a man could have more than one living wife at a time and not be condemned for adultery. He also understood that the Church would one day be required to live the law (* D&C 132*:1-4, 28-40).*

Evidence for the practice of plural marriage during the 1830s is scant. Only a few knew about the still unwritten revelation, and perhaps the only known plural marriage was that between Joseph Smith and Fanny Alger. Nonetheless there were rumors, harbingers of challenges to come.",3

Jacob taught, ""David and Solomon had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord"" (Jacob 2:24). In the same discourse, Jacob established that monogamous marriage was the rule in God's kingdom, while plural marriage was an exception granted under unusual circumstances. He specified:

From a reading of the entire scriptural canon, it appears that plural marriage is an exception and not the general rule concerning marriage relationships on earth and in the eternities. When the question of plural marriage was raised among the Nephites, Jacob condemned the practice but also noted the Lord's word to him that ""if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things"" (Jacob 2:30). This verse allows for righteous men, such as the biblical patriarch Jacob (Israel), Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and others to practice plural marriage when it is commanded, but for most of the history of the Church, monogamous marriages have been the common practice among the Saints.

Many Church members struggled to accept the revelation to end plural marriage. Church leaders worked to help the Saints understand the change and were gentle in their treatment of those who struggled with the Manifesto. Official Declaration 1 proclaimed that President Woodruff's ""advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land"" (Official Declaration 1). It left open the question of whether the practice might continue in countries, such as Mexico, where no laws existed that prohibited plural marriage.",3

The only man and woman that becomes God and Sons of God is those who enter into polygamy, and they may enter into the presence of Father and Son and they will have their servants around them, but they will never reign and be kings, as those that have the privilege of the blessings and refuse to accept them.*

I have thought for many years that the connections between man and wife were as sacred as the heavens and ought to be treated as such, and I thought that the anointed of the Lord would not get more wives unless they were commanded to do so. But still I wanted a knowledge of the truth for myself. I asked my husband if he did not think we could get a revelation for ourselves on that subject. He said he did not know. After we went to bed I lay pondering it over in my mind. I said, ""You know, Lord, that I have been a faithful and true wife to my husband, and you know how much I love him, and must I sacrifice him?"" The answer was, ""No.""*

It was too sacred for fools to handle, for they would use it to gratify their lustful desires. How thankful we ought to be that we live in a day when we can know the will of God concerning our duty, and that the darkness that has so long covered the earth has been dispelled and the light of truth has burst upon the benighted world. But what good will this do those who will not come to the light because their deeds are evil, and they choose darkness rather than light. But the honest in heart that seek the Lord in faith will obtain all the knowledge needful for their salvation. I have seen so much wrong connected with this ordinance that **had I not had it revealed to me from Him that cannot lie, I should sometimes have doubted the truth of it, but there has never a doubt crossed my mind concerning the truth of it since the Lord made it known to me by a heavenly vision**.*

Jacob delivered a condemnatory speech at the temple where he chastised the Nephites for their ""wickedness and abominations"" (Jacob 2:10), specifically their pride (Jacob 2:13, 16, 20, 22), materialism (Jacob 2:13, 17–19), and sexual immorality (Jacob 2:23–35).

Concerning their ""whoredoms"" (Jacob 2:23, 28, 33), Jacob specifically mentioned unauthorized polygamy as an iniquitous practice. ""Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord. . . . Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old"" (Jacob 2:24, 26). Jacob therefore categorized such unauthorized instances of polygyny and concubinage (a man marrying multiple women), as sinful, for, he said, God ""delight[s] in the chastity of women"" (Jacob 2:28), and would not tolerate lascivious men abusing women (Jacob 2:32–33).

That being the general rule, Jacob went on to qualify that law, saying that plural marriage is justifiable but only when God commands it. ""Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes. For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things"" (Jacob 2:29–30).

Therefore, the question in this case is likely not what his motivation was. It should be whether or not you believe him when you hear his motivation.

As I said above, this is a question I took directly to Heavenly Father. I put aside my personal assumptions and I asked Him if it was a commandment from Him, and if it was, to open my mind and give me understanding and insight as to *why* it was a commandment. Because I did that, I can say that yes, I believe Joseph when I hear what his motivation was, according to those who knew him and the revelation he received.

He has them mourning, as though their marriages were equal to a death. In verse 33 he says that the daughters should not be led away captive. It is difficult to know how these verses are to be read. Were the women coerced into the marriages? There is insufficient evidence to tell.

What we can do, however, is look at the interesting combination of the two sins that were so great that they initiated this sermon. The first was pride through wealth and the second is having multiple wives. Why were these seemingly different sins grouped together?

The answer is speculative, but based on the events occurring in the New World in the region, and at the time, that we believe Book of Mormon peoples lived in that region. Economic development requires that there be an excess production of some desirable good which may be exchanged with someone else. The popularity of the exchange would increase the demand, and those who can produce more are able to trade for more. Although this image is from a monetized society, the more you sell, the more money you make.

At that time, there were people who were creating trade goods, and, as Jacob indicated, gathering wealth. The key to wealth was production, and at this early stage production was a family business. Thus, the more hands, the more product. In the history of the early Maya region, those hands were supplied by multiple wives and the larger number of children available. Therefore, in that time and place, these two incipient sins were precisely the sins most widespread and developing in multiple societies. Since trade would typically be outside the community, those ideas were clearly affecting the way the Nephites saw themselves and what was desirable.",1

Welch Notes - Come Follow Me - 478,4,"Mosiah 11:2 — Noah Had Many Wives and Concubines In Noah's mind, the question may well have been, when Lehi commanded his sons not to have more than one wife, was that binding on all of Lehi's posterity forever, or was it only binding on his sons? In the ancient world, fathers had the right to arrange marriages and to lay down the conditions of marriage for their sons and daughters. Any righteous person following Lehi as a prophet would certainly say that Father Lehi did not think this was a good idea, unless God should command otherwise, and thus people generally should not do this either (Jacob 2:27). However, if Noah wanted to justify himself, he could certainly have argued that Lehi was only speaking as a father binding his immediate sons, not his distant posterity.
In fact, under the Law of Moses—which Noah's priests said they were strictly obeying— the book of Deuteronomy makes it is very clear that an Israelite man could have more than one wife. If a man was married and his brother died, he could be required under the law of levirate marriage to take his deceased brother's wife as a second wife. The law also goes on to provide that the oldest son of a first wife was to be privileged and protected in getting a double portion in the distribution of his deceased father's inheritance among all his sons. Thus, for example, a man could not prefer the first son of his second wife in his estate planning and give that son a double portion of the standard share of the inheritance (Deuteronomy 21:15–17).",0

Kimball were exceptions. Sometimes the wives simply shared homes, each with her own bedroom, or lived in a ""duplex"" arrangement, each with a mirror-image half of the house. In other cases, husbands established separate homes for their wives, sometimes in separate towns. Although circumstances and the mechanics of family life varied, in general the living style was simply an adaptation of the nineteenth century American family. Polygamous marriages were similar to national norms in fertility and divorce rates as well. Wives of one husband often developed strong bonds of sisterly love; however, strong antipathies could also arise between wives.

Faced with a national antipolygamy campaign, LDS women startled their eastern sisters, who equated polygamy with oppression of women, by publicly demonstrating in favor of their right to live plural marriage as a religious principle. Judging from the preaching, women were at least as willing to enter plural marriage as men. Instead of public admonitions urging women to enter plural marriage, one finds many urging worthy men to ""do their duty"" and undertake to care for a plural wife and additional children. Though some were reluctant to accept such responsibility, many responded and sought another wife. It was not unheard of for a wife to take the lead and insist that her husband take another wife; yet, in other cases, a first marriage dissolved over the husband's insistence on marrying again.",1

People often then point to Joseph's lack of children with his plural wives and say, ""Oh, really? Then explain this!"" as if they're somehow contradictory. But they aren't. While yes, some of the early Saints did have large numbers of children with their plural wives, many more did not. The vast majority of people living this law belonged to families with 2-3 wives, not dozens. Their families were larger than average, but not hugely so. It wasn't necessarily about *numbers* of righteous Saints as it was about *strength* and *unity*.

Gregory Smith explains:

> *Some Church members have presumed that polygamy was thus designed to ensure a larger number of descendants than would be possible under monogamy. This need not be the case: polygamy was, as we have seen, an effective tool for ""winnowing."" Any family willing to make the sacrifices attendant to plural marriage were unreservedly dedicated to the restored gospel. Children raised in such an environment can have had no doubt, from an early age, of their parents' convictions. This effect can only have been magnified by the fact that most Church leaders were in polygamous unions.*

There's that careful wording again. Notice the use of the word ""but"" in reference to women, but not to men. Women are therefore explicitly prohibited from having more than one husband, while men ""should have one wife,"" without the explicit prohibition of having more than one. Also keep in mind that plural marriage, at least in the minds of the Saints, was not ""polygamy"" as understood by 19th Century folk – i.e. harems and concubines and seraglios. Even after plural marriage became public, the Utah saints went out of their way to distance themselves from those kinds of practices. This revelation is trying to put some distance between those two versions of polygyny, which, in practice, really were quite different from each other.

1835 Doctrine & Covenants 13:7: ""Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shall cleave unto her and none else.""

The Lord speaks of Abraham, David, Solomon, and Moses as having ""wives and concubines"" (D&C 132:37–39). A concubine was seen as a secondary wife. One biblical scholar has noted, ""The biblical narratives demonstrate that another major motivating factor [for plural marriage] was the securing of offspring.""12 For instance, the form of plural marriage practiced by Abraham appears to have been an exception to the law of marriage that a man should have one wife (D&C 49:16; Jacob 2:27–30). He acted so that he could secure his posterity (see Genesis 15).

Abraham's engagement in the practice of plural marriage took place under the guiding hand of revelation. Joseph Smith taught, ""Abraham was guided in all his family affairs by the Lord; was told where to go, and when to stop; was conversed with by angels, and by the Lord; and prospered exceedingly in all that he put his hand unto; it was because he and his family obeyed the counsel of the Lord.""13 The practice of concubinage is mentioned in Doctrine and Covenants 132, but it was part of the cultural environment of the early biblical period, not part of marriage relationships in the eternities.14",2

Interestingly, this passage also links the polygamy of Noah and his priests with wealth and economic exploitation (Mosiah 11:3, 6). This clearly indicates that Jacob anticipated (unfortunately correctly) that these practices would be a problem for later generations, particularly in his very city, the city of Nephi.

In our own day, prophets are needed to reveal or clarify when God authorizes certain practices and how He wants those practices to be conducted. In the case of plural marriage, ""The Bible and the Book of Mormon teach that monogamy is God's standard for marriage unless He declares otherwise"" (Official Declaration 1 heading), or, in Jacob's language, ""if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people [to practice plural marriage]; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things [i.e. the commandment to be married and have sexual relations with only one wife]"" (Jacob 2:30; 3:5).",2

First, plural marriage is biblical. It was practiced by the men and women in the early histories of Genesis as a way of fulfilling the Lord's promises to them of a posterity ""as innumerable as the stars"" (Genesis 15:5; 22:17–18; 26:4; Abraham 3:14; D&C 132:30). Abraham, considered the father of the faithful, practiced plural marriage. The Savior Himself taught that Abraham was one of the few people, along with Isaac and Jacob, who were already in the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 8:11; Luke 16:22). Anyone who reads the scriptures seriously has to reckon with the exalted status of Abraham, a righteous man who also practiced plural marriage.

It is also fitting that the Lord invoked the example of Abraham in section 132 because it appears that one of the primary purposes of commanding the early Saints to practice plural marriage was to test their faithfulness. Abraham underwent a painfully severe test—he was commanded to sacrifice his son, Isaac (Genesis 22; D&C 132:36). The men and women of the early Restoration lived in a period in which chastity and fidelity were held in high esteem. Asking these people to enter into a new system of marriage was an Abrahamic test of sorts. Brigham Young, who was one of the most ardent defenders of plural marriage in his later life, recalled, ""My brethren know what my feelings were at the time Joseph revealed the doctrine; I was not desirous of shrinking from any duty, nor of failing in the least to do as I was commanded, but it was the first time in my life that I had desired the grave, and I could hardly get over it for a long time. And when I saw a funeral, I felt to envy the corpse [and] its situation, and to regret that I was not in the coffin.""8",3

Hinckley upheld the teachings of Official Declaration 1, declaring, ""If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose. Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this Church."" President Hinckley also added, ""More than a century ago God clearly revealed unto His prophet Wilford Woodruff that the practice of plural marriage should be discontinued, which means that it is now against the law of God. Even in countries where civil or religious law allows polygamy, the Church teaches that marriage must be monogamous and does not accept into its membership those practicing plural marriage.""3

Plural marriage is an important part of the history of the Church. It played the role it was intended to play and then God instructed the President of the Church to end the practice. An official statement of the Church on the subject declares, ""Marriage between one man and one woman is God's standard for marriage, unless He declares otherwise, which He did through His prophet, Joseph Smith. The Manifesto marked the beginning of the return to monogamy, which is the standard of the Church today.""4

It brings to my mind when the Savior was trying to teach His Apostles about His upcoming execution and they refused to listen to Him, too. There are other similarities I see between Joseph's situation and Christ's earthly trouble—the elements of conspiracy against them, the charges of treason, etc.

According to Smith:

> *Joseph considered the doctrine essential for the Church, and it would seem that he offered the Church members at least one public opportunity to hear about plural marriage, but they refused it. So, Joseph continued to teach the doctrine, but in private. Are other more faithful members to be forbidden knowledge which some refused to receive?*
>
>
> *In the last years of his life, Joseph repeatedly bemoaned the fact that all the members would not accept that which he wanted to teach. … Joseph noted in 1843 that ""many seal up the door of heaven by saying so far God may reveal and I will believe but no further.""*
>
>
> *These factors add a new moral wrinkle to the issue: what is a prophet to do if the majority of people are not yet ready to accept a teaching? Should he announce it publicly anyway, risking the wrath of violent opponents who will seek to prevent him from teaching anything at all? Should he teach nothing, and allow the less-faithful to decide that the more-faithful may not enjoy revelation from God? Or, should he opt for Joseph's approach—keep the doctrine private, and introduce it as people will accept it?*

The teachings of Christ must be embedded in our desire to choose the right and in our wish to find happiness. His righteous life must be reflected in our own actions. The Lord not only teaches love, He *is* love. He not only preached the importance of faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, He *lived* accordingly. His life reflected the gospel that He preached. There was and is total harmony between His thoughts and His actions.

I believe that if we want to be true Christians, our lives must be founded on true principles and our actions must reflect that. But I do not believe that we can pick and choose which principles are the most convenient ones. Today, however, I would like to mention those that are true to my heart and that have helped me in my quest to take the Christian course.

When a man asked Christ what he should do to inherit eternal life, He answered, ""Love the Lord thy God … and thy neighbour as thyself."" (Luke 10:27.) Love is the essence of the gospel and the guiding light for a Christlike life. It not only teaches us to look upward but also to look around us. Our heart, might, and mind must be dedicated to the Lord and to our fellow men, women, and children. But what does that really mean? It means that we follow the admonition of the scripture, ""If ye love me, keep my commandments."" (John 14:15.) It means that we live the example of the good Samaritan, who was free of prejudice and excuses and therefore truly loved his neighbor. He went the second mile and gave of what he had despite all the odds. His life was one of single-minded service.",0

The harmful effects of ethyl alcohol (the active ingredient in all alcoholic beverages) on human health are also noted in the Bible (Prov. 31:4-5; Isa. 5:11).

Be clean in mind, and then you will have greater control over your bodies. It was said of old, ""As [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he"" (Prov. 23:7). Unclean thoughts lead to unclean acts.

I remember going to President McKay years ago to plead the cause of a missionary who had become involved in serious sin. I said to President McKay, ""He did it on an impulse."" The President said to me: ""His mind was dwelling on these things before he transgressed. The thought was father to the deed. There would not have been that impulse if he had previously controlled his thoughts.""",3

2. The ministry of Christ in the spirit world was for the benefit of those who had died without hearing the gospel or the fulness of it (1 Pet. 4:6; see Salvation of the Dead).

3. Such baptisms are to be performed in temple fonts dedicated to the purpose (*TPJS*, p. 308; cf. D&C 124:29-35). In November 1841 the font in the unfinished Nauvoo Temple was so dedicated.

4. The language of the baptismal prayer is the same as for the living, with the addition of ""for and in behalf of"" the deceased.

5. Witnesses are to be present for proxy baptisms and a record is to be kept in Church archives (D&C 128:3, 8).

6. Women are to be baptized for women and men for men.

7. Not only baptism but confirmation and the higher temple ordinances may also be performed by proxy (*TPJS*, pp. 362-63).

8. The law of agency is inviolate in this world and the world to come. Thus, those served by proxy have the right to accept or reject the ordinances.

In the early years of the Church, proxy baptisms were performed only for direct blood ancestors, usually no more than four generations back. Today, Latter-day Saints are baptized not only for their own forebears but also for other persons, unrelated to them, identified through the name extraction program. The practice reflects the yearning of children for their parents and of parents for their children, and charitable feelings for others as well, that they receive the fulness of the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ. In LDS perspective, whatever else one may do to mourn, give honorable burial to, cherish, or memorialize the dead, this divinely authorized ordinance of baptism is a demonstration of love and has eternal implications.",2

In modern times, this ordinance and the authority to perform it has been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith and is performed in temples throughout the world. Baptism and other essential, saving ordinances are performed for those who were unable or unwilling to accept them in this life but might do so on the other side of the veil so they, too, might ""live according to God in the spirit"" (1 Peter 4:6).

The first public affirmation of the ordinance of baptism for the dead in the Church was Joseph Smith's funeral sermon for Seymour Brunson in Nauvoo in August 1840.

Jesus taught that all must be baptized to enter heaven, the problem is that there are millions of God's children who never have even heard the name of Jesus, yet alone had the opportunity to be baptized. According to many churches, these people will be condemned for the eternities because of something that is completely out of their control, that of learning about and accepting Christ through baptism.

We believe that God is a merciful God. Because he loves all of his children, he created a plan for those who never have had the opportunity to accept Jesus Christ and be baptized in this life. Those who die before hearing the gospel will have the chance to hear about Christ after they have died. These children of God will then have the chance to accept or reject the message of the Savior, and then those on the earth can be baptized for and in behalf of them in temples of the Lord. The baptism is only valid if the deceased person accepts the ordinance. The act of baptism for the dead is an act of compassion, not a way to force someone to believe. It is God's way of allowing all to be baptized and to receive the blessings of the gospel, even if they have never had the opportunity in this life.",2

Smith witnessed in vision that the Savior visited the spirit world and ""from among the righteous [spirits] … organized his forces and appointed messengers, clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness. …

""These were taught faith in God, repentance from sin, vicarious baptism for the remission of sins, [and] the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.""5

The doctrine that the living can provide baptism and other essential ordinances to the dead, vicariously, was revealed anew to the Prophet Joseph Smith.6 He learned that the spirits awaiting resurrection are not only offered individual salvation but that they can be bound in heaven as husband and wife and be sealed to their fathers and mothers of all generations past and have sealed to them their children of all generations future. The Lord instructed the Prophet that these sacred rites are appropriately performed only in a house built to His name, a temple.7

The principle of vicarious service should not seem strange to any Christian. In the baptism of a living person, the officiator acts, by proxy, in place of the Savior. And is it not the central tenet of our faith that Christ's sacrifice atones for our sins by vicariously satisfying the demands of justice for us? As President Gordon B.

Latter-day Saints believe that proxy baptism for the dead should be performed vicariously (1 Cor. 15:29; D&C 124:28-35, 127-128), and that it becomes effective if the deceased beneficiary accepts the gospel while in the spirit world awaiting resurrection (see 1 Pet. 3:18-20;4:6; cf.

This appears to be especially the case with ordinances performed on behalf of the dead. David L. Paulsen and Brock M. Mason observed that ""nearly all the texts purporting to contain teachings of Christ concerning salvation for the dead emphasize that his teachings were closely guarded, reserved only for those whom the Lord deemed worthy to hear them.""11: 39. See also Nibley, ""Baptism for the Dead,"" 113–114. Many of these texts are part of the so-called forty-day literature.

The sacred silence placed upon this doctrine and these ordinances, then, limits the source material available to modern scholars for study.

When Clement, as an investigator, asked Peter, ""If those shall enjoy the kingdom of Christ, whom His coming shall find righteous, shall then those be wholly deprived of the kingdom who have died before His coming?"" Peter with reticence described the sacred nature of ordinances for the dead: ""You compel me, O Clement, to touch upon things that are unspeakable. But so far as it is allowed to declare them, I shall not shrink from doing so.""12 According to Hugh Nibley, this reticence reflects the ""occasions Peter and other apostles are forbidden to talk about certain things"" in the New Testament.13, 104."") This is especially evident in the bestowal of the apostolic keys upon Peter, giving him power over the gates of hell—that is, the realm of the dead—during which Jesus ""gave a watchword"" to His Apostles ""not to tell it to any man.""14",3

Regarding this principle, Paulsen et al., ""Baptism for the Dead,"" 31, note: ""Paul's failure to openly condemn the practice was in effect an endorsement of the same. It has been asserted that Paul's lack of condemnation on the subject has a parallel to Paul's initial unwillingness to condemn the practice of eating meat sacrificed to idols (1 Corinthians 8:10). But the parallel is weak, since Paul does state explicitly later in the same epistle that such a practice is inherently wrong (1 Corinthians 10:21).

In this masterful letter to friends he had lived with for a year and a half, Paul corrected many incorrect beliefs and practices that had crept into the fledgling branch of the Church there, including some incorrect beliefs about the Resurrection. Paul emphasized that like Christ, everyone would be resurrected into a kingdom of glory. In this context, Paul is using baptisms for the dead to ultimately strengthen his argument in favor of the resurrection of the dead—showing that he understood and approved of the practice. Baptism is still a requirement to enter the kingdom of heaven (see John 3:5), and those who died without being able to receive this ordinance would then depend on living individuals to perform these ordinances as a proxy for them.",3

Peterson has observed that ""several logical fallacies exist"" in such an approach, especially regarding other ordinances such as the sacrament that were likewise accepted by these sects as well as the orthodox church.18, 395–431; and D. Jill Kirby, ""Living in the Afterlife: Heaven, Hell, and Places Between,"" in Ancient Christians, 392–449."")

After regarding these later theological developments, Krister Stendahl, the late Bishop of Stockholm for the Church of Sweden, noted: ""Once the theological pressures from later possible developments of practice and doctrine are felt less constricting, the text [1 Corinthians 15:29] seems to speak plainly enough about a practice within the Church of vicarious baptism for the dead.""19, 1:97. For another Christian supporter of early Christians securing salvation for deceased loved ones, see the Hans A. Pohlsander, review of Rescue for the Dead: The Posthumous Salvation of Non-Christians in Early Christianity, by Jeffrey A. Trumbower, BYU Studies Quarterly 41, no. 2 (2002): 187–191."")

As additional texts have come to light, however, most scholars today conclude that the clearest reading of this verse states that early Christians actually performed vicarious ordinances for the dead.

For example, after reviewing attempts to interpret this passage as referring to a metaphor or a regular baptism, one scholar concluded that ""all interpretations which seek to evade vicarious baptism for the dead … are misleading.""4, 1:542n63."") Similarly, Reginald St. John Parry noted that ""the plain and necessary sense of the words implies the existence of a practice of vicarious baptism at Corinth, presumably on behalf of believers who died before they were baptised. … Many attempts have been made to evade this conclusion, but all at the cost of violence to the language. … In fact, all such evasions are wholly due to the unwillingness to admit such a practice, and still more such a reference to it by S.

He found much evidence to support this doctrine which caused Paul to write in an epistle to the Corinthians:

""Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?"" (1 Cor. 15:29.)

Peter answered that question in these words:

""For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit"" (1 Pet. 4:6).

We know by the scriptures that the gospel is preached to the dead and the dead are to be judged according to men in the flesh and live according to God in the spirit. Thus baptism is necessary for those who, during their lifetime, had not opportunity for this ordinance of baptism by immersion for the remission of sin.

Only in the Church of Jesus Christ do we find temple work which is performed for the living and vicariously for the dead, who rely on us for the performance of this work on behalf of those who cannot do it for themselves, even as we relied on Christ to do for us what we could not do for ourselves.

During this interview, baptismal candidates are asked whether they have a heartfelt testimony of the fundamental doctrine of the Church. All baptismal candidates also must declare whether they currently keep, and will continue to keep, God's commandments through their lives.

Baptism is required for Church membership. It represents a covenant with God whereby the candidate agrees to follow Christ and live his commandments. The requirements for baptism are described in the Doctrine and Covenants as follows: ""All those who humble themselves before God, and desire to be baptized, and come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, and witness before the church that they have truly repented of all their sins, and are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end, and truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins, shall be received by baptism into his church"" (D&C 20:37). Baptism symbolizes the washing away of sins as well as a rebirth and the beginning of a new life on earth leading to eternal life with God.

Baptism is followed by confirmation into the Church by the laying on of hands of one holding the Melchizedek Priesthood. During this ordinance, the new convert is confirmed a member of the Church and receives the gift of the Holy Ghost. This is typically a momentous and joyous occasion for all involved. Following his confirmation the convert is presented for acceptance by the local membership as a member in full fellowship and embarks on a life of spiritual growth through obedience to the laws of God and activity and service in the Church.",1

Latter-day Saints believe, as do many Christians, that baptism is an essential initiatory ordinance for all persons who are joining the Church, as it admits them to Christ's church on earth (John 3:3-5; D&C 20:37, 68-74). It is a primary step in the process, which includes faith, repentance, baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end, whereby members may receive remission of their sins and gain access to the Celestial Kingdom and eternal life (e.g., Mark 16:15-16; 2 Ne. 31:13-21; D&C 22:1-4;84:64, 74; *MD*, pp. 69-72).

Latter-day Saint baptisms are performed for converts who have been properly instructed, and are at least eight years of age (the age of accountability). Baptism must be performed by one who has proper priesthood authority. The major features of the ordinance include the raising of the right hand, the reciting of the prescribed baptismal prayer by the one performing the baptism, and the complete immersion of the candidate (3 Ne. 11:23-26; D&C 20:71-74;68:27). Baptism symbolizes the covenant by which people promise to come into the fold of God, to take upon themselves the name of Christ, to stand as a witness for God, to keep his commandments, and to bear one another's burdens, manifesting a determination to serve him to the end, and to prepare to receive the spirit of Christ for the remission of sins. The Lord, as his part of the covenant, is to pour out his spirit upon them, redeem them from their sins, raise them in the first resurrection, and give them eternal life (Mosiah 18:7-10; D&C 20:37).",0

Just as the body is laid to rest in the cold dark tomb, the waters of baptism envelope us as we enter in and then by the power of one holding authority we are raised from that same tomb. He who holds the authority of the Priesthood acts in behalf of the Savior and thus it should be interpreted to mean that as we fall into the grasp of spiritual death by our own doings, it is the Lord and only He who raises us up and lifts us from the depths of sin and sorrow. It is He who in reality takes us by the hand and lifts us to the heights of heaven that we may partake of His glory and redemption. It is likewise only through the Savior's infinite power that we are raised from death unto life that we may live eternally with the Father.

Baptism in and of itself is not enough to save one from spiritual darkness; baptism must be accompanied by true repentance and a desire to follow the Savior. Baptism only represents the change that we must go through in order to truly be born again. When we are baptized we symbolically reenact the process that we ourselves must go through to completely be born again. As mentioned before, to enter the water represents our own spiritual death, but it also represents the reliance we put upon a higher source to pull us from these depths. He who is officiating stands above the other and lowers them unto death and again unto life, just as we must allow Christ to lower the old man of sin unto death, so as to put an end to our old ways and habitats. We then must likewise allow the Savior to lift us from this death of the old man and allow Him to make of us a new person filled with His spirit, lifted up by His own hand.

Do you really baptize dead people?,0f19db52cb92867af019b4b1817a4320b2ae90eea8cd83be64ca28eecd5716b5,0.899564505,https://eom.byu.edu/index.php?title=First_Principles_of_the_Gospel#,First Principles of the Gospel,9,"Baptism, the third principle and first essential ordinance, is the fruit of repentance and is required of all who would be saved in the kingdom of God (John 3:3-5; cf. 2 Ne. 9:23). Baptism has several purposes. It is a symbolic washing and cleansing of sins and is prerequisite to membership in the Church. When followed by the reception of the Holy Ghost, it is the doorway to personal sanctification (Moro. 6:1-4). The prescribed method of baptism is by immersion in water by a priest in the Aaronic Priesthood or by one who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood. ""The symbolism of the rite is preserved in no other form"" (*AF*, p. 137).

Being ""born of the Spirit,"" or receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, entitles one to the continual help, guidance, and comfort of the Holy Ghost. ""The special office of the Holy Ghost is to enlighten and ennoble the mind, to purify and sanctify the soul, to incite to good works, and to reveal the things of God"" (*AF*, p. 167). When asked how the Church differed from the other religions of the day, Joseph Smith replied that ""we differed in mode of baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost&#133;[and] that all other considerations [of differences from other churches] were contained in the gift of the Holy Ghost"" (*HC* 4:42). The gift of the Holy Ghost is conferred by the laying-on of hands by a holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood.",0

That light came when other Christian churches taught that death irrevocably, eternally, determined the destiny of the soul. They taught the baptized were rewarded with endless joy while all others faced eternal torment without hope of redemption.

The Lord's revelation that through proper priesthood authority, baptism could be performed vicariously for the dead preserved the justice of His statement: ""Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.""1 Vicarious baptism can mercifully provide this essential ordinance for all worthy deceased who did not receive it in mortality.

This glorious doctrine is another witness of the all-encompassing nature of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. He made salvation available to every repentant soul. His Atonement conquered death, and He permits the worthy deceased to receive all ordinances of salvation vicariously.

In an epistle written over 150 years ago, Joseph Smith stated: ""The Saints have the privilege of being baptized for … their relatives who are dead … who have received the Gospel in the spirit, through … those who have been commissioned to preach to them.""2 Later he added, ""Those Saints who neglect it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at the peril of their own salvation.""3",3

Tonight I would like to speak about missionary service. I direct my comments to the vast army of young men who hold the Aaronic Priesthood who are gathered throughout the entire world and to their fathers, grandfathers, and priesthood leaders who watch over them.

Missionary work is a subject very close to my heart, as it is to every member of the eight Quorums of the Seventy, whom the Lord has appointed to go ""before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.""1 Missionary work is the lifeblood of the Church and the lifesaving blessing to all who accept its message.",1

Thirty-five years after I served my first mission, I received a letter from a family whom I had taught but did not baptize. The letter shared that their family of four little children whom I once knew now consisted of four temple marriages, three full-time missionaries, three bishops, a Relief Society president, and a dozen grandchildren maturing and developing in the gospel. You can well imagine the thrill and joy I received knowing that I had helped to find them and to teach them the gospel of Jesus Christ.

In conclusion, may I testify of the blessings of missionary service. Last year, my father passed away at age 88. As a young man, he was called on a mission during the Depression, when few were able to serve. It was hard and difficult. He always said that his decision to serve a mission was the best decision he ever made. When he died, he left 10 children, 9 living; 56 grandchildren; and 116 great-grandchildren. Of his posterity, 32 served full-time missions and 15 spouses who married into the family had served missions, resulting in 47 full-time missionaries or almost 100 years of full-time missionary work. All of this resulted, in part, because one man served a mission. I shall be forever grateful that my father served a mission and that I was motivated and taught to follow his example.

I bear witness of this great privilege we all have in the Church—to be missionaries. Inherent in our responsibility of holding the priesthood is to be a missionary. I pray that we will all fulfill that obligation we have to the Lord. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.",2

I was required to transfer them frequently because they could not take it. Finally, I asked one of my finest missionaries to become his companion, urging him to do all he could to help his fellow missionary love his work. As I approached a conference in the city where they were laboring, I feared he, like his predecessors, would ask for a transfer. To my surprise, when I asked how he was getting along with his companion, he responded: ""We are doing great! We discovered we had something in common. Neither of us has been to Africa!""

I promise you that you will make some of the most enduring friendships of your life. I look back on my own mission and the men I associated with there. They have had a powerful, positive effect on my life. They are among my closest friends.

We are missionaries every day in our families, in our schools, in our places of employment, and in our communities. Regardless of our age, experience, or station in life, we are all missionaries.

Proclaiming the gospel is not an activity in which we periodically and temporarily engage. And our labors as missionaries certainly are not confined to the short period of time devoted to full-time missionary service in our youth or in our mature years. Rather, the obligation to proclaim the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is inherent in the oath and covenant of the priesthood into which we enter. Missionary work essentially is a priesthood responsibility, and all of us who hold the priesthood are the Lord's authorized servants on the earth and are missionaries at all times and in all places—and we always will be. Our very identity as holders of the priesthood and the seed of Abraham is in large measure defined by the responsibility to proclaim the gospel.

My message tonight is applicable to all of us in our priesthood duty to proclaim the gospel.

Parents, families, friends, and donors to the General Missionary Fund may also assist. All missionaries, younger and older, serve with the sole hope of making life better for other people.

The decision to serve a mission will shape the spiritual destiny of the missionary, his or her spouse, and their posterity for generations to come. A desire to serve is a natural outcome of one's conversion, worthiness, and preparation.

In this great worldwide audience, many of you are not affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and know very little about us and our missionaries. You are here or tuned in because you want to know more about the Mormons and what our missionaries teach. As you learn more about us, you will find that we share many of the same values. We encourage you to keep all that is good and true and then see if we can add more. In this world filled with challenges, we do need help from time to time. Religion, eternal truth, and our missionaries are vital parts of that help.

Our young missionaries set aside their education, occupation, dating, and whatever else young adults would typically be doing at this stage of life. For 18 to 24 months they put it all on hold because of their deep desire to serve the Lord.2 And some of our missionaries serve in their more mature years of life. I know their families are blessed. In our own family, eight are currently serving as full-time missionaries—three daughters, their husbands, one granddaughter, and one grandson.",3

Eight men were called as General Authorities. Six women were called to the presidencies of the Relief Society and Young Women. Over two hundred men were called to serve as bishops, and over seventeen hundred men and women were called as full-time missionaries. In that same month, tens of thousands of others were called as officers and teachers and other workers in the many Church organizations throughout the world. Those called in April joined millions of others already serving in similar capacities in the restored Church.

As I contemplated my own calling and the callings of millions of others already in service, I was led to consider this question: Why do we serve?

Service is an imperative for those who worship Jesus Christ. To followers who were vying for prominent positions in his kingdom, the Savior taught, ""Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant."" (Matt. 20:27.) On a later occasion, he spoke of ministering to the needs of the hungry, the naked, the sick, and the imprisoned. He concluded that teaching with these words: ""Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."" (Matt. 25:40.)",1

Missionary work results in many rejections. It is easy to be discouraged. ""And ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect; for mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts.""6

Third, be obedient, faithful, and true. Missionaries serve in companionships for protection. A missionary best protects his companion when he is loyal to the Lord and helps his companion. By keeping the missionary rules, you gain the freedom of having the Spirit assist you.

Fourth, teach and testify. ""And ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two, in my name, lifting up your voices as with the sound of a trump, declaring my word like unto angels of God.""7",2

As the Apostle Paul said, we that are strong enough to bear the infirmities of the weak should not do so ""to please ourselves."" (Rom. 15:1.) Reasons aimed at earthly rewards are distinctly lesser in character and reward than the other reasons I will discuss.

Some may serve out of fear of punishment. The scriptures abound with descriptions of the miserable state of those who fail to follow the commandments of God. Thus, King Benjamin taught his people that the soul of the unrepentant transgressor would be filled with ""a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever."" (Mosiah 2:38.) Such descriptions surely offer sufficient incentive for keeping the commandment of service. But service out of fear of punishment is a lesser motive at best.",1

These are those I would call the good soldiers, who instinctively do what they are asked without question and sometimes without giving much thought to the reasons for their service. Such persons fill the ranks of voluntary organizations everywhere, and they do much good. We have all benefited by the good works of such persons. Those who serve out of a sense of duty or loyalty to various wholesome causes are the good and honorable men and women of the earth.

Service of the character I have just described is worthy of praise and will surely qualify for blessings, especially if it is done willingly and joyfully. As the Apostle Paul wrote in his second letter to the Corinthians:

""But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

""Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver."" (2 Cor. 9:6–7.)

People serve one another for different reasons, and some reasons are better than others. Perhaps none of us serves in every capacity all the time for only a single reason. Since we are imperfect beings, most of us probably serve for a combination of reasons, and the combinations may be different from time to time as we grow spiritually. But we should all strive to serve for the reasons that are highest and best.

What are some of the reasons for service? By way of illustration, and without pretending to be exhaustive, I will suggest six reasons. I will discuss these in ascending order from the lesser to the greater reasons for service.

Some may serve for hope of earthly reward. Such a man or woman might serve in Church positions or in private acts of mercy in an effort to achieve prominence or cultivate contacts that would increase income or aid in acquiring wealth. Others might serve in order to obtain worldly honors, prominence, or power.",1

They accept, indeed, a reiteration of it in modern times: ""Go ye into all the world, preach the gospel to every creature, acting in the authority which I have given you, baptizing in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost"" (D&C 68:8). Missionaries consider themselves emissaries of the Lord in proclaiming his message.

**WHO ARE CALLED.** In the first generation of the Church, married men frequently were called to be missionaries, and they left wives and families for an indeterminate length of time. In recent decades, the majority of missionaries have been young men and women who serve about two years.

Currently, the Church calls as missionaries, on a voluntary, temporary basis, single men from the ages of nineteen to twenty-six, single women twenty-one years and older, and older married couples with no dependent children. Missionary service is coordinated with military service as required.

Missionaries or their families generally cover the major costs of serving a mission. Missionaries called from developing nations may receive needed financial assistance from the general missionary fund of the Church. This assistance covers only basic living costs, as the Church has no paid ministry. No one is paid for missionary service.",3

He said, ""I don't want to go."" I asked, ""What has that got to do with it? We need you.""

President Kimball has said we don't have *half enough* missionaries. Can't you see that it doesn't matter whether you want to go or not? You're needed! Do you know what it means to be needed? The bonds of brotherhood are forged deep and strong in the mission field. You will develop a love for a companion with whom you kneel in daily prayer. You will learn to love the people where you serve, no matter what nationality or condition. And they will love you. They will love you because you brought them the gospel.

Converts always remember those who taught them. I've heard many converts speak almost reverently of ""our missionaries."" Imagine having people pray for you. Do you understand what that means? This will always be a purifying and refining influence in your life.

Many people out there are praying for the truth. You are the one who can bring it to them best. At present only 18,000 of you are serving. There are nearly 60,000, 19 through 25, who have not. We need more, many more. Missionary service is not preempted by any other thing. Marriage does not take precedence. Your work does not have priority. Your education is interrupted to fill this calling. College-related activities may be timed to satisfy both school and mission requirements. Some of you may be physically handicapped. There may yet be opportunity to serve in fitting ways locally.

Your moral worthiness is a prime consideration. We want no flabbiness of character when spiritual strength is required. Study! Get some colored pencils. Keep them with your Book of Mormon. Underline verses important to you. Another tool of missionary work is an additional language. Study one. We should ""become acquainted with … languages, tongues, and people."" (D&C 90:15.)",1

The Savior applied that principle in the Sermon on the Mount, in which he commanded us to love our enemies, bless them that curse us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them that despitefully use us and persecute us. (See Matt. 5:44.) He explained the purpose of that commandment as follows:

""For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?

""And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?"" (Matt. 5:46–47.)

This principle—that our service should be for the love of God and the love of fellowmen rather than for personal advantage or any other lesser motive—is admittedly a high standard. The Savior must have seen it so, since he joined his commandment for selfless and complete love directly with the ideal of perfection. The very next verse of the Sermon on the Mount contains this great commandment: ""Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."" (Matt. 5:48.)

This principle of service is reaffirmed in the fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants:

""Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day."" (D&C 4:2.)

We learn from this command that it is not enough to serve God with all of our *might and strength.* He who looks into our hearts and knows our minds demands more than this. In order to stand blameless before God at the last day, we must also serve him with all our *heart and mind.*

Service with all of our heart and mind is a high challenge for all of us. Such service must be free of selfish ambition. It must be motivated only by the pure love of Christ.",2

Most of our missionaries are young men and women who serve for one and a half to two years, and do so without financial remuneration, supporting their service from personal savings and contributions from family members and loved ones.

Our missionaries are now teaching the gospel throughout the world in sixty-nine languages. When released, they return home to resume their education and the normal pursuits of life. But they also continue as advocates of the people whose culture, language, and ways they have come to love. They serve because the Lord issued a commandment: ""Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost"" (Matt. 28:19; see also Mark 16:15). On another occasion, the Master stated: ""Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God"" John 3:5).

In response to a call, they have left behind home, family, friends, and school and have gone forward to serve. Those who don't understand ask the question, ""Why do they respond so readily and willingly give so much?""

Our missionaries could well answer in the words of Paul, that peerless missionary of an earlier day: ""For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!""5

The holy scriptures contain no proclamation more relevant, no responsibility more binding, no instruction more direct than the injunction given by the resurrected Lord as He appeared in Galilee to the eleven disciples. Said He:

""All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

""Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

""Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.""6

This divine command, coupled with its glorious promise, is our watchword today, as it was in the meridian of time. Missionary work is an identifying feature of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Always has it been; ever shall it be. As the Prophet Joseph Smith declared, ""After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel.""7

Within two short years, all of the full-time missionaries currently serving in this royal army of God will have concluded their full-time labors and will have returned to their homes and loved ones.

If the blessings for missionary couples and their families are so plentiful, why are only a few thousand serving instead of the tens of thousands that are so desperately needed? I believe the four F's often stand in their way: *Fear, Family concerns, Finances,* and *Finding the right mission opportunity.*

*First, fear.* Fear of the unknown or fear that we don't have the scriptural skills or language required can cause reluctance to serve. But the Lord has said, ""If ye are prepared ye shall not fear"" (D&C 38:30). Your life is your preparation. You have valuable experience. You have raised a family and served in the Church. Just go and be yourselves. The Lord has promised that angels will go before you (see D&C 103:19–20). You will be told by the Spirit what to say and when to say it in a very natural process as you strengthen young missionaries, testify to investigators and new members, teach leadership skills, and friendship and fellowship less-active members, helping them return to full activity. *You* are the testimony, and you will touch the lives of those with whom you come in contact.

I have been on four missions, and presided over two, and I have toured many missions, and love to hear those young men bear their testimonies. For instance, another young man in Oregon in our testimony meeting said that there wasn't a company in this world that could pay him a large enough salary to get him to leave his missionary work. And he had been in the armed forces and away from home for several years and then out into the mission field. I had a letter here just last week from a missionary from up in Idaho, and I copied a little paragraph from it. I'd like to read it to you. He said this:

""There is no greater work than that of missionary work. My mission has been the most rewarding undertaking in my entire twenty-seven years of life. My life is dedicated to serving the Lord. My heart is overflowing as are the tears of joy that are now coming from my eyes. There is nothing so wonderful—nothing—as tasting the joy and success of missionary labors.""

I had a young missionary come in to visit with me as he returned from the Argentine. I knew his people back in Washington, and he had been kept over to help train some of the other missionaries, until he had been away from home for three years. And I said, ""Craig, do you feel like it was a waste of time to be in the mission field, that you ought to have been home getting your education and getting ready to settle down?"" He said, ""Now listen, bishop, if the Brethren want to make me happy, just let them load me on the plane in the morning and let them send me back to the Argentine."" You can't put that kind of feeling in the hearts of young people with money. The Lord who creates the feelings of the human breast is the only one who can put that kind of faith into the hearts of his people.",1

We're all faced with different obstacles that sometimes make serving missions seem difficult. In my dad's case, his father was ill. Jose Manuel's family didn't want him to go. I wondered about my basketball future. Many of the obstacles we face are those within our own minds. For just a minute I want to talk directly to you—just you. You who might say, ""I have this girlfriend""; or, ""I've got a good job and a car""; or, ""I've never been good at schoolwork, and I know I could never memorize scriptures and all those discussions""; or, ""I can't talk to people who I don't even know""; or, ""I couldn't be obedient to all the rules missionaries follow""; or, ""I don't really know the Church is true, so how could I tell others about it?""

To those who have such thought and feelings: if you don't now have a testimony, you can gain one on a mission. Your girlfriend will be all right. You can learn the scriptures and discussions well enough to be effective. You'll have the courage you need to talk to strangers. You can be obedient. You can do it.

Some of you may be fearful about your ability because to this point in your life you have struggled. Perhaps you've not been academically gifted or socially prominent.

He ate with them. He walked with them. Before His final Ascension, He commissioned them to ""go … and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.""5 The Apostles heeded that instruction. They also called upon others to help them fulfill the Lord's command.

Today, under the direction of modern apostles and prophets, that same charge has been extended to missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. These missionaries serve in more than 150 nations. As representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ, they strive to fulfill that divine command—renewed in our day by the Lord Himself—to take the fulness of the gospel abroad and bless the lives of people everywhere.6

Missionaries in their late teens or early 20s are young in ways of the world. But they are blessed with gifts—such as the power of the Holy Spirit, the love of God, and testimonies of the truth—that make them powerful ambassadors of the Lord. They share the good news of the gospel that will bring true joy and everlasting happiness to all who heed their message. And in many instances they do so in a country and a language foreign to them.

Missionaries strive to follow Jesus Christ in both word and deed. They preach of Jesus Christ and of His Atonement.7 They teach of the literal Restoration of Christ's ancient Church through the Lord's first latter-day prophet, Joseph Smith.

Members of the early Church, from the newest to the most seasoned, took part in the Savior's great commission, sharing the good news of the gospel with those they met and knew. The determination to share their testimony of Jesus Christ helped His newly established Church grow expansively.2

We too, as Christ's disciples, are invited to heed His commission today, as if we were there on that mountain in Galilee when He first proclaimed it. This commission began again in 1830, when Joseph Smith set apart his brother Samuel as an early missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ.3 Since that time, more than 1.5 million missionaries have traveled throughout the world teaching all nations and baptizing those who embrace the glad tidings of the restored gospel.

This is our doctrine. Our fond desire.

From our young children to the eldest among us, we yearn for the time when we can heed the Savior's call and share the gospel with the nations of the world. I am sure you young men and young women felt a similar empowering challenge from our prophet yesterday as he invited you to prepare for full-time missionary service just as the Savior did with His Apostles.

Like sprinters at the starting blocks, we wait with anticipation for the official invitation, complete with the prophet's signature, signaling the start of the race! This desire is noble and inspirational; however, let's consider this question: why don't we *all* begin now?

You might ask, ""How can I be a missionary without a name badge?"" Or we tell ourselves, ""The full-time missionaries are set apart to do this work. I would like to help but perhaps later when life has calmed down a bit.""

Brothers and sisters, it is much simpler than that! Gratefully, the Savior's great commission can be accomplished through simple, easily understandable principles taught to each of us from childhood: love, share, and invite.",3

Modern prophets have taught that every young man who is physically and mentally able should prepare himself to serve an honorable mission. The Lord did not say, ""Go on a mission if it fits your schedule, or if you happen to feel like it, or if it doesn't interfere with your scholarship, your romance, or your educational plans."" Preaching the gospel is a commandment and not merely a suggestion. It is a blessing and a privilege and not a sacrifice. Remember, even though for some of you there may be very tempting reasons for you not to serve a full-time mission, the Lord and his prophets are counting on you.

More than ever before in my life, I know that Jesus is the Christ. This is his Church and it is led by living prophets. The Lord and his prophets are counting on you to:

1. Be a champion of those who need you.
2. Avoid the trash that surrounds you in the media.
3. Be worthy to enter the temple and fill an honorable mission.

That one moment in time changed everything forever. The Savior broke down every barrier that stood in the way of our return to a loving Heavenly Father. In return He asks that we ""go … and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

""Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world"" (Matt. 28:19–20).

A more intimate version of the same message is recorded in the Gospel of John. On the shore of the Sea of Galilee, Jesus asked Peter three times, ""Lovest thou me?"" Each time Peter's reply was the same: ""Thou knowest that I love thee."" And each time the Savior instructed Peter: ""Feed my lambs. … Feed my sheep. … Feed my sheep"" (John 21:15–17).

The Savior's impassioned charge to ""feed [His] sheep"" continues in force today. Like Peter and his brethren of old, the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ today have the charge to take the gospel to all the world. This charge is seldom far from our minds. Every General Authority has the responsibility to be a missionary.

But the Savior was not just talking to the Apostles. He was also talking to every person who has been blessed to hear the gospel and is a member of His Church. In revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord puts it in very simple terms: ""It becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor"" (D&C 88:81).",2

I grew up in a home with very good parents, but my father was not a member and my mother was less active. After my mission that changed. They became strong members and served devotedly in the temple—he a sealer, she an ordinance worker. But as a young man, like many of you today, I had no way to judge personally the importance of a mission. I fell in love with an exceptional young woman. At a critical point in our courtship, she made it very clear that she would only be married in the temple to a returned missionary. Duly motivated, I served a mission in Uruguay.

It was not easy. The Lord gave me many challenges that became stepping-stones to personal growth. There I gained my testimony that God the Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, did in fact visit Joseph Smith to begin a restoration of truth, priesthood authority, and the true Church on earth. I gained a witness that Joseph Smith is a singular prophet. I learned essential doctrines. I discovered what it meant to be led by the Spirit. Many a night I got up as my companion slept to pour my heart out to the Lord for guidance and direction. I pled for the ability to express effectively in Spanish my testimony and the truth I was learning to a people I had come to love. Those prayers were abundantly answered. At the same time, my future eternal companion, Jeanene, was being molded to become an exceptional wife and mother by her own mission.",2

You can help the full-time and stake missionaries bring new investigators to church and make them feel comfortable. Let them know that they have a new friend. Strengthen that friendship by inviting them to your home or to Church activities with you. You can support them in obeying the commandments. Such valuable missionary service is not difficult because it can be carried out in the normal routine of your daily life.

There are other ways you may not think of as missionary service. For example, a young mother can teach each growing son to prepare to be a missionary to preach the gospel and to share his testimony of truth. As mother and father cultivate that thought throughout his growing years, he will be a missionary. That is excellent missionary service.",0

How blessed we would be if we could pattern our conduct after the Nephites described by Alma:

""And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church.""

Our missionaries could well answer in the words of Paul, that peerless missionary of an earlier day: ""For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!""5

The holy scriptures contain no proclamation more relevant, no responsibility more binding, no instruction more direct than the injunction given by the resurrected Lord as He appeared in Galilee to the eleven disciples. Said He:

""All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

They also called upon others to help them fulfill the Lord's command.

Today, under the direction of modern apostles and prophets, that same charge has been extended to missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. These missionaries serve in more than 150 nations. As representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ, they strive to fulfill that divine command—renewed in our day by the Lord Himself—to take the fulness of the gospel abroad and bless the lives of people everywhere.6

Missionaries in their late teens or early 20s are young in ways of the world. But they are blessed with gifts—such as the power of the Holy Spirit, the love of God, and testimonies of the truth—that make them powerful ambassadors of the Lord. They share the good news of the gospel that will bring true joy and everlasting happiness to all who heed their message. And in many instances they do so in a country and a language foreign to them.

Missionaries strive to follow Jesus Christ in both word and deed. They preach of Jesus Christ and of His Atonement.7 They teach of the literal Restoration of Christ's ancient Church through the Lord's first latter-day prophet, Joseph Smith.

Jehovah gave him a vision of his immediate goal, which was to ""deliver my people from bondage."" (Moses 1:26.) The Lord then explained his long-term goal: ""This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."" (Moses 1:39.)

From the Book of Mormon we read of the young prophet Nephi who also beheld a vision on a mountain. (See 1 Ne. 11:1.) Once he had envisioned the promised land, he could not be dissuaded from building a ship that would take him there. (See 1 Ne. 17–18.) Once parents have a vision of a son dressed in a missionary suit or of a daughter in the temple dressed in white, then family home evening, family prayer, and scripture study assume their proper place in every home. From Moses and Nephi we learn that *a leader must have a vision of the work which lies ahead.*",0

Some years ago I was traveling in the Rosario Argentina Mission up in the northern part of Argentina. As we were traveling along the road, we passed a large herd of cattle being moved. The herd was moving peaceably and without difficulty. The herd was quiet. There were no dogs. Out in front leading the herd were three gauchos on horseback, each about fifteen or twenty yards apart. These three horsemen were slumped forward in their saddles, completely relaxed, confident that the herd would follow them. At the rear of the herd was a single rider bringing up the rear. He, too, was slumped forward in his saddle as if he were sleeping. The whole herd moved peacefully, quietly, and was subdued. From that experience it seemed obvious to me that leadership is about three-fourths show-the-way and about one-fourth follow-up.",0

While the role of administrator is a necessary one, it is not the most vital aspect of leadership, which is to minister. Christ's admonition ""Feed my sheep"" (John 21:15-17) applies to latter-day discipleship. The characteristics of effective spiritual leadership are those that enable individuals to minister to their brothers and sisters in the gospel, including a willingness to seek and follow the counsel of the Lord as manifested through the Holy Ghost, on one's own behalf and on behalf of those in need of direction. In addition, leaders are to understand the nature of their stewardships and seek to fulfill their responsibilities in meekness and humility. Good leaders understand their roles as servants to others (Matt. 20:27). Thus, doubly benefited, persons gain from leadership experiences through unselfishly serving in a Christlike way and, through such service, come to know the Lord (Mosiah 5:13).",0

First, and very important, members are given early and repeated opportunities to serve, thereby learning from experience. Beginning at age twelve, young men and women can serve as teachers for children or as members of class presidencies or of youth activities committees. In addition, teacher development courses and in-service lessons assist teachers, and leadership training meetings instruct leaders of various organizations. Manuals and handbooks outline the responsibilities of individuals serving in different organizations at both ward and stake levels.

Lay participation and leadership have several implications for the Church and its members. Part of the mission of the Church is to perfect the Saints (Eph. 4:12), to sponsor growth in individual members. Utilizing volunteer members at all levels of the organization may not ensure peak efficiency, but it does provide the experiences and interactions that will help members progress. Volunteer staffing also means that in most of the callings members work part-time and that this service is in addition to regular employment and other responsibilities. This provides the opportunity for learning to sacrifice and to balance commitments. In general, members who serve maintain a high level of commitment to the Church, in part because of their awareness that they are responsible for making a contribution and because they take satisfaction from doing so. Because professional training is not required, lay leadership lessens the sense of hierarchy and increases feelings of unity. The children's music leader may have more formal education than the bishop. After being released in a few years, that bishop may serve as children's music leader. Opportunities to serve in a variety of callings and to be served by people in different capacities can increase the sense of brotherhood and sisterhood shared by Church members.",0

Nevertheless, we also have communication and transportation resources undreamed of in earlier times. Whatever the physical changes over time, the nature of our local leaders' callings has not changed, nor has their compensation. They are totally uncompensated by the coin of mortality. For the reward of their labors, all rely on the Lord's deferred compensation plan.

Unchanged also is the fact that as they struggle with the heavy duties of their callings, bishops and their counselors must also earn a living and fulfill other family responsibilities.

While Bishop Partridge and his counselors were to be supported through consecration, today most Church officers receive paid compensation for their labor. While there have been differences in the way the Church has been administered over time, throughout most of its history the Church has not had a professional ministry. These verses do open the door for a small number of employees to receive payment from the Church, but these employees hold no ecclesiastical position based on their employment.

It is true that those called to full-time service in the Church, such as the general officers, receive a stipend for support. However, this stipend comes from the private investments of the Church, and not from the offerings of members. President Gordon B.

Likewise, the *Encyclopedia of Mormonism,* published in cooperation with the Church, clarifies that ""unlike local leaders, who maintain their normal vocations while serving in Church assignments, General Authorities set aside their careers to devote their full time to the ministry of their office.

Some members say, ""I'm afraid to share the gospel because I might offend someone."" Experience has shown that people are not offended when the sharing is motivated by the spirit of love and concern. How could anyone be offended when we say something like this: ""I love the way my church helps me"" and then add whatever the Spirit directs. It's when we appear only to be fulfilling an assignment and we fail to express real interest and love that we offend others. Don't ever forget, brothers and sisters, that you and I have in our possession the very points of doctrine that will bring people to the Lord. The restored gospel of Jesus Christ has within it the power to bring deep and abiding happiness to the human soul—something that will be valued and cherished for the rest of time and for all eternity. We are not just trying to get people to join our Church; we are sharing with them the fulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. But as powerful as our message is, it cannot be imposed or forced upon people. It can only be shared—heart to heart, soul to soul, spirit to spirit—by being good neighbors and by caring and showing love. We need to be watchful for one another and reach out to one another.

Thus, in the sacrament prayers inaugurated by Jesus himself and preserved by the Book of Mormon, we renew our baptismal covenants and witness anew our willingness to keep the commandments that have been given to us (3 Nephi 18:7, 10; Moroni 4-5). The remission of sins comes not simply by being washed in water but by reception of the gift and power of the Holy Ghost, as recognition by God of our repentance and willingness to enter a covenant relationship with him. Because the covenant we make at baptism is essential to our salvation, the clarity that the Book of Mormon brings to the subject is both urgent for all people to understand and also as a display of God's mercy and generosity toward all who have faith, repentance, and humble themselves before Jesus, their Lord.",3

The Book of Mormon provides adequate instructions for baptism and proper words for the baptismal prayer (3 Ne. 11:23-28; Moro. 6:1-4; cf. D&C 20:73).

In addition to relying on information in the Book of Mormon, Latter-day Saints follow the New Testament teachings on baptism. Jesus taught that baptism is necessary for salvation. He told Nicodemus, ""Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God"" (John 3:1-5). He required baptism of those who professed to become his disciples (John 4:1-2). His farewell commission to his apostles was that they should go to all nations, teaching and baptizing (Matt. 28:19), and he declared, ""He that believeth *and is baptized* shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned"" (Mark 16:16; emphasis added). Paul, after his miraculous vision on the road to Damascus, was taught the gospel by Ananias who told him to ""arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins"" (Acts 22:16). To the penitent multitude on the day of Pentecost, Peter proclaimed, ""Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins"" (Acts 2:38).

Latter-day Saints do not accept baptismal practices and teachings that arose among some Christian groups in the centuries after the death of the apostles, including infant baptism, baptism by means other than immersion, and the idea that baptism is not necessary for salvation. The Nephite prophet Mormon denounced the practice of infant baptism, which had apparently crept in among his people, and declared that anyone who supposed that little children need baptism would deny the mercies of Christ, setting at naught the value of his Atonement and the power of his redemption (Moro. 8:4-20).",2

Reynolds, an emeritus professor of Political Science at BYU and former director of the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), highlighted the fact that the New Testament uses two different metaphors for what the act of baptism represents. The first is the idea of purification, or the washing away of sins, as can be seen in Acts 22:15–16. The second is the idea that it is a representation of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, as introduced by Paul (Romans 6:4).1: 5. "")

The Book of Mormon has a third, and very important, metaphor of the main purpose of baptism. Reynolds demonstrates that for Nephi and subsequent Book of Mormon figures, baptism principally serves as an outward sign or open witness of one's repentance and commitment to follow Jesus Christ.2 Instead of cleansing from sin, Reynolds notes, ""the Book of Mormon consistently points to a different symbolism: the making of a covenant.""3 The cleansing then comes by the purifying fire of the Holy Ghost (3 Nephi 12:2).

This distinction is of great importance and clarifies a doctrine that Christ, in the New Testament, declared to be essential for entrance into the kingdom of God (John 3:5; 1 Peter 3:21). As LDS scholar Craig Ostler has also argued, although the baptism of Jesus is the ""first common topic"" in the four Gospels, ""the importance of baptism as an ordinance of the gospel of Jesus Christ and an understanding of why baptism is given such a place of importance are not generally as familiar."" He also rightly notes that ""the Book of Mormon clarifies the covenant nature of baptism.""4, 144."")",0

(1 Nephi 13:26),"" KnoWhy 15 (January 20, 2016)."") The teachings contained in the Book of Mormon regarding the purpose of baptism are unique and exceptional in all of ancient scripture for their clarity, specificity and consistency. In contrast to biblical descriptions of baptism, the Book of Mormon provides profound insight into the covenantal nature of this ordinance, what the individual is signaling to God when he or she chooses to be baptized, and the way in which God responds to the believer's commitment.

Furthermore, the Book of Mormon demonstrates how the act of baptism fits into the larger picture of the ""doctrine"" and ""gospel"" of Christ. One may be led to assume, without the teachings contained in the Book of Mormon, that the act of baptism, on its own, can provide the believer with a remission of sins. However, the teachings of the Book of Mormon indicate that baptism is one part of an organic whole that includes faith, repentance, baptism, the reception of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. The text makes clear that baptism without repentance or the purifying effect of the Holy Ghost is not enough to wash away sins. As Noel Reynolds noted:

> A surprising implication of this Book of Mormon language is that the covenant the convert signals at baptism is actually made before baptism and is the central element of repentance. Genuine repentance always includes a deliberate commitment by the penitent person to turn to Christ and walk in his path—taking his name upon oneself and keeping his commandments. Baptism and repentance are thus linked together: baptism completes repentance.

As 2 Nephi 31:7 states, ""But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments."" In fact, in the ancient world, the swearing of an oath, the bearing of a testimony in court, or the making of a contract or covenant was often accompanied by outward gestures, submission to an ordeal, and the invocation of the name of the god who would attest to its enforcement.

Subsequent narratives regarding the ordinance of baptism in the Book of Mormon decisively follow this precedent. When Alma baptizes his followers at the waters of Mormon, he emphasizes the fact that their baptism serves ""as a witness before [God] that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you"" (Mosiah 18:10). The first baptism he performs, for the man Helam, includes the words: ""I baptize thee … as a testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until you are dead"" (Mosaiah 18:13).",3

Whitney taught: ""Baptism is twofold, and has a double mission to perform. It not only cleanses—it [illuminates] the soul, making manifest the things of God, past, present, future, and imparting a sure testimony of the Truth. The soul, cleansed of sin, is in a condition to enjoy the abiding influence of the Holy Ghost, which 'dwelleth not in unclean tabernacles.' Water baptism begins the work of purification and enlightenment. Spirit baptism completes it"" (*Baptism—The Birth of Water and of Spirit* [n.d.], 10).

The ordinance of baptism by water and fire is described as a gate by Nephi (see 2 Nephi 31:17). Why is baptism a gate? Because it is an ordinance denoting entry into a sacred and binding covenant between God and man. Men promise to forsake the world, love and serve their fellowmen, visit the fatherless and the widows in their afflictions, proclaim peace, preach the gospel, serve the Lord, and keep His commandments. The Lord promises to ""pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon [us]"" (Mosiah 18:10), redeem His Saints both temporally and spiritually, number them with those of the First Resurrection, and offer life eternal. Baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost are the prescribed ways to enter the strait and narrow path to eternal life.

According to the Apostle Paul, baptism also denotes our descent into a watery grave from which we are raised with ""newness of life"" (Romans 6:4) in Christ.

Repentance. The centrality of faith is emphasized by the way the gospel is presented in the Book of Mormon, with faith usually mentioned in the center and the call to repentance at the first. Individuals must forsake their sins and offer up ""a sacrifice&#133;[of] a broken heart and a contrite spirit."" This requires that the sinner come down into the depths of humility and become ""as a little child"" (3 Ne. 9:20-22).

3. Baptism. The gospel emphasizes the absolute need for baptism for those accountable and capable of sin. Like repentance, baptism is also a commandment, and candidates for salvation must be baptized in order to obey the commandment (see 2 Ne. 31:6-7).

This essential ordinance is a witness to the Father that the repentant individual has covenanted with God to keep his commandments and has taken upon himself or herself the name of Christ. Faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and baptism are the gate by which one enters into the way that leads to eternal life (2 Ne. 31:13-15). Because infants are incapable of sin or of making such covenants, parents are instructed to prepare them for baptism by the time they reach eight years of age, the age of accountability established in revelation (D&C 68:25-28; see Infant Baptism).

4. The Holy Ghost. While water baptism symbolizes purification and rising from death to life, the actual cleansing or remission of sins comes by obedience, and as a gift from God ""by fire and by the Holy Ghost"" (2 Ne. 31:17; Matt. 3:11), by which the individual is born of God, having become a ""new creature"" (Mosiah 27:24-26; 1 Pet. 1:23). This spiritual experience is a witness from the Father and the Son that the sacrifice of the penitent has been accepted. After Jesus had taught the Nephites and they were baptized, ""the Holy Ghost did fall upon them, and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and with fire"" (3 Ne. 19:13; cf. Acts 2:4).",3

For members of the Church, the covenants made at baptism and other occasions are renewed as we partake of the sacrament.35

In the ordinances of baptism and the sacrament, we covenant to keep the commandments of the Father and the Son, always remember Christ, and be willing to take Christ's name (or His work and attributes36) upon us.37 The Savior, in return, covenants to forgive, or remit, our sins38 and ""pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon [us].""39 Christ also promises to prepare us for eternal life by helping us become like Him.40

Douglas D. Holmes, First Counselor in the Young Men General Presidency, has written: ""The ordinances of baptism and the sacrament symbolize both the end result and process of being born again. In baptism, we bury the old man of flesh and come forth to a newness of life.41 In the sacrament, we learn that this change is a step-by-step process, [where] little by little, week by week, we are transformed as we repent, covenant, and through increased endowments of the Spirit [become like the Savior].""42",1

The accounts of baptisms performed shortly before Jesus' ministry among the Nephites confirm that this reason for baptism—""as a witness and a testimony before God""—was perpetuated until the time of Christ (3 Nephi 7:25). One of the most important of Christ's actions during his visit to the Nephites was the establishment of the ordinance of the Sacrament. Jesus' own teachings regarding the purpose of the Sacrament (3 Nephi 18:7, 10–11) as well as the words of the sacramental prayers (as recorded in Moroni 4–5), according to Reynolds, ""precisely recapitulate the converts' witnessing to the Father, renewing their prior witness of the covenant they had made to take upon themselves the name of Christ, to keep his commandments, and to remember him always.""",2

No other book of ancient scripture makes this point as clearly.

Alma and his people, wherever they were, made finding sources of ""pure water"" a priority (Mosiah 23:4). This suggests that Alma and his people recognized how important baptism and spiritual purity would be in building up the Church of Christ in their new land.

What may not be immediately clear to readers is that Alma's description of the baptismal covenant is tied into the atonement of Jesus Christ—in that he asked recent converts to imitate Christ's perfect love—charity. Such ""love"" is reflected in the Egyptian meaning of *Mormon*, and is also at the heart of what it means to be a Latter-day Saint—or ""Mormon,"" as some might say. Alma asks his followers to, like Christ, love one another by suffering vicariously the pains of others and having compassion on those who are in need of help and comfort. This is what the Savior does for us, and what we commit to do for others.5, 362."")

Likewise, excommunicants undergo baptism again once they have qualified for readmission into the Church.

The form of the ordinance is prescribed in latter-day revelation, which makes clear that the baptism must be performed by a person who has priesthood authority and that it requires completely immersing the penitent candidate below the water and then bringing the person out of the water (3 Ne. 11:25-26; D&C 20:72-74). Baptism is followed by the laying-on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.

Contemporary Church practice provides for the candidate to be interviewed and approved by an authorized priesthood official (usually the bishop or other officer presiding over the congregation or a mission official), who determines whether the applicant meets the qualifying conditions of repentance, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and an understanding of and willingness to obey the laws and ordinances of the gospel. It is also necessary that an official record of each baptism be kept by the Church.

Baptism may be performed in the font provided in many meetinghouses or in any body of water that is suitable for the sacred occasion and deep enough for complete immersion. The candidate and the person performing the ordinance will be dressed in plain and modest white clothing. The ceremony is unpretentious, typically attended by the candidate's family, close friends, and interested members of the congregation. A speaker or two may offer a few words of instruction and joyous welcome to the candidate.

The earlier practice of rebaptism to manifest repentance and recommitment, or for a restoration of health in time of sickness, is no longer practiced in the Church.",1

In the Book of Mormon, Nephi, the son of Lehi clarifies what it meant for Jesus to ""fulfill all righteousness."" Nephi explained that even though Jesus was perfect, by being baptized He ""showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments."" (2 Nephi 31:7).

Jesus did not need a remission of his sins because he was without sin, but by being baptized, he showed his humility, and willingly made a sacred covenant to do the will of His Father. In this way, He showed us what our Heavenly Father wants all of us to do.

In addition to teaching us why Jesus needed to be baptized, The Book of Mormon also plainly and distinctively teaches that baptism is a sacred witness and covenant that we make with God, that we are willing to trust in our Savior, and keep his commandments. Being submerged symbolizes the burial of our old selves. Coming up out of the water represents our being raised up into a new stage of life as we promise to follow our Savior.

Baptism puts believers on the covenant path and is an outward sign of our commitment to Heavenly Father. This unique doctrine is taught many times throughout the Book of Mormon. For example, Alma taught at the Waters of Mormon that baptism serves ""as a witness before [God] that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments"" (Mosiah 18:10). Nephi, son of Nephi, also confirmed that baptism acts ""as a witness and a testimony before God"" (3 Nephi 7:25). Because of the covenantal nature of baptism, the Book of Mormon also strongly states that little children are not to be baptized.",3

I was eight years of age. My parents taught me and my brothers the significance of this great ordinance. My mother told me that after my baptism I would be held accountable for the things I did that were not right. I remember the day of my baptism very vividly. I was baptized in the baptismal font in the Tabernacle on Temple Square. Those who were being baptized put on white coveralls and one by one were gently taken down the steps into the water. One of the children baptized that day was not totally immersed, and so the ordinance was repeated. This was necessary because, as the scriptures indicate, ""baptism symbolizes death, burial, and resurrection, and can only be done by immersion.""1 It also follows the pattern set by the Savior, who was baptized in the river Jordan, where there was much water. As Matthew records, ""And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water.""2

Even though I was only eight years of age, the words of the baptismal prayer penetrated deeply into my soul. After repeating my name, Brother Irvin G. Derrick, who baptized me, said, ""Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.""3",0

In the Book of Mormon, the one baptized makes a solemn commitment to follow Christ and thereafter keep His commandments, just as the early Christian converts to whom Peter wrote had promised to do.

Previous to baptism, converts in the Book of Mormon were questioned about their desires and willingness to serve God before making that commitment. And after being baptized and receiving a remission of their sins, those baptized were expected to continue to witness before God and the people that they were truly repentant and that they sought to pattern their lives after the Savior. Both the Bible and the Book of Mormon teach the same Gospel including the importance of the baptismal covenant. This scriptural consistency with the Bible reflects Mormon's stated purposed for the Book of Mormon: it was ""written for the intent that ye may believe that [the Bible]; and if ye believe that ye will believe this [the Book of Mormon] also"" (Mormon 7:9).",3

Mosiah 18:1 says that Alma first ""repented of his sins and iniquities,"" and then ""began to teach the words of Abinadi."" Those who believed his teachings went to a place called ""Mormon,""1, as was his father (Mormon 1:5)."") where there was ""a fountain of pure water"" (vv. 4–5).

In the ancient world, baptism and other rituals for cleansing were required to be done with ""pure water"" (see Hebrews 10:22; cf. Ezekiel 36:25), which is likely why Mosiah 18:5 specifies this aspect of the waters of Mormon. When Alma and his people fled from King Noah into another land, they chose their new home based on the fact that it was also ""a land of pure water"" (Mosiah 23:4).

When Alma began to baptize people, he declared that their baptism would be ""a witness before [the Lord] that ye have entered into a covenant with him"" (Mosiah 18:10,13). Later on, when the righteous people of King Limhi wanted to be baptized, they understood that baptism was meant to be ""a witness and a testimony that they were willing to serve God with all their hearts"" (Mosiah 21:35; cf. 3 Nephi 7:25).",2

The divine fiat has been to call all men to repent and be baptized. Baptism is a companion to repentance. It is a principle and an ordinance of the gospel, and when complied with, it is the power of entering into the kingdom of God on earth. Jesus complied with this ordinance to fulfill all righteousness. The prophet Nephi said:

""And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!"" (2 Ne. 31:5.)

The efficacy of the ordinance of baptism is unquestionable as it cleanses the reborn person.

Baptism prepares the individual to receive the rebirth of the spirit, the laying on of hands, for the gift of the Holy Ghost. Joseph Fielding Smith brings to mind these words from the Prophet Joseph Smith:

""*There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost.* Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would have left him. Until he obeyed these ordinances and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands, according to the order of God, he could not have healed the sick or commanded an evil spirit to come out of a man, and it obey him. …"" President Smith says further: ""It mattereth not whether we live long or short on the earth after we come to a knowledge of these principles and obey them unto the end.""

Latter-day Saints believe, as do many Christians, that baptism is an essential initiatory ordinance for all persons who are joining the Church, as it admits them to Christ's church on earth (John 3:3-5; D&C 20:37, 68-74). It is a primary step in the process, which includes faith, repentance, baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end, whereby members may receive remission of their sins and gain access to the Celestial Kingdom and eternal life (e.g., Mark 16:15-16; 2 Ne. 31:13-21; D&C 22:1-4;84:64, 74; *MD*, pp. 69-72).

Latter-day Saint baptisms are performed for converts who have been properly instructed, and are at least eight years of age (the age of accountability). Baptism must be performed by one who has proper priesthood authority. The major features of the ordinance include the raising of the right hand, the reciting of the prescribed baptismal prayer by the one performing the baptism, and the complete immersion of the candidate (3 Ne. 11:23-26; D&C 20:71-74;68:27). Baptism symbolizes the covenant by which people promise to come into the fold of God, to take upon themselves the name of Christ, to stand as a witness for God, to keep his commandments, and to bear one another's burdens, manifesting a determination to serve him to the end, and to prepare to receive the spirit of Christ for the remission of sins. The Lord, as his part of the covenant, is to pour out his spirit upon them, redeem them from their sins, raise them in the first resurrection, and give them eternal life (Mosiah 18:7-10; D&C 20:37).",3

Christ said to Nicodemus, ""Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

""Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?

""Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."" (John 3:3–5.)

Christ had already confirmed the fullness and exactness of this law in his own compliance thereto, as recorded in Matthew: ""Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.

""But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?

""And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him."" (Matt. 3:13–15.)

Baptism, then, is for *all* mankind, even Christ, the very Son of God, who was perfect and without sin. Then it is all the more necessary for all of *us.*

If required for all mankind, then would a just God condemn for all eternity those who came to the earth at such time when, and such places where, such opportunities were not available—hence, impossible for them to comply with the law?

Then if God is just, and we know he is, he must provide a way whereby all mankind may receive his ordinances, and they must be so performed as shall be accepted by him.",3

I hope what I say will help you to face the special challenges you will be required to meet in your maturing years.

Recently I met a young man who was receiving the missionary discussions. He had read the Book of Mormon and felt he had received answers to his prayers. He was now faced with the decision of whether or not to be baptized.

This was a rather remarkable young man. He had experienced some severe tests in his life, and he had demonstrated great courage and resourcefulness. The prospect of becoming a member of the Church, however, gave him a different kind of challenge.

As we talked about this newest and most important decision with which he was faced, he asked, ""Why are so many people critical of Mormons?"" He then described some of the things he had experienced at the hands of friends, family, and fellow employees for having associated with the missionaries. ""I'm not sure I can live with that kind of feeling against me if I join the Church,"" he said. ""Why can't I believe what your church teaches, but just go on being a good Christian without becoming a Mormon?""

It isn't difficult for us to know what the consequences will be for this young man if he chooses not to be baptized because of the fear of incurring ill feelings from family and friends. He is, of course, perfectly free to make this choice, but he is *not* free to determine the consequences of that decision.",0

But it's not like there's like it has been twenty years and you go through all these hoops before you ever get to hold onto the rod. It's like immediately you can get on the path, and the path itself has a series of sequences of rituals and events that brings you closer to God. But I see what you're talking about here. There's no reason to put obstacles in people's path when they're willing to demonstrate that they want to follow Jesus.
What a powerful – powerful manifestation of God's mercy, that he allows us to be baptized. Some people say why do I have to get baptized? It's like that is the wrong question. It's what can I possibly do to thank the Lord for this incredible gift of offering me this baptism or this sacrament rather than, ah, I have to go to church this Sunday. No you don't. It – God is not up in heaven saying I'm going to be hurt if you don't go to church. He gave us the opportunity to go to church because we've been hurt and because we've hurt others.

I was born and reared in Missouri, where much of the early history of this church took place. But I had never heard anything about the Mormon church. I was looking for the truth, and although I had read the Bible and believed that Jesus Christ had lived on the earth and had been resurrected, yet I had so many unanswered questions—questions such as: Why doesn't God speak to man today as he did anciently when the Bible was being written? How can Jesus be his own father and the Holy Ghost too? Why did Jesus have to be baptized when he had no sin? Where was I before I was born, and where do I go when I die? How can just believing in Christ save me when I haven't kept God's Ten Commandments?

I knew there must be answers that I had not heard. The answers came when Elders Ted Raban and Ronald Flygare knocked on my door in San Diego, California, in July 1951.

During this interview, baptismal candidates are asked whether they have a heartfelt testimony of the fundamental doctrine of the Church. All baptismal candidates also must declare whether they currently keep, and will continue to keep, God's commandments through their lives.

Baptism is required for Church membership. It represents a covenant with God whereby the candidate agrees to follow Christ and live his commandments. The requirements for baptism are described in the Doctrine and Covenants as follows: ""All those who humble themselves before God, and desire to be baptized, and come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, and witness before the church that they have truly repented of all their sins, and are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end, and truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins, shall be received by baptism into his church"" (D&C 20:37). Baptism symbolizes the washing away of sins as well as a rebirth and the beginning of a new life on earth leading to eternal life with God.

Baptism is followed by confirmation into the Church by the laying on of hands of one holding the Melchizedek Priesthood. During this ordinance, the new convert is confirmed a member of the Church and receives the gift of the Holy Ghost. This is typically a momentous and joyous occasion for all involved. Following his confirmation the convert is presented for acceptance by the local membership as a member in full fellowship and embarks on a life of spiritual growth through obedience to the laws of God and activity and service in the Church.",3

""Notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments"" (2 Ne. 31:7).

Born of a mortal mother, Jesus was baptized to fulfill His Father's commandment that sons and daughters of God should be baptized. He set the example for all of us to humble ourselves before our Heavenly Father. We are all welcome to come into the waters of baptism. He was baptized to witness to His Father that He would be obedient in keeping His commandments. He was baptized to show us that we should receive the gift of the Holy Ghost (see 2 Ne. 31:4–9).

As we follow the example of Jesus, we, too, demonstrate that we will repent and be obedient in keeping the commandments of our Father in Heaven. We humble ourselves with a broken heart and a contrite spirit as we recognize our sins and seek forgiveness of our trespasses (see 3 Ne. 9:20). We covenant that we are willing to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ and always remember Him.

""For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.

""And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life"" (2 Ne. 31:17–18).

This is the promise that we were given when we came into the kingdom through baptism and when hands were laid upon our heads, the gift of the Holy Ghost was bestowed upon us, and we were confirmed members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—which means we became ""fellowcitizens with the saints"" in the ""household of God"" (see Eph. 2:19) and should walk in a newness of life (see Rom. 6:4).",3

His baptism marks the beginning of his mortal ministry and the Father's voice on that occasion was a heavenly sign to many of Jesus's followers that Jesus is the Father's ""beloved son."" But the reason Jesus needed to be baptized and the purpose of baptism itself is left somewhat vague in the New Testament.

Burial in the water and arising out of the water symbolize the candidate's faith in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, as well as the future resurrection of all people. It also represents the candidate's new birth to a life in Christ, being born of God, thus born again of the water and of the spirit (Rom. 6:3-6; Mosiah 18:13-14; Moses 6:59-60; D&C 128:12-13).

Latter-day Saint scriptures indicate that the history of this ordinance predates the ministry of John the Baptist. Beginning with Adam (Moses 6:64-66), baptism by immersion in water was introduced as standard practice, and has been observed in all subsequent dispensations of the gospel when priesthood authority was on the earth (D&C 20:25-27;84:27-28). For variants of such precedents, Latter-day Saints trace the baptismal initiations in many pre-Christian religions (see Meslin, 1987). As recorded in the Book of Mormon, Lehi and Nephi 1 foresaw the baptism of Jesus Christ in vision and taught their people to follow his righteous example (1 Ne. 10:7-10;11:27; 2 Ne. 31:4-9). Moreover, before the time of Jesus Christ, Alma 1 initiated converts into the church of God by baptism as a sign of their covenant (Mosiah 18:8-17; Alma 4:4-5).",3

The Book of Mormon teaches, ""Unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of the living God, he cannot be saved"" (2 Ne. 31:16).

The experiences of the last two years have made me stronger in spirit and have given me courage to testify more boldly to the world the deep feelings of my heart. I stand before you today with a resolve to teach the gospel principles like the prophets of old—without the fear of man, speaking clearly with plain talk, and teaching simple gospel truths.

In that spirit, I wish to speak on the ordinance of baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, which takes us out of this world and into the kingdom of God.

There is a familiar phrase: to be *in* the world, but not *of* the world (see John 17:11, 14–17). Our mortal existence is necessary to fulfill the plan of salvation. We must therefore live in this world, but we must also resist the worldly influences that are ever before us.

Jesus taught, ""My kingdom is not of this world"" (John 18:36). These words led me to ponder more concerning His kingdom. I concluded that when we are baptized by immersion by one with the proper priesthood authority and choose to follow our Savior, we then are *in* His kingdom and *of* His kingdom.

Being of the kingdom of God requires that we heed the Savior's admonition ""Follow thou me"" (2 Ne. 31:10). Nephi taught that we follow Jesus by keeping Heavenly Father's commandments: ""Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?""

Latter-day Saints value the Bible for many reasons. The Bible presents the revelations of God in several dispensations or eras, each headed by prophets. They also read and follow the Bible for the instructional and spiritual value of the events it describes. While some of the Old Testament describes the Law of Moses that Latter-day Saints believe was fulfilled with the Atonement of Christ (3 Ne. 9:17), nevertheless the Old Testament stories, commandments, ordinances, proverbs, and prophetic writings still express the basic patterns of God's will toward his children and how they should act toward him.

Latter-day Saints revere the New Testament for its account of the birth, ministry, Atonement, and resurrection of the Savior, Jesus Christ. The teachings of Jesus in the New Testament comprise the core of LDS doctrine, and their preeminence is evidenced by their frequent appearance in other LDS standard works accepted as scripture and in LDS speaking and writing.

The writings of the New Testament apostles are accepted and appreciated for their doctrine and wise and inspired counsel and for documenting the apostolic challenge of proclaiming the gospel, adhering to the original teachings of Christ, establishing the unity of the faith, and promoting the righteousness of believers in a rapidly growing Church. Latter-day Saints also find references in several letters of the early apostles of the falling away (see Apostasy) that necessitated the restoration, alerting the faithful to remain fervent and active in the faith and to stay true to the love of Jesus Christ.",3

We believe the Bible to be the word of God, but I have often asked missionaries what they would do without the Book of Mormon and modern revelation. With just the Bible, what would be their approach? The Prophet Joseph answered it. ""Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations and where is our religion? We have none."" (HC, 2:52.)

If the Book of Mormon is not true, then Joseph Smith was not a prophet of God. I testify to you that the Book of Mormon is true and that the revelations contained in the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price and other places are true and of the Lord. Our message to the world is that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that God has revealed himself to man in this dispensation and restored his gospel with all its keys and power. Nothing will be more certain to build faith and testimonies of members and touch the hearts of honest seekers for the truth than this great book.

8 In 1842, when these articles were written, the Church accepted three books as scripture: the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the Doctrine and Covenants. In the Wentworth Letter the Prophet emphasized that the Book of Mormon was to ""be united with the Bible for the ac- complishment of the purposes of God in the last days."" Although not mentioned in this article, the Doctrine and Covenants as a book of living scripture—a book of current, ongoing reve- lation—is implicitly assumed in the next article.

This article rejects the Protestant doctrine of sola scriptura, or the belief that scripture alone is sufficient for establishing doctrine and authority in the church. One of the truths the Prophet learned through his revelations and work on the ""new translation"" or revision of the Bible from 1830 to 1833 is that the Bible is on its own insufficient and suffered from errors of translation, transmission, and interpretation (all three of these concepts are assumed under the Prophet's use of the word ""translation"" in this article).

They acknowledge that though the messages of scripture are divine in origin and impetus, the words in which they are clothed are from humans (cf. Morm. 8:16-17; Ether 12:23-27).

To help bring this oneness about, the Lord established a divine law of witnesses. Paul taught, ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Corinthians 13:1).

The Bible is one witness of Jesus Christ; the Book of Mormon is another. Why is this second witness so crucial? The following illustration may help: How many straight lines can you draw through a single point on a piece of paper? The answer is infinite. For a moment, suppose that single point represents the Bible and that hundreds of those straight lines drawn through that point represent different interpretations of the Bible and that each of those interpretations represents a different church.

What happens, however, if on that piece of paper there is a second point representing the Book of Mormon? How many straight lines could you draw between these two reference points: the Bible and the Book of Mormon? Only one. Only one interpretation of Christ's doctrines survives the testimony of these two witnesses.",2

The Book of Mormon, however, eliminates all doubt on that subject: ""And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptized in his name, … or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God"" (2 Nephi 9:23).

There exist various modes of baptisms in the world today even though the Bible tells us the manner in which the Savior, our great Exemplar, was baptized: ""[He] went up straightway out of the water"" (Matthew 3:16).

No wonder the Book of Mormon proclaims with boldness, ""And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ"" (2 Nephi 33:10).

The Bible is primarily a record of God's dealings with the forebears and descendants of Jacob or Israel in the ancient Near East. Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of God's dealings principally with another group of Israelites he brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem about 600 B.C. (see Lehi). They anticipated the birth and coming of Jesus Christ and believed in his Atonement and gospel. Their complex, lengthy records were abridged by a prophet named Mormon, inscribed on plates of gold, and buried by his son, Moroni 2, after internecine wars destroyed all of the believers in Christ in the New World except Moroni (A.D. 385).",2

First, it tells in a plain manner of Christ and his gospel. It testifies of his divinity and of the necessity for a Redeemer and the need of our putting trust in him. It bears witness of the Fall and the Atonement and the first principles of the gospel, including our need of a broken heart and a contrite spirit and a spiritual rebirth. It proclaims we must endure to the end in righteousness and live the moral life of a Saint.

Second, the Book of Mormon exposes the enemies of Christ. It confounds false doctrines and lays down contention. (See 2 Ne. 3:12.) It fortifies the humble followers of Christ against the evil designs, strategies, and doctrines of the devil in our day. The type of apostates in the Book of Mormon are similar to the type we have today. God, with his infinite foreknowledge, so molded the Book of Mormon that we might see the error and know how to combat false educational, political, religious, and philosophical concepts of our time.

Now God expects us to use the Book of Mormon in several ways. We are to read it ourselves—carefully, prayerfully—and ponder as we read, as to whether this book is the work of God or of an unlearned youth. And then when we are finished reading the things in the book, Moroni exhorts us to put them to the test in these words:

""And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.""

Joseph was surprised to hear the minister say that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days, that all such things had ceased. (See JS—H 1:21.)

This remark symbolizes practically all of the objections that have ever been made against the Church by nonmembers and dissident members alike. Namely, they do not believe that God reveals his will today to the Church through prophets of God. All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage, seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation. Here, then, is a procedure to handle most objections through the use of the Book of Mormon.

First, understand the objection.

Second, give the answer from revelation.

Third, show how the correctness of the answer really depends on whether or not we have modern revelation through modern prophets.

Fourth, explain that whether or not we have modern prophets and revelation really depends on whether the Book of Mormon is true.

Therefore, the only problem the objector has to resolve for himself is whether the Book of Mormon is true. For if the Book of Mormon is true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a prophet receiving revelation.",0

Mormon 7:8–9 — The Record That Shall Come Forth from the Jews Unto the Gentiles In referring to the gospel of Jesus Christ, Mormon then prophesied of the coming of the Bible through the Jews to the Gentiles, and thence to the descendants of the Nephites and Lamanites. He stated that if his audience believed his records, they ""will believe that [namely, the Bible]."" He knew that this would be one of the great missions of the Book of Mormon—to help establish the truth of the Bible. Doctrine and Covenants 20:11 similarly says that one of the main missions of the Book of Mormon is ""proving to the world that the holy scriptures [including the Bible] are true.""

Latter-day Saints, however, often reverse this logic, using the Bible to prove that Joseph Smith was a prophet and to bolster other parts of the restored gospel, which it indeed does. But, if the Book of Mormon is intended, according to Mormon, to prove that the Bible is true, the logic should run primarily in that direction. By knowing that the Book of Mormon is good and true, one can then know even better and more surely that the Bible is true. And in a day such as ours, when many people have lost faith in the credibility of the Bible, the strength of the Book of Mormon should only be welcomed as an enhancing ally. Increasingly today, the Book of Mormon may be the first introduction that many people coming from a non-Judeo-Christian background will have to the Bible in general and the Gospel of Jesus Christ in particular.

Reciprocally, as Mormon also expects, belief in the Bible can also enhance belief in the Book of Mormon. How can we help fulfill this two-way interactivity? It takes conscious attention and effort to realize and show how extensively and how meaningfully these two ""sticks"" of scripture do and should, indeed, become one in our hands, as Ezekiel 37 prophesies that they are intended to become.",3

In 1820 a New Testament passage in the epistle of James prompted the young Joseph Smith to ask God about the religions of his time, and thereupon he received his first vision, in which he saw God the Father and Jesus Christ (James 1:5; JS-H 1:11-12, 17-18). Three years later, Old Testament and New Testament passages provided the principal scriptural foundation of Joseph's second major spiritual experience when the angel Moroni appeared to him and taught him from Malachi, Isaiah, Joel, Daniel, and other scriptures (JS-H 1:36-41; JD 24:241; *Messenger and Advocate* 1 [Apr. 1835]:109). After completing the Book of Mormon Translation and organizing the restored Church of Jesus Christ in 1830, the Prophet Joseph Smith thoroughly studied the Bible as instructed by the Lord and prepared the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible (JST).

From childhood, Latter-day Saints are introduced to the teachings of the Bible. Certain passages are emphasized in teaching children. Most children in primary-and particularly those in families who hold Family Home Evening and follow scripture reading programs-become familiar with the events recorded in Genesis, including stories of Adam and Eve, Noah, Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph. Later episodes of the prophets, judges, and kings (such as Moses, Samson, Samuel, David, Solomon, Jonah, and Daniel), as well as those of New Testament personalities (e.g., Peter, Paul, and Stephen), are also favorites. The stories of Deborah, Ruth, Esther, and Mary are especially loved by girls. However, the life and teachings of Jesus Christ are the most studied and appreciated (see Jesus Christ: Ministry of Jesus Christ).",3

The book of Abraham also contains teachings of Jehovah, or Christ. In chapter 3, Jehovah compares the nature of the universe to the variety of spirits, or intelligences, that inhabit the universe. Recounting God's dealings with people inhabiting the American continent, the Book of Mormon also preserves sayings given to their prophets. In addition to specific words from ""the Son"" recorded by Nephi 1 (2 Ne. 31:12, 14) and others (e.g., Moroni 2 in Ether 12:26-28), Jesus' words spoken to the people of the Western Hemisphere soon after his resurrection also appear. Besides a discourse similar to the Sermon on the Mount recorded in Matthew 5-7 (3 Ne. 12-14), the risen Jesus spoke of baptism (3 Ne. 11), the Sacrament (chap. 18), the gathering of Israel, and the helping role of the gentiles (chaps. 16, 20-21).",0

President Joseph Fielding Smith taught, ""My words, and the teachings of any other member of the Church, high or low, if they do not square with the revelations, we need not accept them&#133;. We have accepted the four standard works as the measuring yardsticks, or balances, by which we measure every man's doctrine"" (*DS* 3:203).

While the Church views its scriptures as a canon in a strict sense, they are not viewed as closed. The doctrine of continuing revelation is one of the fundamental beliefs of the Church. As was expressed by Joseph Smith, ""We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God"" (A of F 9). While accepting ""all that God has revealed,"" whether canonized in the scriptures or not, Latter-day Saints also believe that revelation continues to enlighten their leaders. Moreover, additional divine guidance is anticipated because God ""will yet reveal many great and important things."" Those future revelations will be scripture, according to the broad definition, and it is likely that some of them will be added to the scriptures in due time.",2

The Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price, brought forth in modern times by the Prophet Joseph Smith, are likewise accepted as the word of God (see *MD*, p. 364).

""We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God"" (A of F 9).

In the face of unanswered questions, the restriction created tension between these truths:

* The Lord invites all to come to him, black and white, and all of us are alike to God, beloved children (2 Ne 26:33).
* Apostles are commissioned to take the gospel to everyone.
* A race-based restriction existed.

Those co-existing facts created a theological problem. ""A contradictory and confusing legacy of racist religious folklore"" grew up to address the problem. People are black, this way of thinking went, because they chose to be less valiant in the premortal world.5 That satisfied some people, but mainly it complicated the problem.

Indeed, that is the very purpose of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—to invite, encourage, and assist all of God's children, both living and dead, to come to Christ and ""lay hold upon every good gift"" (Moro. 10:30), that ""ye may receive a remission of your sins, and be filled with the Holy Ghost, that ye may be numbered with my people who are of the house of Israel"" (3 Ne. 30:2).

That is why we do missionary work. That divine purpose explains why the risen Savior proclaimed to his chosen Apostles that they, after receiving the Holy Ghost, should be witnesses unto him ""both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth"" (Acts 1:8).

That phrase, ""unto the uttermost part of the earth,"" was very much in my mind a few weeks ago as I was privileged to accompany Elder Marvin J. Ashton of the Council of the Twelve to a great, green land I dearly love—the continent of Africa. Under authority of the holy Apostleship, Elder Ashton dedicated two west African countries—Liberia and Ivory Coast—and one in central Africa—Zaire—to the work of the Lord and the preaching of the fulness of the gospel of Christ. Those countries join others in so-called ""Black Africa,"" where the great work of bringing souls to Christ has already commenced. The time of harvest has come.

That testimony grew in my heart as a missionary when I read the New Testament and the Book of Mormon, which further bore witness of Him. That knowledge became the foundation of my life, standing on the footings of the answered prayers of my childhood.

The bursting of the gospel light upon Africa is a great manifestation and testimony of God's love for all of his children. In the words of the Nephite prophet Ammon, He is ""mindful of every people, whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy are over all the earth"" (Alma 26:37).

We know from the testimony of Peter that ""God is no respecter of persons:

""But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him"" (Acts 10:34–35).

Nephi recorded that ""the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; he that is righteous is favored of God"" (1 Ne. 17:35), for ""he doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth them *all* to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth *none* that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; … and *all* are alike unto God"" (2 Ne. 26:33; italics added).

""He gathereth his children from the four quarters of the earth; and he numbereth his sheep, and they know him; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd; and he shall feed his sheep, and in him they shall find pasture"" (1 Ne. 22:25).",0

Across Africa, to join a Sunday School, auxiliary, or priesthood class is a sacred experience, where the Church curriculum is followed and there is great gospel understanding, teaching, and learning by the Spirit.

The gospel in Africa is going to a happy people, very unencumbered by the trappings that affect the lives of many in the West. They are not concerned about having endless material possessions.

It has been said of Africans that they have very little of that which matters least and a great deal of that which matters most. They have little interest in enormous homes and the finest cars but great interest in knowing their Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, and in having eternal families. As a natural result of their faith, the Lord is lifting them in meaningful ways.

Knowing them as we do, we are not surprised that they would be such an important part of the expansion of the Church of Jesus Christ in the last days. Given that Daniel, the Old Testament prophet, envisioned the kingdom of God in the last days ""roll[ing] forth unto the ends of the earth, as [a] stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands [would] roll forth, until it [had] filled the whole earth"" (D&C 65:2), it is very fitting that our wonderful African brothers and sisters would be an important part of the fulfillment of that prophecy and that the revelations making it so would follow the Lord's established patterns.",1

And because they desired it God hath done it, that they may stumble. [Emphasis added]

I read this as saying, ""You don't like plain language, Israel? You want things you can't understand? You want to look beyond the mark? All right, your wish is granted. Now you get to see what happens when you decide to do things your way instead of God's.""

This same principle comes into play when Joseph Smith petitions the Lord three times to allow Martin Harris to show the 116 pages of the Book of Mormon to his wife. The Lord says no twice. The third answer is different, but not because the Lord has changed his mind. Rather, it's because the Lord knew that Joseph was not willing to use his agency the way the Lord wanted, so the Lord turned that defiance into an opportunity to teach an important lesson. The stumbling taught Joseph obedience from that point forward.

Back to the issue at hand: we have no record of any revelation denying the priesthood to people of African descent. Instead, we have Brigham Young perpetuating the folk doctrine of the 19th Century which originated out of the Church that black people bear the curse of Cain. There's also evidence of a campaign to ""otherize"" early Mormons as a different, even sub- human, race.

Life Magazine's 1904 ""otherizing"" anti-Mormon cartoon with oﬀensive racial overtones.
At the time, all the nations, even the oppressed ones, believed that races were part of a hierarchy of greater and lesser humans, and intermarriage was an unspeakable horror.

They were delaying baptism wrongly, so they could treat it as a last unction before death and not worry about living sinful lives. The reaction of the church leader in Rome was to begin baptizing everyone as infants to solve that problem. In their attempt to solve one problem, they created a new one. Christian theologians would rationalize infant baptism as a sign of the covenant, just as circumcision of infant boys eight days after birth had become a sign of the covenant of God with Abraham among the Jews. But that was always understood as a birthright, not as a rebirth following the remission of sins.

Did Something Similar Happen to Cause This Change in the Nephite World? From the Nephite world, there is no information about why they began infant baptism, but a totally new pattern had arisen, and Mormon was astonished, even offended by it. He was appalled at how wrongly they were thinking.",0

Perhaps some parents were getting really worried that their children were going to die. They were starving and were heading for gruesome times of warfare that did not spare the children. Parents may have been afraid that the children would never get a chance to be baptized. This may have been well intended. There are usually motivations that cause such changes, but whatever motivated this practice, Mormon did not like it. Can there be any doubt that Mormon thought that this was a bad idea? Look at the words he used, ""A gross error,"" ""a solemn mockery,"" used twice. He claimed that anyone who would do this was in the gall of bitterness. He saw this as an awful wickedness.

Mormon was most concerned because infant baptism very clearly denies the whole process of repentance that allows the whole process of the mercy of Christ to operate. It abrogates the whole purpose of Christ's Atonement, and thus it creates a bigger problem within the entire church. If people are not willing to teach their children to repent so that they can be baptized and then they cease repenting, wicked conditions would certainly ensue.
Mormon's response leads to an important question: What does a person's attitude about the baptism of little children reveal about a person's spiritual state and his understanding of the gospel? Mormon wanted people to understand how the gospel really worked. He declared that they were denying Christ's Atonement by not recognizing that children are alive in Christ.

Possibly the most important take away is that the Book of Mormon's music repeatedly praises the Lord for His power to deliver His people from physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual dangers. Music and song can even act as a metaphor for Christ's Atonement. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland declared that the ""most precious anthem of all [is] 'the song of redeeming love.'""15

> ""Fortunately, the seats for this particular number are limitless. […] In short, there is a place for everyone who loves God and honors His commandments as the inviolable measuring rod for personal behavior, for if love of God is the melody of our shared song, surely our common quest to obey Him is the indispensable harmony in it.""16

Regardless of anyone's musical ability, the Book of Mormon teaches that the most important song to sing is the song of Christ's redeeming love. If people embrace the Savior's Atonement and live their days singing the song of His redeeming love, the day will come when their souls—like the ""immortal spirit"" of King Benjamin—""may join the choirs above in singing the praises of a just God"" (Mosiah 2:28).

Failing to recognize these musical elements and spiritual themes leaves any performance of the Book of Mormon incomplete and inadequate, whether public or private, whether in the narrow gate or on the broad way.

With this foundation, the Prophet formed a Church ""singing department"" in 1835 to teach note reading and vocal technique. In Nauvoo, and later in Utah, musical standards rose as several well-trained British musicians were converted to the Church and immigrated to the United States. These converts helped establish the propriety of instrumental music for worship, a matter not addressed in the 1830 revelation. Although congregational and choral singing clearly prevailed in the Church, instrumental music soon came to accompany it. Wind, brass, and string bands also proliferated in LDS culture, accompanying the military, recreational, and civic exercises of the Saints.

In pioneer Utah several relatively short-lived associations, including the Deseret Musical Association and the Deseret Philharmonic Society, collected musical scores, created a territorial roster of musicians, and disseminated new pedagogical techniques. At the same time, the Saints founded a number of musical businesses that imported instruments and sheet music into the Great Basin in Utah. Meanwhile, Brigham Young sent some of the Church's most skilled musicians, notably C. J. Thomas, on colonizing missions in the 1860s to ensure that the art would flourish even in outlying LDS settlements. From the 1870s through 1920, the Sunday School and other Church auxiliaries gradually assumed leadership in musical training, providing singing lessons and band memberships for young Latter-day Saints as well as publishing a large amount of newly composed music.",1

Emma Smith, Joseph's wife, collected and published in 1835 the first hymnal, which was actually a diminutive volume of poetry (music was borrowed from popular or favorite melodies). The settlers continued their musical tradition in the intermountain West. Only two weeks after their arrival, the nucleus of what would become the tabernacle choir formed around a group of English and Welsh singers. As pioneering progressed, President Young insisted that each colonizing party have a music leader, called ""musical missionaries,"" to sing, lead choirs, and play instruments in outlying settlements. He personally subsidized the Nauvoo Brass Band, which became a prototype. By the 1860s there were at least forty bands in the territory; by 1875 there were twice that number. Travelers Jules Remy and Julius Benchley were impressed. ""Mormons have a feeling for sacred music,"" they concluded. ""Their women [particularly] sing with soul"" (A Journey to Great-Salt-Lake City, 1861, 2:56, 374-75).",2

It was clearly part of the religious tradition of ancient Israel that continued not only into Book of Mormon practice, but also into that of later Jewish and Christian groups. Language from the Psalms can be found throughout the Book of Mormon and New Testament, which shows how memorable and important the words of these hymns were in the lives of ancient Israelites and early Christians. What is interesting to ask is *why* it was an important part of worship services. Beyond the fact that it was tradition and encouraged by the Scriptures, three significant reasons may be:

1) Composing and singing hymns was believed to be inspired by the Spirit and also to bring the Spirit. A Psalms scroll from Qumran declares that David was given the Spirit and that ""he uttered all these [hymns] through prophecy which was given him from before the Most High"" (11QPsa 27:4–11).

This idea that David's psalms/hymns were inspired by the Spirit (by prophecy) appears to have continued into Christian belief.6 Furthermore, Dr. Barker has suggested that the singing of hymns was a way to invoke the Spirit, or presence, of the Lord.7 These notions fit well with Moroni's comment that the church sang hymns ""as the power of the Holy Ghost led them"" (Moroni 6:9).

2) Singing hymns was apparently done in imitation of the angels in heaven. LDS scholar John Tvedtnes argued that when King Benjamin mentioned wanting to ""join the choirs above"" (Mosiah 2:28), it is likely that he was speaking at the Nephite celebration of the Israelite Feast of Tabernacles, ""when a choir of Levites sang in imitation of the choir of angels.""8",3

Although the style may seem tedious or repetitive at times, there are order, purpose, and clarity in its language. Its words are often as beautiful and as memorable as passages in the Psalms, the Gospel of John, and other notable religious works of prose and poetry.

Most faithful readers of the Book of Mormon, however, do not define or limit themselves to any single approach or methodology, for these approaches are all transcended by the overriding implications of the book's divine origins and eternal purposes. Study and faith, reflection and application, all help a person know and comprehend the messages of the Book of Mormon.

The diversity of styles in the Church is echoed in the diversity of roles that music plays in LDS life.

As in many churches, congregational hymns open and close most ecclesiastical gatherings. In many LDS meetings instrumental music (most often organ) provides preludes, interludes, and postludes. Choral music is produced by many ward and stake choirs, and the Church's well-known Mormon Tabernacle Choir is heard internationally on the weekly ""Music and the Spoken Word"" broadcast. Music also brightens most ward and stake social activities, such as cultural nights, parties, pageants, roadshows, dances and dance festivals, as well as family reunions and family home evenings. Music of various styles regularly enhances Church productions designed to educate and proselytize through mass media, including audio and video tapes, films, filmstrips, commercials and programs for radio and television. Amid this diversity of musical endeavors, composers and performers usually follow the cooperative principles of early Mormonism, giving of their talents in anticipation of spiritual rewards-and also for their own enjoyment.",1

Its main purposes are summarized on its title page: to show the remnants of the Book of Mormon people what great things God did for their forefathers, to make known the covenants of the Lord, and to convince ""Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations."" The central event in the Book of Mormon is the appearance of the resurrected Christ to righteous inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere after his ascension into heaven at Jerusalem. During his visit, Christ delivered a sermon that is similar to the Sermon on the Mount recorded in the New Testament, but with certain vital clarifications and additions. He declared his doctrine, the fulness of his gospel necessary to enter the kingdom of God; and he established his Church with its essential ordinances, and ordained disciples to preside over the Church. At this time, Christ also explained the promises of God to Israel; healed the sick and disabled; blessed the children and their parents; and expressed his great love, allowing each individual to come forward and touch the wounds he had received during his crucifixion (see 3 Ne. 11-26). The record of Jesus' visit and many other passages in the Book of Mormon verify the divine sonship, ministry, Atonement, resurrection, and eternal status of the Lord Jesus Christ and show that the fulness of his gospel is the same for all people, whenever and wherever they have lived.",1

Would you like to have emblazoned on your soul an undeniable witness that the Savior descended beneath your sins and that there is no sin, no mortal plight outside the merciful reach of His Atonement—that for each of your struggles He has a remedy of superior healing power? Then read the Book of Mormon. It will teach you and testify to you that Christ's Atonement is infinite because it circumscribes and encompasses and transcends every finite frailty known to man. That is why the prophet Mormon declared, ""Ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ"" (Moroni 7:41).

No wonder the Book of Mormon proclaims with boldness, ""And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ"" (2 Nephi 33:10). Together with the Bible, the Book of Mormon is an indispensable witness of the doctrines of Christ and His divinity. Together with the Bible, it ""teach[es] all men that they should do good"" (2 Nephi 33:10). And together with the Bible, it brings us to ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism.""

We believe the Bible to be the word of God, but I have often asked missionaries what they would do without the Book of Mormon and modern revelation. With just the Bible, what would be their approach? The Prophet Joseph answered it. ""Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations and where is our religion? We have none."" (HC, 2:52.)

If the Book of Mormon is not true, then Joseph Smith was not a prophet of God. I testify to you that the Book of Mormon is true and that the revelations contained in the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price and other places are true and of the Lord. Our message to the world is that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that God has revealed himself to man in this dispensation and restored his gospel with all its keys and power. Nothing will be more certain to build faith and testimonies of members and touch the hearts of honest seekers for the truth than this great book.

There is a special power about the Book of Mormon. It bears a strong, silent witness of its truth as one reads it.

Parley P. Pratt stated, ""The Spirit of the Lord came upon me, while I read [The Book of Mormon], and enlightened my mind, convinced my judgment, and rivetted the truth upon my understanding, so that I knew that the book was true, just as well as a man knows the daylight from the dark night."" (Journal of Discourses, 5:194.)

As Joseph Smith wrote later, ""The first sight [of this personage] was as though the house was filled with consuming fire"" (History of the Church, 4:536).

#### Fact checking results: This claim contains propaganda - The author, or the author's source, is providing information or ideas in a slanted way in order to instill a particular attitude or response in the reader

 President Hinckley and other General Authorities knew that the Salamander Letter created problems, yet they openly talked about it. There is no reason why they would have known that Hofmann was a con man and, eventually, a murderer.

**Longer response(s) to criticism:**

* Question: If Gordon B. Hinckley were a true prophet, why did he not discern the nature of the Hofmann forgeries?
* Question: Was President Hinckley suspicious that the Salamander letter might not be authentic?

To teach the message of faith, repentance, and baptism, to bear witness to the divine mission of the Savior, to outline man's relationship to Jesus and to God our Father, to strengthen testimonies, to define doctrine, and to reinforce the teachings of the Christian church. He also instructed the people in their everyday living, and gave warning to the world.

For example, we can all be a little more forgiving. In latter-day revelation the Lord said: ""My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened.

""Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.

""I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men."" (D&C 64:8–10.)

In the majesty of his life and the example of his teachings, Christ gave us much counsel with secure promises always attached. He taught with a grandeur and authority that filled with hope the educated and the ignorant, the wealthy and the poor, the well and the diseased.

His message, as one writer said, ""flowed forth as sweetly and as lavishly to single listeners as to enraptured crowds; and some of its very richest revelations were vouchsafed, neither to rulers nor to multitudes, but to the persecuted outcast of the Jewish synagogue, to the timid inquirer in the lonely midnight, and the frail woman by the noonday well."" His teachings dealt not so much with ceremony and minutia as with the human soul, and human destiny, and human life filled with faith and hope and charity. ""Springing from the depths of holy emotions, it thrilled the being of every listener as with an electric flame."" In a word, his authority was the authority of God. Christ's voice was pure and pervaded with sympathy. Even the severity of his sternest injunctions was expressed with an unutterable love. (Frederic W. Farrar, *The Life of Christ,* Portland, Oreg.: Fountain Publications, 1964, p. 215.)",0

As we know, President Thomas S. Monson has given great emphasis to this direction in his memorable example and teachings about rescuing our fellow men and women.4

In our efforts to rescue and serve, we follow our Savior's unique example and tender teachings about love: ""Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself"" (Matthew 22:39). He even commanded us to love our enemies (see Luke 6:27–28). And in His great teachings at the end of His mortal ministry, He said:

""A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.

""By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another"" (John 13:34–35).

As part of loving one another, Jesus taught that when we are wronged by persons, we should forgive them (see Matthew 18:21–35; Mark 11:25–26; Luke 6:37). While many struggle with this difficult commandment, we all know of inspiring examples of Latter-day Saints who have given loving forgiveness, even for the most serious wrongs. For example, Chris Williams drew upon his faith in Jesus Christ to forgive the drunken driver who caused the death of his wife and two of their children. Only two days after the tragedy and still deeply distraught, this forgiving man, then serving as one of our bishops, said, ""As a disciple of Christ, I had no other choice.""5",0

We want others to know that we believe He is the central figure in all human history. His life and teachings are the heart of the Bible and the other books we consider to be holy scripture. The Old Testament sets the stage for Christ's mortal ministry. The New Testament describes His mortal ministry. The Book of Mormon gives us a second witness of His mortal ministry. He came to earth to declare His gospel as a foundation for all mankind so that all of God's children could learn about Him and His teachings. He then gave His life in order to be our Savior and Redeemer. Only through Jesus Christ is salvation possible. This is why we believe He is the central figure in all human history. Our eternal destiny is always in His hands. It is a glorious thing to believe in Him and accept Him as our Savior, our Lord, and our Master.

We also believe that it is possible only through Christ to find ultimate contentment, hope, and happiness—both in this life and in the eternities. Our doctrine, as taught in the Book of Mormon, emphatically states: ""Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life"" (2 Nephi 31:20).

We declare our belief in Jesus Christ and accept Him as our Savior. He will bless us and guide us in all of our efforts. As we labor here in mortality, He will strengthen us and bring us peace in time of trials. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints walk by faith in Him whose Church it is.

Second, be righteous examples to others. After our declaration of our beliefs, we must follow the counsel given to us in 1 Timothy 4:12: ""But be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.""",0

No temple, no meetinghouse, no seminary or institute facility, no welfare facility, no building or property used in the ecclesiastical operations is under mortgage.

Question 10: *""Is the Church an organization of great wealth as some have maintained?""*

The Church has substantial assets necessary to its program. These assets are primarily in buildings. They are in ward and stake meeting facilities, in schools and seminaries, colleges and institutes. They are in welfare projects. These assets are in mission homes and missionary training centers, temples and family history archives, as well as related activities and facilities all concerned directly with our mission. But it should be recognized that all of these are money-consuming assets and not money-producing assets. They are expensive to build and maintain. They do not produce financial wealth, but they do much to strengthen and build Latter-day Saints.

We have a few income-producing business properties, but the return from these would keep the Church going only for a very brief time. Tithing is the Lord's law of finance. There is no other financial law like it. It is a principle given with a promise, spoken by the Lord Himself for the blessing of His children.

I repeat what I have said before—when all is said and done, the only real wealth of the Church is in the faith of its people.

Question 11: *""Why is the Church in commercial enterprises?""*

Essentially, the business assets which the Church has today are an outgrowth of enterprises which were begun in the pioneer era of our history when we were isolated in the West. When there was no longer a need for a number of these, they were disposed of. The remaining number are relatively few.",3

""Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you.

""But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.

""And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches … to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted."" (Jacob 2:17–19.)

How blessed we would be if we could pattern our conduct after the Nephites described by Alma:

""And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church."" (Alma 1:30.)

In our day the Lord has warned us sternly, ""And again, I command thee that thou *shalt not covet thine own* property, but impart it freely."" (D&C 19:26, italics added.)

My brethren, we have been too casual about these matters in the past. There is work to do. We need your help to do it. The word is *urgency* and the time is *now.* Many of you have the power to open doors of opportunity for the service of others. May you see this opportunity as a means to wisely use the property with which the Lord has blessed you to help His work and to save your souls. I know many of you already contribute. I know He will keep His promises to you if you will keep your promises to serve. I testify that God lives. Jesus is the Christ. This is His church. This is His earth—and all things in it. We are but stewards over His goods. May we delight to share them, and may we realize the promise that ""he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come."" (D&C 59:23.) In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.",0

For instance, if you look in verse 11, ""It is wisdom in me (and) a commandment I give unto you that ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man his stewardship."" So even though we tend to think of consecration as everybody sharing everything and I can come in and borrow Tyler's tie or take Taylor's shoes, it never worked that way. Everybody agreed to consecrate what they had for the Lord but consecration or consecrate is just a term that means make holy. After it was consecrated, or basically recognized by the Lord, a stewardship was given back to the individual and that stewardship was their private property and the individual was allowed to basically work with what they had and do what they could with it for the benefit of themselves, their family and the larger Church.

Another principle, and this is found in verse 14, is to recognize that everything belongs to God. The Savior here says, ""I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine."" So a second principle of Church finance is to recognize that everything belongs to God, that what we're working with, whether it's our home, the money that we
make from our profession, whatever blessings we've been given, it really, ultimately, belongs to God and we need to think of it in that way, that it's not our personal property, it's God's property that he's loaning to us to help us to build up the kingdom of God.",0

The widow's or child's mite is as important and acceptable as the rich man's offerings. When men, women, and children are honest with God and pay their tithes and offerings, the Lord gives them wisdom whereby they can do as much or more with the remainder than they could if they had not been honest with the Lord. Many times they are blessed and prospered in various ways—spiritually, physically, and mentally, as well as materially. I bear my witness to you that this is true, and I am sure that many of you can bear such a testimony.

Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, ""It is more blessed to give than to receive."" (Acts 20:35.)

What are riches for, then? To be used in doing good. Therefore, let us dedicate our means to the building of the kingdom of God. Let us this day resolve to be honest with the Lord in the payment of our tithes and offerings.

I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, and this is far more important than earthly riches.

And I know that the gospel in its fullness has been restored in this dispensation through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and that there is a living prophet at the head of the Church today, President Joseph Fielding Smith. This is likewise of more value than any amount of earthly wealth.

However, a testimony alone will not save us. It is the keeping of the commandments of God—living the life of a true Latter-day Saint. It is important, then, to appreciate that the gospel has to be lived in order to be fully realized and its power received.

Therefore, let us dispense the means which the Lord has given us to enrich the lives of others who are less fortunate than we are and to build the kingdom of God, that we may make of our life a good gift to God, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.",0

But we are under covenant to live the law of consecration today and you've just gotten through describing some elements of how that works, that we put – anything that I own whether it be my vehicles, my home, any of my possessions, or any of my talents, any of the blessings, the spiritual gifts that God has given me, they become part of what you would call, quote unquote, the bishop's storehouse. If there's a need for a fireside or for a talk and a bishop can call upon you to share from your storehouse of knowledge and study and experience, to consecrate that to the needs, to the circumstances, to the things that are going on in your ward, or at a stake level. And when I go to the fast offering experience or to the humanitarian fund, or tithing, it all comes in. This is the Lord's money and he has given us stewardship over it but we consecrate it to the Lord so it becomes part of this larger consecrated effort to build up the kingdom of God in a variety of ways but the one that he keeps coming back to over and over again is caring for the poor and the needy, making sure that we're not focusing so much on the acquisition of wealth from my kingdom, my little world or my family, that we're turning our back on those who are in want.

I bring you greetings from the greatest group of missionaries in the world. It is a marvelous thing to labor among them and to feel the strength of the Lord as he works through them and the Saints to bring the gospel of Jesus Christ to his children.

The blessing of sharing the gospel message is overwhelming. I am often filled with the feelings I think Paul may have had when he wrote to the saints at Ephesus, regarding his call to serve the Lord:

""Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me …

""Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;

""According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus, our Lord:

""In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.

""For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."" (Eph. 3:7–8, 11–12, 14.)

This same feeling of humble gratitude seems to fill the hearts of every member and missionary who becomes involved in sharing the gospel. As we see the peace and assurance that come to those who receive the gospel, we become more conscious of the great obligation and opportunity we have to share the restored gospel of Jesus Christ with our friends and neighbors, our brothers and sisters.",0

""For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;

""And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;

""And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him."" (D&C 84:36–38.) If you can think of something more exciting than that, I don't know what it would be.

God is a very wealthy personage. We all like to inherit from a wealthy parent and what could be more exciting than to inherit from God, to get everything that God has. Someone has said that thrift is a great virtue, especially in an ancestor. And God has been very thrifty, he has also been very wise and he has been very generous. To begin with, he created us in his own image and has endowed us with a set of his attributes and potentialities, the development of which is one of the purposes for which we live. He desires that every one of us should be rich. He has said: ""… the fulness of the earth is yours …"" (D&C 59:16), and it pleaseth God that he has given all these things unto men to be used with judgment and thanksgiving. He has shared with us the fulness of the treasures of the earth and he desires to share with us the fulness of the treasures of heaven. He wants us to inherit the celestial kingdom and belong to that celestial order of which he himself is a member. And he has said that the greatest of all the gifts of God is the gift of eternal life in his presence.

That knowledge is obtained from the explicit and symbolic teachings of the endowment, and from the whisperings of the Spirit that come as we are desirous to seek and receptive to hear the revelation available to us in that sacred place.

As regards property, Jesus taught that ""a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth"" (Luke 12:15). Consequently, we should not lay up for ourselves ""treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal"" (Matt. 6:19). In other words, the treasures of our hearts—our priorities—should not be what the scriptures call ""riches [and] the vain things of this world"" (Alma 39:14). The ""vain things of [the] world"" include every combination of that worldly quartet of property, pride, prominence, and power. As to all of these, the scriptures remind us that ""you cannot carry them with you"" (Alma 39:14). We should be seeking the kind of treasures the scriptures promise the faithful: ""great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures"" (D&C 89:19).

All around us we have the good examples of those who seek permanent treasures—those who ""hunger and thirst after righteousness"" (Matt. 5:6) and put the kingdom of God first in their lives. Among the most visible such examples are the men and women who set aside their worldly pursuits and even say good-bye to their families to serve missions for the Lord. Tens of thousands of these are young missionaries. In addition, I pay particular tribute to those who serve missions in their mature years, some as mission leaders and some as what we call couple missionaries. Their remarkable service evidences their priorities, and their impressive example is a guide to their families and to all who know them.",0

A group of Zoramites, considered by their fellow congregants to be ""filthiness"" and ""dross""—those are scriptural words—were turned out of their houses of prayer ""because of the coarseness of their [wearing] apparel."" They were, Mormon says, ""poor as to things of the world; and also … poor in heart""13—two conditions that almost always go together. Missionary companions Alma and Amulek counter that reprehensible rejection of the shabbily dressed by telling them that whatever privileges others may deny them, they can always pray—in their fields and in their houses, in their families and in their hearts.14

But then, to this very group who had themselves been turned away, Amulek says, ""After [you] have [prayed], if *[you]* turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, *if [you] have [it],* to those who stand in need—I say unto *you,* … your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and [you] are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.""15 What a stunning reminder that rich *or* poor, we are to ""do what we can"" when others are in need.

Furthermore, I don't know exactly how each of you should fulfill your obligation to those who do not or cannot always help themselves.

30 And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need.

It is not a sacrifice for anyone to go without two meals a month and give the equivalent cost, and even more, to his or her bishop for the care of the needy.

Think, my brethren, of what would happen if the principles of fast day and the fast offering were observed throughout the world. The hungry would be fed, the naked clothed, the homeless sheltered. Our burden of taxes would be lightened. The giver would not suffer but would be blessed by his small abstinence. A new measure of concern and unselfishness would grow in the hearts of people everywhere.

They are in welfare projects. They are in mission homes and missionary training centers. They are in temples, of which we have substantially more than we have ever had in the past, and they are in genealogical facilities. But it should be recognized that all of these are money-consuming assets and not money-producing assets. They are expensive to build and maintain. They do not produce financial wealth, but they do help to produce and strengthen Latter-day Saints. They are only a means to an end. They are physical facilities to accommodate the programs of the Church in our great responsibility to teach the gospel to the world, to build faith and activity among the living membership, and to carry forward the compelling mandate of the Lord concerning the redemption of the dead.

We have a few income-producing business properties, but the return from these would keep the Church going only for a very short time. Tithing is the Lord's law of finance.

One day, somewhat bothered, I came up to my father and said, ""Daddy, why don't you buy me some shoes? Look at these; they're worn out, and you can see my big toe through the hole in the shoe.""

""We'll fix that up,"" he replied and, with some black polish, gave a shine to my shoes. Later on he told me, ""Son, it's fixed up.""

""No,"" I answered, ""you can still see my big toe.""

Those in the outside world wonder how we are able to do so much. They speak and write of the Church as having great wealth and tremendous assets.

We do have assets. We have houses of worship that dot the earth. We are building a large number of new ones every year. We carry on a great program of higher education, of seminaries and institutes. We have an unequaled family history facility. We foster a tremendous missionary organization that entails the maintenance of mission homes and other facilities in addition to the cost of maintaining the missionaries, which is borne by the missionaries themselves and their families. We carry on other programs, all of which require money.

But all of these and more are money consuming and not money creating. It costs a great deal to operate this Church. Its worldwide operations are financed through the consecrated tithes of faithful members. What a wonderful and glorious principle is the law of tithing. It is so simple to understand and follow. It is the Lord's law of finance.

I thank the Lord from the bottom of my heart for the faith of those who pay their honest tithes. Are they the poorer for it? We testify that somehow under the divine providence of the Lord, He makes it up to us and does so generously. It is not a tax. It is a voluntary offering given in confidentiality. It is a principle that carries with it a remarkable promise. God has stated that He will ""open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it"" (Mal. 3:10). That is *His* promise. He has the capacity to fulfill that promise. And it is my testimony that He does so.",1

It is something that will be of value to you all the days of your life and into the eternities. I want to leave to you my testimony—my testimony of the gospel. I know that the gospel is true. I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ.""

It is said that many grandchildren honor the name of that grandmother and recall her testimony with joy. How great are the riches she has laid up in store in our Heavenly Father's kingdom.

I am grateful to the Lord for you members of the Church who desire to share the wealth of the gospel of Jesus Christ with your family and friends. Not only are you becoming rich toward God, but you are making other lives rich also. You are giving them the true Christian religion.

Patrick Henry, a great American patriot, said:

""I have now disposed of all my property to my family. There is one thing more I wish I could give them, and that is the Christian religion. If they had that, and I had not given them one shilling they would have been rich, and if they had not that, and I had given them all the world, they would be poor.""

I answered that the Church is not wealthy but that we follow the ancient biblical principle of tithing, which principle is reemphasized in our modern scripture.

To sustain our leaders is a privilege; it comes coupled with a personal responsibility to share their burden and to be disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Providing for a family is a sacred requirement (1 Tim. 5:8). The mission of the Church in many countries of the world requires considerable resources to sustain Church members in seeking the spiritual growth and perfection of themselves and others. Ignorance, disease, and poverty can be overcome only with the assistance of material assets that result from the wise use of human talent and the resources abundant in nature. Thus the Church and its members seek to obtain the material resources that are needed to build the kingdom of God.

The principles taught in the standard works concerning the accumulation and use of wealth are sufficiently broad to permit an ongoing dialogue among Church members about what is pleasing in the sight of the Lord. Some emphasize that man must work and that the fruits of his labor are his due and right (D&C 31:5). Others point out that although man must work, God makes life and its abundance possible, and thus everything rightly belongs to him (Mosiah 2:21-25) and comes to man ""in the form of trust property"" to be used for God's purposes (S. Richards, *CR* [Apr. 1923]:151). Some suggest that there are no limits on the profits one may gather provided the pursuit is legal and the ultimate utilization is appropriate. Others see business and legal standards of secular society as falling short: ""Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven&#133;. Ye cannot serve God and mammon"" (Matt. 5:20;6:24).

Many have written and given assurances of their love and prayers. We stand in need of that prayerful support every day.

What a privilege it is to serve in the kingdom of God. In this work it is the Spirit that counts—wherever we serve. I know I must rely on the Spirit. Let us obtain that Spirit and be faithful members of the Church, devoted children and parents, effective home teachers, edifying instructors, inspired ward and stake leaders. God bless you all for your noble labors in building the kingdom.

If there be any division among us, let us set aside anything of this kind and join ranks in the great responsibility to move forward the work of the Lord. If there be those who have become disaffected, we reach out to you in the pure love of Christ and stand ready to assist and welcome you back in full fellowship in the Church.

We have a sacred responsibility to fulfill the threefold mission of the Church—first, to teach the gospel to the world; second, to strengthen the membership of the Church wherever they may be; third, to move forward the work of salvation for the dead.

Let us consider each of these in turn.

The world needs the gospel, and we are charged by command of the Lord and through our Abrahamic lineage to spread it. Every young man in this Church should be qualified for a mission and then should go. Many sisters may also serve missions. I am grateful my wife went on a mission and that we have granddaughters and grandsons in the mission field.

There is no greater joy than bringing souls to Christ. Participation in this great work blesses the convert, blesses the missionary, and blesses those who support the missionary.",0

We have seen men and women working to exhaustion from sunrise to sundown for a pittance. Yet their ready smiles and cheerful countenances indicated that they had found some happiness with their lot in life.

Some might say, ""Where is the justice in the fact that some of God's children have so much of health and this world's goods and others so very little?""

It has been so in all dispensations. Paul himself was a welfare worker, in a very modern sense of the term. We find him writing in Romans 15:

""But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.

""For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.

""It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things"" (Rom. 15:25–27).

The obligation of the Church to help its poor is here placed by Paul on a par with communicating spiritual riches to those who are in darkness. By both means we store up treasures in heaven.

""Charge them,"" he says, ""that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;

""That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;

""Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life"" (1 Tim. 6:17–19).

In our day, the Lord has given us this charge:

""If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my commandments.

""And behold, thou wilt remember the poor, and consecrate of thy properties for their support that which thou hast to impart unto them, with a covenant and a deed which cannot be broken.

""And inasmuch as ye impart of your substance unto the poor, ye will do it unto me; and they shall be laid before the bishop of my church and his counselors, two of the elders, or high priests, such as he shall appoint or has appointed and set apart for that purpose"" (D&C 42:29–31).",1

He's basically saying I don't want inequality. We have said this before and I think it's worthwhile to say again, the word inequality actually is the same word as iniquity. If you look up the root of both these words they actually come from the same word. They're actually just variants of the same word. Iniquity drives inequality and inequality leads to iniquity. God has given in abundance but where we separate that abundance out, this is the consequence. And so we have things in the Church to help with that. We've all been given callings. We all get to serve and share of our own personal wealth in the terms of our time and talents to bless the lives of others. There's tithing, there's fast offerings.

The deepest cause of conflict directly or indirectly affecting political relationships between Latter-day Saints and others was the belief in continuing revelation. Non-Mormons viewed the claim of continuing revelation and the social and political forms built on that claim as threats to democratic self-government. While the Book of Mormon was being printed, a mass meeting of Palmyra residents pledged to boycott it. The Prophet Joseph Smith was arrested several times on charges brought, according to his accusers, ""to open the eyes and understanding of those who blindly follow"" him. When the Church was hardly large enough to ""man a farm, or meet a woman with a milk-pail,"" recalled Sidney Rigdon, non-Mormons were already accusing them of wanting ""to upset the Government"" (*HC* 6:289).

The turmoil of the New York period was only a harbinger of intense conflicts to follow. As the practical implications of belief in new revelation and obedience to a new prophet became clear, anti-Mormon opposition intensified. For the Prophet and his followers, divine calling made possible-indeed, morally incumbent-the effort to create a just society, which the revelations called Zion. For non-Mormon neighbors, these efforts constituted challenges that they determined to resist.",3

Almost overnight, it grew from a village of religious refugees and new converts to the point where it rivaled Chicago as the largest city in Illinois. With Democrats and Whigs both vying for the Mormon vote, Nauvoo was granted one of the most liberal city charters in the state, an independent military force, and a strong judicial system (see Nauvoo Charter). However, as in Missouri during the 1830s, natural rivalry with older citizens in neighboring towns like Carthage (the county seat) and Warsaw (the next largest port city) turned to jealousy and hatred as Nauvoo's economic and political power grew (see Nauvoo Economy; Nauvoo Politics).

These tensions coalesced around Joseph Smith. In addition to being prophet and President of the Church, he also served as mayor, commander of the Nauvoo Legion state militia, justice of the peace, and university chancellor. Non-Mormon fears of this concentration of powers were intensified by the Church's belief in the theocratic union of spiritual, economic, and political matters under the priesthood. This and other ""unorthodox"" doctrines, such as continuing revelation, temple ordinances for the living and the dead, new scripture, and plural marriage, further intensified political and economic rivalries.

Illinois anti-Mormons, perhaps assisted by old enemies from Missouri, joined with a handful of determined Mormon defectors within Nauvoo. Several had held high Church positions and, when excommunicated, fueled efforts to destroy Joseph Smith and the Church.",3

The establishment of Zion required the unity of the LDS community in righteousness. The effort brought social, economic, and political innovations, including the gathering of the Saints, consecration and stewardship, the United Order, and plural marriage. In all matters relevant to building Zion, the LDS community looked to the Prophet for guidance, concentrating power, even against his own inclinations, in his hands.

Efforts to establish Zion excited fear and animosity. Made uneasy by ever-increasing numbers of Latter-day Saints and shocked or bemused by their economic and social experiments, many non-Mormons viewed the Saints as alien and hostile, even as a threat to their freedoms as Americans. Because the Church seemed to erase the distinction between church and state-in American liberal political thought an important pillar of liberty-some felt that it portended the rise of religious despotism. The result was recurring political conflict, which time and again threatened the LDS community.",3

Because of the loss of property in earlier persecutions, he was unable to pay his debts and had to fend off creditors. When Illinois political leaders turned against the Latter-day Saints and no national leaders would champion their cause, the Prophet declared his candidacy for president of the United States, gaining a platform from which to discuss the rights of his people (*see* Nauvoo Politics*).*

By April 1844, dissenters openly challenged Joseph Smith's leadership by organizing a reform church and publishing a newspaper, the Nauvoo Expositor, for the purpose of denouncing him. Perceiving the *Expositor* as a threat to the peace of the community, the Nauvoo city council, with Joseph Smith presiding as mayor, authorized him to order the destruction of the press-an act that ignited the opposition. On June 12 the Prophet was charged with riot for destruction of the press. After a flurry of legal maneuvers, Joseph submitted to arrest at nearby Carthage, the county seat, under the governor's pledge of protection. Joseph had premonitions of danger, and the vocal threats of hotheads in adjoining towns gave substance to his fears. On June 27, 1844, while in Carthage Jail awaiting a hearing, Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were killed when a mob with blackened faces stormed the jail (see Martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith).

Beginning soon after his ministry began and continuing throughout his life, Joseph Smith was subjected to approximately thirty criminal actions and at least that many civil suits related to debt collection or failed financial ventures.

The first charge of being a ""disorderly person"" involved treasure hunting for hire, brought against him at South Bainbridge, New York, in 1826 by a disgruntled Methodist preacher related to Josiah Stowell, Joseph's employer. When Stowell refused to testify against him at the trial, Joseph was discharged. In July 1830 in the same venue, Joseph was tried and acquitted by another magistrate on charges of ""being a disorderly person, of setting the county in an uproar by preaching the Book of Mormon, etc."" (*HC* 1:88).

> Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. In the short space of twenty years, he has brought forth the Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift and power of God, and has been the means of publishing it on two continents; has sent the fulness of the everlasting gospel, which it contained, to the four quarters of the earth; has brought forth the revelations and commandments which compose this book of Doctrine and Covenants, and many other wise documents and instructions for the benefit of the children of men; gathered many thousands of the Latter-day Saints, founded a great city, and left a fame and name that cannot be slain. He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the Lord's anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood; and so has his brother Hyrum.

No. I will lift them up and in their own way, too, if I cannot persuade them my way is better"" (*TPJS*, p. 313).

Within the Church two principles taught by Joseph Smith have prevailed: ""I teach the people correct principles and they govern themselves"" (*JD* 10:57-58), and, ""It does not prove that a man is not a good man because he errs in doctrine"" (*HC* 5:340).",0

The men who colluded together to kill Joseph and Hyrum had a diverse and complex set of motives for their actions—thus understanding *why* these two influential leaders were murdered is complex and involves numerous different factors. As Bentley explains:

> Many factors contributed to the Prophet's murder on June 27, 1844. Among these were fear of the Nauvoo Legion's power; perceived abuses related to powers granted under the Nauvoo Charter; political unrest caused by the rapidly increasing Mormon population in Hancock County, Illinois, and Lee County, Iowa; economic competition with some of the leading Mormon opponents; persisting grudges among some Missourians; rumors distorting the beginnings of the limited practice of plural marriage; criticism of Joseph Smith's presidential campaign; and the concentration of legislative, judicial, executive, military, and religious power in one man, Joseph Smith.16

This plan was put into action as early as February 26, 1844, when the Law brothers and their collaborators instituted or appealed a series of lawsuits to Carthage. Already at this point, Joseph suspected a darker plot at work than merely resolving legal differences.4 After those lawsuits were consolidated and dismissed, the dissenters initiated additional legal suits in May. Eventually, some of these were successful in getting Joseph out of Nauvoo, and thus he was in Carthage on May 27, 1844, exactly one month before his martyrdom. On that occasion, Charles Foster—one of the conspirators—evidently had a temporary change of heart and notified Joseph of a plan to have him assassinated the next day.

In reaction to this threat, Joseph declared martial law in Nauvoo, calling out the Nauvoo Legion to protect the city from invasion. The threatened invasion never came, and after Governor Ford met with Joseph's enemies in Warsaw and Carthage, he insisted that Joseph come to Carthage to stand trial yet again for the riot charge. The Governor guaranteed Joseph that he would be protected. However, he insisted on disarming the Nauvoo Legion in order to keep the peace, but did not disarm the other militias at the same time.

Once in Carthage, Joseph and other defendants were arraigned on the riot charge and posted bail when the Higbees deliberately failed to present witnesses and asked for their case to be rescheduled for September. Before Joseph and Hyrum could leave Carthage, however, they were charged with treason for having declared martial law—yet another legal charge that lacked any legal merit, but was useful because treason was a non-bailable offense. This prevented Joseph and Hyrum from leaving, and left them trapped in Carthage Jail, vulnerable to mob action.

Inside the jail, Hyrum read from the book of Ether in the Book of Mormon and Joseph bore a strong testimony to the guards of the truthfulness of the Restoration, of the Book of Mormon, and of the visitations of angels. Outside, the mob, eventually numbering about 2,000, was able to mobilize, with people standing ready to join from Missouri, and then come to Carthage and assassinate Joseph and Hyrum late in the afternoon of June 27, 1844.12",1

Thus, those who revile Joseph Smith will not change Joseph's status with the Lord (see 2 Ne. 3:8)—merely their own! Instead—as was promised Joseph in an 1834 father's blessing:

No one could kill Joseph during that time. He had to get the fullness of temple blessings restored first. But people sure made his life miserable in the meantime. He escaped from his persecutors in spring 1839. As soon as he could, knowing that his days were numbered and he had none to spare, Joseph gathered several of the apostles on June 27, 1839, exactly five years before his violent death at the hands of a murderous mob, and taught the apostles what he had learned a decade earlier from Michael about ""detecting the devil when he appeared as an angel of light"" (D&C 128:20).",2

First, it's not as simple as just Joseph and some of the other early Church leaders lying, the way Jeremy tries to make it seem.

It's incredibly difficult to boil down 15 years' worth of religious, historical, political, and societal events down into something that makes sense for the average person who isn't familiar with any of it, so I'm not even going to try. But we have to understand the climate these people were living in—they'd been shunned by family members for joining the Church; they'd been prevented from voting; they'd been driven from their homes at gunpoint without anything, more than once; they'd been blamed for all of the local unrest simply because they moved into an area and built a farm or city; they and their friends and family members had been starved, robbed, beaten, raped, and murdered; they were held under siege by the state militia; they'd had an extermination order placed against them; and their current situation was beginning to mirror that of Kirtland and Missouri. They were terrified of what might happen to them next. And Joseph and the Twelve were responsible for keeping all of them safe. They knew that if they publicly announced the plural marriage doctrine before they were in a position of relative safety, the Church would be destroyed—literally. The members would all be massacred and the Church would die out because there was no one left to carry it forward. That's what they were facing, and they knew it.",0

But, to the surprise of its enemies, the Church did not die nor did the work of Joseph Smith cease with his mortal death. What has transpired in a century and a half bears eloquent testimony to the eternal nature of the work of this singularly remarkable man, Joseph Smith. The Church which he restored has had dramatic growth in many parts of the earth. It has produced an unequaled missionary system and an unmatched welfare program. Its governing system gives priesthood power and authority from God to all worthy male members, at the same time recognizing the exalted status of women as being equal to men. The Church has an inspired law of health and temporal well-being far ahead of its time. By revelation from God, the Church also possesses those keys, saving principles, and ordinances which will bring eternal exaltation to mankind, living and dead.

He commenced a marvelous missionary effort to the entire world, which today brings light and truth to the souls of mankind. At length, Joseph Smith died the martyr's death, as did his brother Hyrum.

Joseph Smith was a pioneer indeed.

Turning the pages of scriptural history from beginning to end, we learn of the ultimate pioneer—even Jesus Christ. His birth was foretold by the prophets of old; His entry upon the stage of life was announced by an angel. His life and His ministry have transformed the world.

With the birth of the babe in Bethlehem, there emerged a great endowment, a power stronger than weapons, a wealth more lasting than the coins of Caesar. This child was to be the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the Promised Messiah, even Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Born in a stable, cradled in a manger, He came forth from heaven to live on earth as mortal man and to establish the kingdom of God. During His earthly ministry, He taught men the higher law. His glorious gospel reshaped the thinking of the world. He blessed the sick. He caused the lame to walk, the blind to see, the deaf to hear. He even raised the dead to life.",3

In each situation, a peculiar people amid multiple religious traditions and structures engendered hostility.

In and around Palmyra, New York, prior to the organization of the Church, the Smith family was welcomed in the community. But the announcements of new revelation, new scripture, and direct communication with God engendered a negative social reaction. Within a year, the family and all other members of the Church moved from that area. None returned for nearly eighty-five years. Similar hostilities developed in other areas (see Anti-Mormon Publications; Persecution). The missionary outreach of the fledgling Church extended into England, Scandinavia, and western Europe, where churches were mostly state-controlled, and alternative faiths were oppressed. To listen to, sympathize with, or join the Latter-day Saints often meant that one would be disowned by parents and relatives, socially ostracized, fined, jailed, or even in some instances threatened with death. The resulting stream of LDS emigrants to Church settlements in Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois was so extensive that even in the melting-pot atmosphere of America, they were often confronted immediately with suspicion and opposition.

Following its withdrawal from New York, the Church established its headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio. There the vigorous missionary thrust continued to bring into the Church many people with commitment and dedication, leaving little time in their lives for social relationships with those outside the Church, who often shunned friendly overtures when they were made. The reaction of many churches was strongly negative to the LDS influence, and the typical responses of Latter-day Saints was to draw closer to each other for mutual protection and support. Communication was sporadic and fleeting at best. Misunderstandings grew.",1

Latter-day Saints believe that righteously enduring persecution can bring blessings in both this life and the next. Although suffering is as unwelcome to Latter-day Saints as to any other people, they strive to respond with patience and faith and to avoid bitterness or revenge (Matt. 5:43-47; D&C 101:35; cf. 98:23-27).

Although Latter-day Saints claim no greater suffering than many others who have also been persecuted for their religious beliefs through the ages, many Latter-day Saints have been persecuted, beginning with Joseph Smith (see JS-H 1:33). As the Church grew, persecutions increased; the Latter-day Saints faced threats, murder, rape, mayhem, property damage, and revilement in Kirtland, Ohio (1831-1838), in Missouri (1831-1839), and in the area of Nauvoo, Illinois (1839-1846), culminating in the assassinations of Joseph and Hyrum Smith at Carthage, Illinois, in 1844 (Hull, pp. 643-52).

The isolation and safety of the Great Basin in the American West, to which the main body of the Church fled beginning in 1846-1847, lasted only a few years before persecutions were renewed. The Great Basin area became part of the United States in 1848 after the Mexican-American War, and soon federal laws against the practice of plural marriage forced many Latter-day Saints into hiding or to settlements in Mexico and Canada. More than one thousand Latter-day Saints, mostly polygamous husbands, were fined and imprisoned. Ultimately, antipolygamy legislation disenfranchised the Saints and disincorporated the Church, allowing confiscation of Church property. After the 1890 manifesto enjoining plural marriage, anti-Mormon persecution declined substantially, but other hostilities persisted.",2

Many centuries earlier, Moroni had stressed this same point, indicating that the record was a work prepared and consecrated to God for ""the welfare and blessing of the ancient and long dispersed covenant people of the Lord"" (Mormon 8:15). In short, the Book of Mormon was a sacred book. This element of sacredness is a feature shared by other records on metal plates from the ancient world.",3

At the end of four years he was given the plates, which contained a record of God's dealings with the ancient people on the American continent and contained the gospel in its fullness. He translated the engravings on these plates by the gift and power of God and by revelation, and to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.

We have this promise given by Moroni regarding the Book of Mormon:

""And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

""And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things."" (Moro. 10:4–5.)

In September of 1823, he was again visited by a heavenly messenger who told him his name was Moroni and that God had a work for Joseph to do.

The angel told him of a book, written upon gold plates, that was deposited in a nearby hill. The plates contained an account of the former inhabitants of the American continent, and also the fulness of the everlasting gospel as delivered by the Savior to those ancient people. Joseph was instructed to visit the spot where the plates were deposited each year for four years. This he did, and on each occasion he was met and instructed by the angel Moroni until finally he was ready to receive and translate the plates.

If any of you are not already familiar with the story of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, I invite you to avail yourselves of the opportunity to do so. Read the book itself, which contains this promise in the last chapter:

""And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

""And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things"" (Moro. 10:4–5).

It is this power which bears witness to hundreds of thousands of converts each year that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that the Book of Mormon is true, that it is a companion book to the Bible and a new and further witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ and a record of his dealings with the early inhabitants of America.",3

For everyone else, they were often present in the room but veiled by a cloth. This suggests that the plates functioned as a symbol of Jesus Christ, a constant reminder that he was an integral part of the translation process.

Similar imagery can be found in the ancient Israelite tabernacle and temple. Only the high priest on the Day of Atonement was allowed to go beyond the veil and enter into the Holy of Holies—the Lord's symbolic dwelling place (see Leviticus 16:2). For everyone else, the holy of holies, like the plates of the Book of Mormon, was outwardly visible but inwardly inaccessible.34 The sacred space was strictly forbidden, and those who ventured there or engaged in unauthorized activities did so at their own peril.35

Interestingly, the Nephite artifacts—those which Joseph Smith found in a stone box and which were shown to the Three Witnesses—all have parallels to the relics contained in the Israelite Ark of the Covenant, which was located in the Holy of Holies.36 In particular, the Ark stored the Ten Commandments which contained God's commandments inscribed into stone, much like the Book of Mormon contains Christ's words engraved into metal.

Thus, the veiled presence of the plates during the translation may symbolize their status as a holy artifact, comparable to the sacred tablets which contained the word of God in the Old Testament.37 Recognizing these relationships, and also noticing that the timing of Joseph Smith's discovery and retrieval of the plates coincided with relevant ancient Jewish festivals,38 Don Bradley has viewed Joseph as fulfilling a ""role like that of the biblical high priest.""39",3

After four years of waiting, learning, and personal refinement, 21-year-old Joseph Smith was finally entrusted by the angel Moroni with the ancient record that for centuries had lain in waiting in a stone box embedded in a hill near his home. Recalling this time years later, Joseph said that almost as soon as he had received the plates ""the most strenuous exertions were used to get them from me. Every stratagem that could be invented was resorted to for that purpose. The persecution became more bitter and severe than before, and multitudes were on the alert continually to get them from me if possible.""

As for the plates themselves, Emma Smith reported that they ""often lay on the table without any attempt at concealment, wrapped in a small linen table cloth.""4 Other witnesses recalled that on a few occasions the plates were kept ""in a nearby box under the bed or even hidden in the Whitmer's barn during translation.""5

Decades later, however, one of the men involved in digging them up confessed that the plates were a forgery, perpetrated with the intent of fooling Joseph Smith.6, Mormon Portraits (Salt Lake City, 1888), 207–208. This wasn't the only time folks came to Nauvoo with the intent of exposing Joseph Smith as an impostor. A year earlier, in April 1842, Henry Caswell visited Nauvoo and later said he showed Joseph a copy of a medieval Greek manuscript. Joseph allegedly identified the manuscript as Egyptian, which Caswell took as evidence of Joseph's ignorance of ancient languages. For a reasonable assessment of this incident, see John W. Welch, ""Joseph Smith's Awareness of Latin and Greek,"" in Approaching Antiquity: Joseph Smith and the Ancient World, ed. Lincoln H. Blumell, Matthew J. Grey, and Andrew H.

To many, the fact that they weren't more directly implemented in the typically reported translation process is seen as suspicious, incoherent, or persuasive evidence of fraud. Yet, as the foregoing analysis demonstrates, the physical plates functioned in a variety of meaningful ways:

1. Evidence suggests that on some occasions during early stages of the translation, Joseph directly utilized the plates in the dictation process.

2. As a physical object which Joseph Smith had personally seen and knew that he could obtain if he was faithful, the plates no doubt helped motivate him to be worthy of his impending prophetic calling.

3. The plates serve, even today, as an object lesson about prioritizing sacred things over worldly temptations.

4. Characters copied from the plates helped convince Martin Harris of their authenticity.

5. The copied characters also facilitated the fulfillment of a significant Book of Mormon prophecy.

6. The physical presence of the plates helped strengthen the faith of Joseph and his associates that his translation was tied to a genuine ancient artifact created by real ancient prophets.

7. The presence of the plates all but eliminates the possibility that Joseph Smith was merely *mistaken* about his revelatory claims, thereby impelling a choice between truth or fraud, while also leaving no rational grounds for interpreting the Book of Mormon as ""inspired fiction.""

8. The plates function as meaningful evidence of the Restoration, not only because their existence and apparent antiquity are directly affirmed by numerous historical statements, but also because alternative explanations must be strung together by historically unsupported assumptions.",0

In other words, Joseph took preliminary steps toward an *ordinary* translation by comparing the squiggles on these plates to other ancient writings he was familiar with.

He never produced a ""Book of Kinderhook.""20, 490: ""After the first meeting, no further mention was made of translation, and the Kinderhook plates dropped out of sight. Joseph may not have detected the fraud, but he did not swing into a full-fledged translation as he had with the Egyptian scrolls. The trap did not quite spring shut, which foiled the conspirators' original plan. Instead of exposing the plot immediately, as they had probably intended to do, they said nothing until 1879, when one of them signed an affidavit describing the fabrication."""") Whatever Joseph Smith may have thought of the Kinderhook plates, the Lord could not be fooled. God would not and did not reveal a translation of these bogus artifacts.

The more universal message from the Kinderhook incident is that Joseph's ability to translate, like the case of Mosiah's in the Book of Mormon, was a gift from God, and only worked when God enabled him to do His will. The gift of ""the interpretation of languages,"" like all spiritual gifts, ""come[s] by the Spirit of Christ; and they come unto every man severally, according as [Christ] will"" (Moroni 10:16). Like Joseph and Mosiah, we all have gifts from the Lord, which can only be properly used to build-up the kingdom of God. If we try to use these gifts from the Lord for inappropriate or irrelevant purposes, we can expect underwhelming results, like those from the case of the Kinderhook plates.",1

He once explained that ""the Title Page of the Book of Mormon is a literal translation, taken from the very last leaf, on the left-hand side of the collection or book of plates.""8 David Whitmer once stated that while looking into the seer stone, Joseph Smith saw a ""parchment, on which would appear the characters of the plates in a line at the top, and immediately below would appear the translation in English.""9 How well Joseph Smith regularly understood the correlation between the English text and the characters on the plates, however, is uncertain.

Another important consideration is that the presence of the plates helped confirm Joseph Smith's revelatory claims.10: xxiv argues that the presence of the plates makes it difficult to ""contend that there were no Nephites but that Joseph Smith was nonetheless an inspired prophet. If the plates really existed, somebody made them. And if no Nephites existed to make them, then either Joseph Smith, or God, or somebody else seems to have been engaged in simple fraud.

It's interesting to me that she doesn't remember Joseph ever forbidding her from looking at them, though. According to her father, Isaac Hale, Joseph did forbid *him* from seeing them, and that's why he wouldn't allow the plates into his home:

*Soon after this [Joseph and Emma moving to Harmony], I was informed they had brought a wonderful book of Plates down with them. I was shown a box in which it is said they were contained, which had, to all appearances, been used as a glass box of the common sized window glass. I was allowed to feel the weight of the box, and they gave me to understand that the book of plates was then in the box—into which, however, I was not allowed to look.*

*I inquired of Joseph Smith Jr., who was to be the first who would be allowed to see the Book of Plates? He said it was a young child. After this, I became dissatisfied, and informed him that if there was anything in my house of that description which I could not be allowed to see, he must take it away; if he did not, I was determined to see it. After that, the Plates were said to be hid in the woods.*

As soon as they were able, Joseph and Emma moved out of Hale's home and into a smaller cabin elsewhere on his property. This cabin is where they kept the plates and where most of the translation happened.",2

The Three Witnesses were a different story, but there's a reason why they were shown the plates by an angel. If their testimony was exactly the same as that of the Eight Witnesses, critics could claim that Joseph just manufactured the plates himself and there was nothing miraculous about it.

And so, Katharine Smith, we don't always talk about, first female witness of the Book of Mormon to actually handle the plates and get the opportunity to kind of rustle them, though she—she, like, Emma Smith later on, kind of sees the plates within this linen cloth.

Other weird things that happen: One of the weird things that we don't always talk about is how did those three men that attacked Joseph Smith know where he's at? According to Lucy Mack Smith, they hired a guy, using an alternate seer stone. That's how they knew the route Joseph Smith was going to take to the house. Later on, Samuel Lawrence, who's another local from Palmyra, comes to the Smith home and demands the plates. When Joseph says, no you can't have the plates, he returns with another man who has a divining rod. This divining rod person apparently uses his rod and finds where the plates are located, goes to the cooper shop where they had moved the plates to. Joseph Smith had set up a decoy there.

I'm not sure how those six tiny plates were supposed to create a book of 1200 pages, but that was probably local rumor and not anything official. So, again, we can't corroborate this, but it is a secondhand account of Joseph's intentions by one of the guys who fabricated the plates.",1

During their visits that lasted through the night, Moroni told Joseph that God had a marvelous work for him to accomplish—the translation and publication to the world of the inspired words of ancient prophets of the American continent.8 The next day, Joseph went to the place, not far from his home, where the plates were buried by Moroni at the end of his life, centuries earlier. There Joseph saw Moroni again, who instructed him to prepare himself to receive the plates in the future.

Over the next four years, on September 22 of each year, Joseph received additional instructions from Moroni regarding the knowledge about how the Lord's kingdom should be governed in the latter days. Joseph's preparation also included visits from the angels of God, thus unfolding the majesty and glory of the events that would take place in this dispensation.9

His marriage to Emma Hale in 1827 was part of that preparation. She played an important role in helping the Prophet throughout his life and ministry. In fact, in September 1827, Emma accompanied Joseph to the hill where the plates were hidden, and she waited for him as the angel Moroni delivered the record into Joseph's hands. Joseph received the promise that the plates would be preserved if he would devote all his efforts to keep them safe until they should be returned into the hands of Moroni.10",1

| Joseph Smith translating the plates by Robert T. Barrett |

In the book of [Doctrine of Covenants we learn of a story in which the Prophet Joseph Smith was commanded to translate the ancient record of the ancient inhabitants of America. These people knew of Christ and recorded their testimonies about him in what we know of today as the Book of Mormon. As Joseph began to translate this record he was asked by his scribe Martin Harris to allow him to show the completed manuscript to his wife. Joseph was very reluctant to allow Martin to do this, but prayed to the Lord because of Martin's insistencies. First the Lord told Joseph that he was not allowed to give the transcript to Martin. However, after asking two more times the Lord granted Martin Harris the chance to show the documents to his wife and a few other specific people.",1

By the gift and power of God, Joseph translated the record from these plates and published a sacred volume known as the Book of Mormon, which is another testament of Jesus Christ.

This book was published in Palmyra, New York, by E. B. Grandin. The Grandin building is now a visitors' center where the story of the Book of Mormon's publication is told. From this small beginning the Book of Mormon has been published in seventy languages, making it available to 73 percent of the people of the earth.",0

That angel was Moroni, who appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. He directed Joseph to the place where golden plates containing ancient writings were deposited. Joseph Smith then translated these plates by the gift and power of God, and the Book of Mormon was published. This is a record of two groups of people who lived centuries ago on the American continent. Little was known about them before the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. But more importantly, the Book of Mormon is another testament of Christ. It restored precious truths concerning the Fall, the Atonement, the Resurrection, and life after death.

Prior to the Restoration, the heavens had been closed for centuries. But with prophets and apostles upon the earth once more, the heavens were opened once again with visions and revelations. Many of the revelations that came to the Prophet Joseph Smith were written down in a book that came to be known as the Doctrine and Covenants. This contains further insights about principles and ordinances and is a valuable source concerning the structure of the priesthood. In addition, we have another canon of scripture called the Pearl of Great Price. It contains the book of Moses, which came by revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the book of Abraham, which he translated from a purchased Egyptian scroll. From these we learn not only a great deal more about Moses, Abraham, Enoch, and other prophets but also many more details about the Creation. We learn that the gospel of Jesus Christ was taught to all of the prophets from the beginning—even from the time of Adam.23",0

The plates are a testament to God's willingness to honor, utilize, and consecrate the spiritually motivated efforts of his children, building on and enhancing the effects of their real labor.

10. In multiple ways, the plates typologically represent Jesus Christ himself, signaling his veiled—yet ever-present—role in the translation process and that the words which Joseph Smith dictated are ultimately the words of Christ.

Thus, rather than being useless, the plates can be seen as possessing multi-faceted value. One might even conclude that their role in the Restoration narrative is nothing short of brilliant, as they accomplish diverse purposes at each stage of the Book of Mormon's coming forth and translation.

Concerning the preservation of ""all the plates which do contain that which is holy writ,"" Alma declared, ""Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise"" (Alma 37:5–6). This prophetic declaration aptly describes reactions to the plates of the Book of Mormon. To many critical observers, the story of the plates has indeed seemed foolish. Yet because of their preservation, ""many great things"" have been brought to pass which ""confound the wise.""44",1

Included in the record were prophecies of Isaiah (1 Ne. 19:22-23; cf. 5:13). All of the Isaiah texts in the Book of Mormon are quotations from that record, except perhaps those cited by the risen Jesus (cf. 1 Ne. 16, 21- 22). Whether quoting directly or paraphrasing, Book of Mormon prophets were trying to do two things: ""persuade [people] to believe in the Lord their Redeemer"" (1 Ne. 19:23) and reveal the plans of God for his people, as noted by the prophet Isaiah (e.g., 2 Ne. 25:7; Hel. 8:18-20; 3 Ne. 23:1-2). These features give a singular quality to the Isaiah texts of the Book of Mormon, because it preserves almost exclusively the texts pertaining to salvation and saving principles and ignores Isaiah's historical material. The concerns of Book of Mormon prophets were doctrinal, and passages were utilized to expound their testimonies. Moreover, the passages that concern salvation from the later chapters of Isaiah are presented to show that Jesus was the promised Messiah (cf. Mosiah 13:33-15:31, which cites Isa. 53;52:7, 8-10). While nineteenth-century biblical scholarship held that the concept of a ""saving Messiah"" arose after the Babylonian exile (587-538 B.C.) and therefore the later chapters of Isaiah are to be dated to the end of the sixth century or later, the Book of Mormon texts obviously undermine that theory.",2

It is evident that the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts provide evidence contravening modern theories of multiple authorship of Isaiah's book (see Isaiah: Authorship); for if the origins of the Isaiah material in the Book of Mormon are accepted as stated by its authors, then by 600 B.C. the book of Isaiah was essentially as it is today. The chief value of textual criticism, in this case, is to help identify special themes and language patterns, that is, to provide a better understanding of the message, not a determination of authorship. The most viable and certainly the most productive option for determining the origin of the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts is therefore an internal examination.",2

The attraction derives primarily from the extensive use of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon. Secondarily, chapter 11 of Isaiah was quoted to Joseph Smith in a vision in his earliest days as a prophet (JS-H 1:40) and became the subject of a section in the Doctrine and Covenants (D&C 113). In addition, Jesus Christ has given revelations about, and prophets and apostles of the latter days have frequently quoted from and commented upon Isaiah's words when instructing the Saints.

Traditionally, the book of Isaiah has been ascribed to a prophet living in the kingdom of Judah between 740 and 690 B.C. In Germany during the late 1700s, several scholars challenged this view, claiming that chapters 40-66 were written by one or more other individuals as late as 400 B.C. because of the specific references to events that occurred after Isaiah's death. This outlook now permeates many Bible commentaries and has led to the postulation of a second prophetic writer who is commonly called in scholarly literature ""Deutero-Isaiah."" Indeed, a wide variety of theories regarding the date and authorship of Isaiah now exist. However, LDS belief in revelation and the seership of prophets, along with the quotations from Isaiah in the Book of Mormon and its admonitions to study his writings, have reinforced Latter-day Saints in the traditional view concerning the date and authorship of Isaiah, in the following ways.

First, while some scholars argue that prophets could not see the future and that, therefore, the later chapters of Isaiah must have been written after Isaiah's time (e.g., Isa. 45 concerning Cyrus), Latter-day Saints recognize that prophets can see and prophesy about the future. In chapters 40-66, Isaiah prophesies of the future, just as the apostle John does in Revelation 4-22,and the prophet Nephi 1 in 2 Nephi 25-30.",2

When the Book of Mormon people left Jerusalem, they carried records on plates of brass that contained many Old Testament books predating 600 B.C., including Isaiah. Early in their narratives, Nephi 1 and his brother, Jacob, quoted extensively from Isaiah. Later, the resurrected Jesus admonished his hearers in the Americas to search the words of Isaiah diligently, for ""great are the words of Isaiah"" (3 Ne. 23:1).

Latter-day Saints see many of Isaiah's prophecies fulfilled in contemporary events. When the angel Moroni appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith on September 21-22, 1823, he quoted Isaiah 11 and said it was ""about to be fulfilled"" (JS-H 1:40). Isaiah 29 is also seen as a prophecy anticipating the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith's teachings contain many references to Isaiah, especially about the last days before the second coming of Christ. Additionally, Isaiah is often quoted in the Doctrine and Covenants (e.g., 45:10; 50:10-12; 64:34-35; 133), and in some cases interpretations are added (e.g., D&C 113).",3

The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants, modern LDS scriptures, confirm this assessment and contain extensive commentaries on his writings. The Book of Mormon quotes 425 verses and paraphrases many others from the book of Isaiah, taken from the plates of brass, a record brought to the Western Hemisphere by the prophet Lehi and his family (c. 600 B.C.). The Book of Mormon quotations from Isaiah are accompanied by the interpretations of Nephite prophets and the resurrected Jesus Christ. The Doctrine and Covenants likewise contains quotations and paraphrases of Isaiah, many illuminating the setting for and relevance of the fulfillment of his prophecies.

**THE BOOK OF MORMON.** The prophets in the Book of Mormon explicitly praise the writings of Isaiah and provide a thorough commentary thereon. Besides three early nephite prophets, Nephi 1, Jacob, and Abinadi, who quoted extensively from and explained the meanings of Isaiah, the resurrected Jesus Christ, when he visited the Nephites (A.D. 34), commanded his hearers to ""search these things diligently; for great are the words of Isaiah"" (3 Ne. 23:1). Most Book of Mormon citations of Isaiah concern two themes: (1) the testimony that Jesus Christ would come into the world to save it (1 Ne. 19:23; cf. 2 Ne. 9:5-12), and (2) pronouncements that even though the Lord would scatter Israel, he would gather and restore them, fulfilling the covenants that he made with Abraham and Israel (2 Ne. 6:5; cf. 9:1-2).",3

Book of Mormon prophets taught from the brass plate records, not only from chapters 1-39, which are usually assigned by scholars to the prophet Isaiah of the eighth century B.C., but also from the later chapters, the so-called Deutero-Isaiah. For example, Isaiah chapters 48-54 are all quoted in the Book of Mormon, with some passages mentioned a number of times (1 Ne. 20-21; 2 Ne. 6:16-8:25; Mosiah 12:21-24;14;15:29-31; 3 Ne. 16:18-20;20:32-45;22).

Nephi, his brother Jacob, and Isaiah had each seen the Redeemer (as the premortal Jesus Christ) face to face (2 Ne. 11:2-3; cf. 2 Ne. 16:1-7). Nephi's own vision (1 Ne. 11:13-20) clarified Isaiah's words pointing to the coming of Christ (cf. 2 Ne. 17:14;19:6-7i.e., [Isa. 7:14;9:6-7]).

Nephi's commentary on Isaiah 2-14 describes what was to happen to the Jews (2 Ne. 25:9-21; cf. Isa. 3:1-15;5:1-7), to Nephi's own people (2 Ne. 25:22-26:11; cf. Isa. 29:1-4), and among the Gentiles (2 Ne. 26:12-28:32; cf. Isa. 3:16-4:1). Nephi knew by revelation that when the Book of Mormon would come forth among Gentiles, churches would be lifted up in pride and learning, secret combinations would prevail, and priestcraft would flourish (2 Ne. 26:14-33; cf. Isa. 3:16-4:1; 2 Ne. 13:16-14:1). By contrast, he foresaw that beautiful branches of Israel would be cleansed and grow in both Zion and Jerusalem and that they would be protected by the Lord (Isa. 4:2-6; 2 Ne. 14:2-6). Expanding Isaiah's prophecy, Nephi prophesied that Gentiles who repented would be numbered with the house of Israel and become heirs of the promised blessings (2 Ne. 30:1-3). He affirmed that his own people would again receive the gospel of Jesus Christ and become a pure and delightsome people (2 Ne. 30:4-6). He foretold the gathering of Jews to Jerusalem, as they would begin to believe in Christ, and also as a delightsome people (2 Ne. 30:7).",2

Initially, some Church leaders encourage first-time readers to move through these chapters, understanding what is accessible and saving the rest for later study. In Isaiah's writings, Latter-day Saints find an important testimony of Christ and of the fulfillment of God's covenants with the house of Israel. Christ admonished his followers to ""search these things diligently, for great are the words of Isaiah"" (3 Ne. 23:11).

Another possible hurdle for readers is the book's nonchronological insertions. Nephi and Jacob and Jacob's descendants wrote first-person accounts from about 590 B.C. until about 150 B.C., and then Mormon (about A.D. 385) inserted a shorter chapter to explain his role as abridger of another record. Then the reader is returned via Mormon's abridgment to the history of Nephi's successors and of the descendants of Alma 1. As groups of people break away from and return to the main body, parts of their records are incorporated into the book, causing the reader to jump back to earlier events. Likewise, Moroni's abridgment of the very ancient book of Ether appears out of chronological order near the end. In addition, the Book of Mormon, like the Old Testament, describes events from widely separated intervals. As an abridgment, it contains only a small part of the proceedings of these ancient peoples.",3

The gospel will be taught to Jews in their scattered locations and, after they accept it, they will return to Jerusalem and teach their own people (3 Ne. 20:29-35; cf. Isa. 52:8-10). Jesus gave his hearers a sign that the restoration of Jews to Jerusalem would indicate that the restoration had already begun among other Israelites in Zion, the Americas (3 Ne. 21:1-7; Isa. 52:1-3, 6-7, 11-12). In a reference to the ""marred"" servant of Isaiah 52:13-15,he spoke of the servant's ""marvelous work."" While the marred servant was clearly the mortal Jesus (Mosiah 15:1-9), Isaiah's words form a dual prophecy because the resurrected Jesus said that it also referred to a latter-day servant. Latter-day Saints believe that this servant was the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the marvelous work referred to was the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the restoration of the gospel (3 Ne. 21:8-11).

While expanding on Isaiah's words, Jesus foretold the building of the New Jerusalem in the Western Hemisphere by a remnant of the house of Israel, assisted by converted Gentiles (3 Ne. 21:22-25; cf. 20:22).

The numerous relationships between the two books also show us how the Nephites incorporated some of the timeless truths of Deuteronomy into their lives, teaching us how we can do the same.

For example, Deuteronomy tells us that good leaders should care more about knowing and keeping the commandments than they do about money or possessions (see Deuteronomy 17:14–20). King Benjamin clearly took this counsel to heart (see Mosiah 2:10–13). His life is an example of how we can apply Deuteronomy to ourselves and become better leaders. Another example is in Deuteronomy 31:9–13, which tells people that they should make the scriptures a focal point of their lives. Alma 5 gives practical ways in which people can make this ideal a reality in daily life.

Another doctrine, found in Deuteronomy 6:7–9, states that parents should teach the commandments ""diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up."" Alma 36–42 is an example of how Alma obeyed this commandment and shows us how we can fulfill this commandment today as well.

When we understand how the Nephites lived the commandments contained in Deuteronomy and applied its teachings to their own lives, we can have a better idea of how we can apply Deuteronomy to ourselves as well, allowing it to become an important source of insight into how we can live better lives today.",3

They are the only extant Isaiah texts that have no ""original"" language source with which the translation can be textually compared. These English texts date to the translation and initial publication of the Book of Mormon (1829).

These Isaiah texts were quoted and paraphrased by many Book of Mormon prophets who had a copy of Isaiah on the plates of brass. Attempts to determine the authenticity of those Book of Mormon Isaiah texts by comparing them with Hebrew, Greek, and Latin texts of Isaiah hold interest, but such efforts are moot because the ancient texts behind the Book of Mormon Isaiah translation are not available for study. However, much can be learned by comparing the numerous ancient versions and translations of Isaiah with the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts. Such comparisons result in granting the Book of Mormon Isaiah full recensional status.

The Isaiah materials in the Book of Mormon exhibit many similarities to those in the King James translation of the Bible, which would seem to indicate that both share a Hebrew Masoretic origin. However, many other peculiarities in the Book of Mormon texts point to an origin related to texts similar to those from which the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate were derived. These peculiar readings are significant enough that they preclude relegating the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts to being a mere copy of the King James Version. The Isaiah texts found in English translation in the Book of Mormon possess a distinctive character that indicates a unique textual origin. The important question is not, ""Are the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts authentic?"" Rather, the issue is, ""Do the Book of Mormon Isaiah texts provide clear evidence of variant texts besides those normally acknowledged?"" Should they not be considered as valid as, say, the Dead Sea Isaiah texts?",3

But ""when the king had heard the words of the book of the law … he rent his clothes"" in grief, knowing that he and his people had not kept the laws in this book (vv. 11–13).

That's right. If you understand the Bible, you will better understand the Book of Mormon. And if you understand the Book of Mormon, you can use that to unlock greater, deeper insights and meaning in the Bible. And it's an iterative process. It just keeps feeding and growing over time as you keep immersing in both. So look at verse 4. Shon's already alluded to this.

So there are ways to see how the Book of Mormon, these plates being buried in Hill Cumorah, could literally fulfill this, but Isaiah, his seership writing is so big and so broad that it can be applied in myriad ways.

For us, as Latter-day Saints, we love this Book of Mormon application to that prophecy, that those scriptures were laid low, and now they're speaking out of the ground, out of the dust.

Now I like to study the prophecies of Isaiah, and to my way of thinking he almost lived more in our day than when he was actually here upon the earth; he saw so much of what would transpire in this dispensation. Now for instance, this prophecy of Isaiah has always appealed to me. When Babylon was the greatest city in all the world, Isaiah prophesied that Babylon would be destroyed, that it would become the abode of reptiles and wild animals, that the Arabs would no more pitch their tents there. Then he said that Babylon would never be rebuilt. (See Isa. 13.) Now can you imagine anyone today declaring that one of our great cities would be destroyed and never be rebuilt? And yet, Babylon has never yet to this day been rebuilt.

Now I would like to discuss with you today a little about the twenty-ninth chapter of Isaiah.

### **Comments**

A new chapter begins at this point in the Book of Mormon insertion of Isaiah chapters, and it corresponds to the second major section of Isaiah. The previous unit very clearly dealt with Assyria, which was the current threat during Isaiah's lifetime. This chapter begins by discussing Babylon, which should be an anachronism.

The Book of Mormon has already cited passages from what scholars call Deutero-Isaiah, and second Isaiah. It is posited as a different writer, whose writings were ascribed to Isaiah. Although there are other reasons for that assignation, one of the reasons is that the text refers so clearly to the Babylonian captivity, which is a hundred years in Isaiah's future.

It is possible to suggest that prophetic knowledge is sufficient to see what will happen and identify correctly the nations by name, but this reference to Babylon occurs in a section that is attributed to Isaiah himself. How is it that this first Isaiah might refer to Babylon if the reference to Babylon is one of the reasons that Deutero-Isaiah is suggested as being a different writer?

A non-Latter-day Saint scholar suggests that we are seeing some later editorial changes in Isaiah's text, changes which update information that pertained to the Assyrian invasion to the later Babylonian invasion which paralleled the Assyrian invasion in many ways. With the understanding that there are times when we can see a later editorial hand making some changes in the uncontested Isaiah, perhaps that lays a foundation for understanding a later editorial hand, perhaps even a heavy editorial hand, in the Deutero-Isaiah chapters.

That would allow the texts cited in the Book of Mormon to have been part of Isaiah, but simply preserved in the forms and contexts of the later editorial hand.",3

And for those of you who recognize the heading here, it says compare 2 Nephi 27. This is the Isaiah chapter in the Book of Mormon that has more edits, more adaptations than any of the included Isaiah chapters in the Book of Mormon. And that brings up the question, is it Nephi who's redacting or do the brass plates show up exactly the way they appear in our book Mormon? And later on, what the Masoretic texts and the Dead Sea scrolls and the other ancient parts of the Old Testament we have in the Hebrew? Did they get modified after Nephi had left? Great questions.

So just a quick thought about this, whether 2 Nephi 27 restores Isaiah's original language or whether it's a Nephite prophetic likening or adaptation that Nephi has authority to do. Now, I actually have an opinion, and that is that this is an example of Nephi adding, focusing us in closely on his sacred text, which is the Book of Mormon, right, the one that he's created. But others I don't want to distract because others might disagree with that and we don't know the answer at the end of the day. What I do think can be helpful is to broaden our understanding of this beyond the Book of Mormon and view sealed words of sealed texts, not just as the Book of Mormon has a sealed portion and it goes in the ground and then it comes forth in the last days which is true and powerful, but to see how that happens
with biblical teachings as well. And biblical prophets also become voices that speak from the dust of the earth, right? Isaiah certainly does.",3

They were probably hard for people in Isaiah's day to understand, and they are even harder to grasp today. But the Book of Mormon encourages and enables modern readers to find great value in Isaiah's important prophecies. The sheer volume of Isaiah chapters in the small plates of Nephi tells us that Lehi, Nephi, and Jacob saw Isaiah (who died only about twenty years before Lehi was born) as the guiding star of Israelite prophets in their day.

Ancient scribes were, for the most part, extremely conscientious. Although changes could occur from one copy to another, it is impressive to see how close the Isaiah texts in Dead Sea Scrolls still conform to the Masoretic Hebrew over a thousand years later.

For Latter-day Saints, when Ezekiel spoke of ""sticks"" (probably waxed writing boards), he was illustrating the instruments by which God would bring peoples together in the latter days, just as he used the concept of the Resurrection to illustrate the gathering of God's people, which is the theme of chapters 34-37. Just as bodies are reconstituted in the Resurrection, so will Israel be reconstituted in the gathering; and the formerly divided nations will become one (Ezek. 37:1-14). Thus, the publication of the Book of Mormon in 1830 was a sign that the divided tribes of Israel were to become one under God and that God's latter-day work was beginning to be implemented (Ezek. 37:21-28; cf. 1 Ne. 13:34-41; 3 Ne. 20:46-21:11).",2

According to this theory, Sidney Rigdon secretly gave Joseph Smith a copy of an unpublished manuscript written by a certain Solomon Spalding (or Spaulding).

—because it's been so thoroughly disproved. But here's just, in a nutshell, some of the problems. The Manuscript Found, Solomon Spalding's work, is 50,840 words. That means it is less than a fifth of the actual length of the Book of Mormon. You've still got to come up with four-fifths of the Book of Mormon, even if you're saying he plagiarized from this. The writing style and the composition of the two books are really, really different. For instance, the Book of Mormon follows this kind of King James language. The Spaulding manuscript does not. The Spalding manuscript and the Book of Mormon don't have similarities in their storyline. The Spalding manuscript is about a Roman galleon that gets blown off course and lands in the Americas. The Book of Mormon is totally, totally different from that. And honestly, most people, when they have the chance to look at the Spaulding Manuscript and look at the Book of Mormon back off. For instance, Gerald and Sandra Tanner, who have been, like, the top opponents of the Book of Mormon for a long time and written a lot of critical stuff about Joseph Smith, said, ""We do have the original Spaulding manuscript and the Book of Mormon, which do not appear to have enough in common to insist that the latter came from the former.""",2

Rigdon's authorship is often connected to the so-called ""Spaulding theory,"" hypothesizing that a manuscript written by Solomon Spaulding was used as the basis for the Book of Mormon, with additions/edits from Rigdon or another author.

As Rigdon learned of the accusation that he wrote the Book of Mormon, he immediately sought to set the record straight. On one occasion, in front a large gathering of people, he declared:

> I testify in the presence of this congregation, and before God and all his Holy Angels up yonder, (pointing toward heaven), before whom I expect to give account at the judgment day, that I never saw a sentence of the Book of Mormon, I never penned a sentence of the Book of Mormon, I never knew that there was such a book in existence as the Book of Mormon, until it was presented to me by Parley P.

No wonder the Book of Mormon proclaims with boldness, ""And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ"" (2 Nephi 33:10).

Spaulding was born in Ashford, Connecticut, on February 21, 1761. He served in the American Revolution, later graduated from Dartmouth College, and became a clergyman.

Various claims or arguments have been advanced to support or discount these competing positions.

Disputes about the book's authorship arose as soon as its existence became public knowledge. The first general reaction was ridicule. Modern minds do not easily accept the idea that an angel can deliver ancient records to be translated by an untrained young man. Moreover, most Christians in 1830 viewed the canon of scripture as complete with the Bible; hence, the possibility of additional scripture violated a basic assumption of their faith. Opponents of Joseph Smith, such as Alexander Campbell, also argued that the Book of Mormon was heavily plagiarized from the Bible and that it reflected themes and phraseology current in New York in the 1820s. Many critics have speculated that Sidney Rigdon or Solomon Spaulding played a role in writing the book (see Spaulding Manuscript). It has also been suggested that Joseph Smith borrowed ideas from another book (see View of the Hebrews). Though these varieties of objections and theories are still defended in many quarters, they are not supported by modern authorship studies and continue to raise as many questions as they try to answer (e.g., *CWHN* 8:54-206).",3

For any not familiar with the Spaulding Theory, I turn again to my father's Leap of Faith book, with words again taken from his digital manuscript:

Sometime prior to 1829, a former Presbyterian Minister named Solomon Spaulding was known to have written a novel called ""The Manuscript Found,"" in which a fictional Indian describes events that took place in America before Columbus.

Those holding to this view see the book as reflecting no inspiration and having no historical value, although they may see some religious value in it as a statement of Joseph Smith's religious feelings. The assumption underlying this view may be either a doctrinaire rejection of divine intervention in human affairs or a specific rejection of Joseph Smith's claims to experience with the divine. Those maintaining this position may accept either the Spaulding theory or, more commonly, various environmentalist explanations for the contents of the book (see View of the Hebrews). One environmentalist explanation that has attracted some interest in the recent past among both believers and nonbelievers is based on the purported ""magic worldview"" that suffused the environment in which Joseph Smith grew up. However, this position has been heavily criticized and has not been widely received.

Another view of the Book of Mormon accepts its inspiration but rejects its historical authenticity, seeing it as in some sense inspired but not the product of antiquity, coming rather from the pen of Joseph Smith.

A third position accepts parts of the Book of Mormon as ancient, but views other parts of the book as inspired expansions on the text. This view has suffered because a concession that any part of the book is authentically ancient (and beyond the powers of Joseph Smith to have established through research) seems an admission that the Book of Mormon is what it claims to be and what has traditionally been claimed for it: that it is ancient.",1

Number four is that Joseph Smith went into some kind of trance state and wrote in what we call automatic writing, and then interestingly, a lot of opponents of the Book of Mormon have circled back to saying, ""Well, Joseph Smith was a genius.

Apparently there's a reverend named Solomon Spaulding who writes some kind of book about an early American civilization that's linked to the Book of Mormon.

Joseph claimed that the Book of Mormon was written on golden plates. This claim received unrelenting criticism in his day—for ""everyone"" knew that ancient histories were written on papyrus or parchment, until years later, when metal plates with ancient writings were discovered. In addition, the critics claimed that the use of cement, as described in the Book of Mormon, was beyond the technical expertise of these early Americans—until cement structures were found in ancient America. How do the critics now account for these and similar unlikely discoveries? Joseph, you see, must also have been a very, very lucky guesser.

When we accept the ancient roots of the book and believe that Joseph Smith did have ancient records that could not be in English, we then may ask how he translated them. The only reasonable answer is the way he said: by divine revelation.

What would be more perilous to us, eternally, than to say the Book of Mormon is holy scripture if it were not? Those who have questions or concerns about the Church may cling in security to this firm anchor that is immutable and tangible evidence of the truthfulness of the Church.

The Book of Mormon prophet Nephi wrote: ""For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do"" (2 Ne. 25:23).",0

(D&C 17:6.)

Joseph Smith once made the statement that the Book of Mormon was the keystone of this religion, that a person could get closer to God by following its precepts than by any other book. Joseph Smith has long since passed away.

I told them they should read the Book of Mormon, ponder its great and eternal truths, and pray to the Father in the name of Christ, in faith, and he would reveal the truth of the book to them by the power of the Holy Ghost.

As every gospel scholar knows, the Book of Mormon proves that Joseph Smith was called of God to minister in the prophetic office and to restore the truths of salvation in plainness and perfection.

The Book of Mormon is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible. It contains a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. It is another testament of Jesus Christ.

It contains the fulness of the gospel, meaning that it is a record of the Lord's dealings with a people who had the fulness of the gospel, and meaning also that in it is found a summary and a recitation of what all men must believe and do to gain an inheritance in the heavenly kingdom reserved for the Saints.",0

All of this I explained to my two Protestant friends. One of them, a congenial and decent sort of fellow, said somewhat casually that he would read the Book of Mormon. The other minister, manifesting a bitter spirit, said: ""I won't read it. We have experts who have read the Book of Mormon, and I have read what our experts have to say about it.""

Rigdon first met Joseph Smith in December 1830 after the Book of Mormon was published.

Nevertheless, some have continued to promote the Spaulding theory (e.g., see Holley).

This new theory posits that ""Joseph [Smith] most likely grew up reading a school book called *The Late War* by Gilbert J. Hunt and it heavily influenced his writing of The Book of Mormon.""23 Published in 1816, The Late War Between the United States and Great Britain gave an account of the War of 1812 that was intended to be an educational textbook for schoolchildren. To support the idea that Joseph Smith drew from this book in fabricating the Book of Mormon, some authors have pointed to ""similarities"" and parallels between the two books, including ""over 100 rare phrases that bind The Book of Mormon to The Late War.""24

While this theory has become popular in some online circles, it suffers from many problems. Most glaring is the fact that, as demonstrated by recent statistical analysis, the ""similarities"" and linguistic parallels between the Book of Mormon and *The Late War* are easily explainable as shared imitation of the language of the King James Bible, and not direct literary dependence.25 Beyond this, others have pointed out that many of the parallels typically listed between the two books are illusory or otherwise rather weak.26",2

It ponders the meaning of writing and reading. It describes religious experience.""27: 354–355."")

These problems with the Late War Theory indicate that in all likelihood, rather than the Book of Mormon flagrantly plagiarizing Hunt's work, the two books emerged alongside others in a shared early American literary culture.28, 2.

As he then explains, ""Removing this text wouldn't impact the weight much (it only reduces it by a little more than a half of one percent) because of the frequency in other texts. **But it does dramatically reduce the number of parallels presented**.""

The weight is how common it is. The higher the weight, the rarer it is. So, the weight was already pretty low due to how common those statements were in other similar publications. When they were removed from the equation, the weight barely changed, but the number of parallels the Johnsons claimed between the two books was ""dramatically reduced.""

He then explains, ""The Book of Mormon contains 202,830 unique four-word locutions compared with *The Late War* containing 51,221. … Why is this interesting to us? If we follow the weighted matches used by the blog, there are 549 shared four word locutions common to both texts. **This means that of all the possible phrases found in *The Late War*, only 1.07% of them make it into the Book of Mormon. And within the Book of Mormon, of the potential 200,000+ unique phrases, only 0.27% could be derived from *The Late War*.** This is not a high number. **This ratio drops substantially when we back out the 75 parallels taken from the copyright application (with 474 parallels it becomes 0.93% and 0.23% respectively)**.

The article is technical with a lot of jargon to wade through, but the core of it is well worth reading if you can make it through the entire thing. McGuire not only debunks the Johnsons' claims about the Book of Mormon, but also the ones they made about Jane Austen having less contemporary influence on her work than Joseph Smith did on his.",0

By the way, the full name is The Late War between the United States and Great Britain is the full name.

No one can ever estimate the terrible suffering incident to that conflict. Lives numbered in the tens of thousands have been lost. The terrible wounds of war have left bodies maimed and minds destroyed. Families have been left without fathers. Young boys who have been recruited as soldiers have, in many instances, died while those yet alive have had woven into the very fabric of their natures elements of hatred which will never leave them. The treasure of the involved nations has been wasted and will never be recovered.

To us who look upon it from afar it seems so unnecessary and such a terrible waste of human life and national resources. Seven years is a long time. ""Will it ever end?"" we ask.

But there is another war that has gone on since before the world was created and which is likely to continue for a long time yet to come. John the Revelator speaks of that struggle:

""And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,

""And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.

""And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him"" (Rev. 12:7–9).

That war, so bitter, so intense, has gone on, and it has never ceased. It is the war between truth and error, between agency and compulsion, between the followers of Christ and those who have denied Him. His enemies have used every stratagem in that conflict. They've indulged in lying and deceit. They've employed money and wealth. They've tricked the minds of men. They've murdered and destroyed and engaged in every other unholy and impure practice to thwart the work of Christ.

It began in the earth when Cain slew Abel. The Old Testament is replete with accounts of the same eternal struggle.",2

As long as the early Christians had no responsibility for government, they were obliged only ""to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work"" (Titus 3:1), to render unto Caesar ""the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's"" (Matt. 22:21). Paul saw the real battle as being one with evil spiritual forces (Eph. 6:12). Once it became clear in early Christianity that the second coming of Jesus was not at hand and that the Roman Empire had become Christian, responsibility for political order became a Christian duty. There then developed a theory of war culminating in the doctrine of ""just war"" formulated by theologians such as Thomas Aquinas.",1

The gospel of Jesus Christ calls upon disciples to ""do good; seek peace"" (Psalm 34:14) and ""live peaceably with all men"" (Romans 12:18). In His Sermon on the Mount, the Savior said, ""Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God"" (Matthew 5:9). He then taught His disciples to reconcile with adversaries (vv. 21–26), turn the other cheek (v. 39), and ultimately, ""love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you"" (v. 44).

In response to the first wave of persecution and mob violence directed against the Saints in 1833, Joseph Smith received a revelation instructing the Saints to ""renounce war and proclaim peace"" (Doctrine and Covenants 98:16) and to endure persecution patiently and seek to resolve conflicts peacefully before taking up arms in self-defense (D&C 98:23–37). On multiple occasions when local Church leaders from Parowan and Cedar City counseled together regarding the emigrant company at the Mountain Meadows, they encouraged actions that would prevent or deescalate the violence and promote peace. It was only by repeatedly ignoring the judicious and sound decisions of these councils that the massacre was brought about.

Speaking on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of this tragic event, President Henry B. Eyring said:

> The gospel of Jesus Christ that we espouse abhors the cold-blooded killing of men, women, and children. Indeed, it advocates peace and forgiveness. What was done here long ago by members of our Church represents a terrible and inexcusable departure from Christian teaching and conduct. We cannot change what happened, but we can remember and honor those who were killed here.28

Recent years alone have witnessed riots, mass shootings, and war. Such violence is endemic to the human condition. Too often, regular people get swept up in the heat of a moment, and a specific set of conditions leads typically good people to commit unspeakable acts of violence. Regrettably, Latter-day Saints have not been immune to this common human problem.

Violence was an especially prevalent reality on the American frontier in the nineteenth century, where it was often directed toward minority groups, including religious minorities, who were unfairly perceived as the source of various social ills.2 As such, Latter-day Saints were regularly victims of violence in the 1830s and '40s.3, 6–19."") Incidents like the Hawn's Mill Massacre, which was set amid the violent expulsion of Latter-day Saints from Missouri,4."") and the later martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith followed by another violent expulsion—this time from Illinois—had a generational impact upon the Latter-day Saints who endured these injustices and lost loved ones either in the violence or its aftermath.5."")

At times, after repeated acts of violence against them, the Saints responded with violence of their own, which they saw as acts of self-defense. As one trio of historians noted, however, ""The majority could take the law into its own hands with impunity, but when minorities employed the same approach or tried to fight back, it usually backfired.""6 Such acts of aggression tended to confirm the stereotypes about how violent and depraved the ""Mormons"" were and thus escalated the hostilities directed toward them.

It is well documented that Brigham Young's command was to let the travelers pass through in peace, but his advice arrived too late to prevent the killing, and a locally orchestrated cover-up portrayed the crime as solely an Indian depredation. Responding to charges that whites were involved, President Young urged the new governor to investigate, but Governor Cumming maintained that if whites were involved they would be pardoned under the general amnesty granted in 1858. Eventually, as more information came to light, some of the principal participants were excommunicated from the Church and one, John D. Lee, was convicted in federal court and executed.

Though preoccupied by the Civil War, the federal government nonetheless demonstrated interest in Utah Territory. In 1862 Fort Douglas was established on the eastern edge of Salt Lake City, under the leadership of a dedicated anti-Mormon, Patrick Edward Connor. Connor and his troops were charged with guarding transportation routes, but they also published the aggressively anti-Mormon *Union Vedette*, encouraged mining, and promoted non-Mormon immigration to the territory. In 1863 Connor's troops attacked a group of Northern Shoshone Indians on the Bear River in the northern Cache Valley, killing some 250 men, women, and children.",3

These officials would then go back to Washington and spread rumors about the Saints, which stirred up further animosity.8 On July 24, 1857, word reached Utah of an approaching army sent by the US government.9."") The intentions of this military force were initially unclear, but given the Saints' past experience with violent persecution, many assumed the worst. The Saints began to prepare for war. Brigham Young and other leaders throughout Utah gave wartime speeches, rallying the Saints to defend themselves and encouraging them to store up any surplus grain, guns, and ammunition.10

Summer was also a time when many people emigrated, and by some reports an especially high volume of emigrants poured into California in 1857. Many wagon trains heading to California would pass through Utah, hoping to restock and resupply on food, ammunition, and other necessities in Salt Lake City and other towns along the trail. Although these wagon trains were generally good for the Utah economy, squabbles between the emigrants passing through and the settled population, including Native Americans, were not uncommon. The heightened tensions in Utah due to the wartime atmosphere served to magnify these petty conflicts in the minds of some of the Saints.11",3

John D. Lee was recruited to persuade the Paiutes, who only agreed to do it if Lee led them.18 When Haight convened a council meeting in Cedar City to try to obtain approval for the attack, he was opposed by other local leaders, who forced him to agree to send a messenger to Brigham Young asking how to proceed.19 Before a messenger could be sent, however, an ambush was launched on the emigrants by Lee and some Paiutes. The wagon company circled their wagons in a defensive position and settled in for what became a five-day siege.20

A messenger was still sent to Brigham Young, but before he could return events began to spiral out of control. The emigrants became aware that it was not merely an attack by natives, but that Mormons were involved. Fearing the consequences if word got out that the Mormons had attacked a wagon train, Haight and others determined that they could not allow survivors to escape, but Haight felt he needed permission from William Dame to execute his deadly plan.21

Once again, a council was called in Parowan with Dame and other leaders. But these men did not approve an attack on the emigrants, and instead a plan was made to help the company continue on its way to California.22 Haight believed this was unacceptable. He and one of his counselors privately met with Dame and pressed upon him his fear that letting the emigrants survive to tell of the attack ""would unleash aggression on the southern Mormon settlements.""23 Reports on exactly what was said and agreed to in this meeting are conflicting and uncertain, but Haight came away believing that he had Dame's support for his subsequent actions.24",2

Besides a few persons who left the party before the attack, only about eighteen small children were spared. Two years later, seventeen of the children were returned to family members in northwestern Arkansas. Two decades after the tragedy, one of the Mormon settlers who were present at the massacre, John D. Lee, was executed by a firing squad at the Mountain Meadows, symbolically carrying to the grave the responsibility for those who ""were led to do what none singly would have done under normal conditions, and for which none singly can be held responsible"" (Brooks, p. 218).

Yet for more than another century after Lee's death, the community guilt of those who participated in the massacre continued to fester alongside the collective pain of both the children who survived it and the relatives of those who did not. Then in the late 1980s, the descendants of those affected by the tragedy began meeting to bind the wounds and achieve a reconciliation. On September 15, 1990, many of them gathered to dedicate a memorial marker to those who died at the Mountain Meadows.

One speaker at the marker dedication was Judge Roger V. Logan, Jr., of Harrison, Arkansas, a man related to twenty-one of the massacre victims listed on the marker, as well as to five of the children who survived.

Brigham and the other leaders learned of the massacre, but didn't learn of the extent of the involvement of the Saints until much later. That coverup and the intention to blame it entirely on the Paiutes was in full swing. But in 1859, two years later, everyone who was involved in the planning of the attack was released from their callings, and in 1870, as more information came to light, Haight and Lee were excommunicated. Many of the militia men involved believed they were acting on Brigham's orders, as that's what they'd been told, so they were treated more lightly for their roles. Nine indictments were handed down, with many of them being arrested, but only Lee was tried and executed for his crimes.

When he was killed, Lee's demeanor and quotes, as well as his book, led many to believe this execution was an example of Blood Atonement, and again, the stories took off.

There was a movie made about it in 2007 starring Jon Voight as Brigham Young called *September Dawn*, painting Young as the instigator and chief conspirator of the entire thing.

Much like the Nephites in 3 Nephi 11, *we need Jesus Christ*. Can you imagine yourself there, among people who had experienced so much chaos and destruction?

""Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may *thrust* your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may *know* that I am … the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.

""And … the multitude went forth … one by one … and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know … *and had witnessed for themselves*.""1

These Nephites eagerly went forward to thrust their hands into His side and feel the prints of the nails in His hands and feet so they could witness for themselves that this was the Christ. Similarly, many faithful people we have studied in the New Testament this year had anxiously awaited Christ's coming. Then they stepped from their fields, workbenches, and dinner tables and followed Him, pressed upon Him, thronged Him, and sat with Him. Are we as anxious to witness for ourselves as the multitudes in the scriptures? Are the blessings we seek less needful than theirs?

When Christ physically visited the Nephites at their temple, His invitation was not to stand at a distance and look upon Him, but to touch Him, to feel for themselves the reality of the Savior of humankind.

I testify that amidst the wondrously complex tasks inherent in the universe, He seeks our individual happiness and safety above all other godly concerns. We are created in His very image and likeness,16 and Jesus of Nazareth, His Only Begotten Son in the flesh, came to earth as the perfect mortal manifestation of His grandeur. In addition to the witness of the ancients we also have the modern miracle of Palmyra, the appearance of God the Father and His Beloved Son, the Savior of the world, to the boy prophet Joseph Smith. I testify of that appearance, and in the words of that prophet I, too, declare: ""Our heavenly Father is more liberal in His views, and boundless in His mercies and blessings, than we are ready to believe or receive. … God does not look on sin with [the least degree of] allowance, but … the nearer we get to our heavenly Father, the more we are disposed to look with compassion on perishing souls; we feel that we want to take them upon our shoulders, and cast their sins behind our backs.""17

I bear witness of a God who has such shoulders. And in the spirit of the holy apostleship, I say as did one who held this office anciently: ""Herein [then] is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another""18—and to love Him forever, I pray. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.",0

""And behold, I am the light and the life of the world."" (3 Ne. 11:10–11.)

The whole multitude fell to the earth, and while they were in this attitude of reverence and humility, the Savior blessed them and taught them. His very first act was to commission Nephi to baptize, saying, ""I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven."" (3 Ne. 11:21.)

He also called others, twelve in number, and gave them this power, establishing that it is necessary to have authority to act in the name of the Lord. He gave them the words they should use and instructed them to baptize by immersion as they performed the ordinance of baptism. This is the same form of baptism practiced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He made it clear to them that there should be no disputations among them as to points of doctrine which he would expound, which he said was the doctrine his Father had given unto him. He commanded the twelve to go forth and declare his words unto the ends of the earth.",1

The name Jesus, like Joshua, derives from the Hebrew root *yasha'*, meaning ""to deliver, rescue, or save""; and *christos* is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew *mashiyach*, meaning ""anointed"" or ""Messiah"" (see Jesus Christ, Names and Titles of). Thus, the Nephites used the intimate yet freely spoken name of the mortal Jesus as their name for God, while the ineffable YHWH (see Jehovah, Jesus Christ) appears only twice in the book (2 Ne. 22:2; Moro. 10:34).

Some, such as Sherem, whose cultural roots lay in the monotheistic world of Jerusalem, resisted the worship of the Messiah, alleging that this violated the Law of Moses (Ex. 20:3; Jacob 7:7; see Antichrists). Nephi had previously declared that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost were ""one God"" (2 Ne. 31:21), but Nephite challengers continued to attack the proposition that Jesus was God, to deny that his Atonement could be efficacious in advance of its occurrence, and to argue that there could not be many Gods who were still one God (e.g., Mosiah 17:8; Alma 11:28).

He remembered and wrote it down, but then chose not to use it again until he was nearly finished with his record, after quoting extensively from Isaiah. Then, after reintroducing the name and reminding readers that an angel had revealed it, Nephi went on to use both *Jesus* and *Christ* together 5 more times, and the name *Jesus* alone appears another 3 times.18; 30:5 (2x). For only Jesus, see 2 Nephi 31:10; 33:4, 6."")

Perhaps Nephi chose to begin using the name during his commentary on Isaiah because, in Hebrew, ""The names 'Jesus' and 'Isaiah' are similar in form and meaning.""19, 490. Yesha'yahu (Isaiah) is composed of yesha, which means ""help, deliverance, salvation,"" and then the theophoric yahu, meaning Yahweh. Yeshua (Jesus) is another form of the name Yehoshua (Joshua) and likewise derives from yasha. See Ludwig Koehler and Walter Baumgartner, The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament, trans. M.E.J. Richardson, 2 vols. (Leiden: Brill, 2001), 1:446, 449. See also ""Isaiah,"" ""Jesus,"" and ""Joshua,"" in Book of Mormon Onomasticon, ed. Paul Y. Hoskisson, online at onoma.lib.byu.edu."") Both names are based on the root word *yasha*, meaning *salvation*. It thus may not be a coincidence that right after Nephi reminded readers of the angelically revealed name *Jesus Christ*, Nephi taught the most central doctrine of the Gospel: ""there is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be *saved*"" (2 Nephi 25:30).",1

Like the carefully chosen names of Nephi and Lehi, can it be said and written of us that we are true disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ? Do we honor the name of Jesus Christ that we have willingly taken upon ourselves? Are we both ""a minister and a witness""18 of His loving-kindness and His redeeming power?

Not long ago, I was listening to the Book of Mormon. In the last chapter of 2 Nephi, I *heard* Nephi say something that I had never *read* the same way before. All throughout his record, he teaches and testifies of the ""Redeemer,"" the ""Holy One of Israel,"" the ""Lamb of God,"" and the ""Messiah."" But as he closed his account, I heard him say these words: ""I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in *my Jesus,* for he hath redeemed my soul.""19 When I heard these words, my heart rejoiced and I had to listen over and over again. I recognized and responded to that verse just as I recognize and respond to my own name.

The Lord has said, ""Yea, blessed is this people who are willing to bear my name; for in my name shall they be called; and they are mine.""20

As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, may we ""gladly [take upon us] the name of Christ""21 by honoring His name with love, devotion, and good works.

The earlier writers tend to connect the Lord more with Israel than do the later authors.

5. The earlier Book of Mormon writers use greater variety in their names for Christ than do the later writers. In the early texts, more forms of expression were used and greater variety exists in their formulations. Of the sixty-seven names researched in this study, Lehi used fifteen, Nephi used thirty-two, and Jacob, nineteen. Nephite religious speech was evidently more varied in the earlier generations when the revelations were new. As Nephite religious practices and culture became more established, standardized forms and conventions of discourse evidently prevailed.

1. These testimonies are true to life. They are corroborated by the credentials of authentic personal experience and complex individual diversity. They make sense historically, and they emerge distinctly even from widely scattered primary sources within individual authors.

2. The testimonies become linguistically more definite as time progresses. Lehi at first spoke of Jesus being ""*a*Messiah,"" ""*a*prophet,"" ""*a* Savior"" (1 Nephi 10:4; emphasis added) or ""*this*Redeemer"" (1 Nephi 10:5; emphasis added), but this designation soon crystallized in Nephi's abridgment as ""*the*Messiah"" (1 Nephi 10:7, 9–10; emphasis added). It is also evident that Lehi was not explicit at first about the meaning of the ""redemption"" of this Messiah. Was it to be a spiritual redemption in the next life, or a physical redemption of the land now or later? This question was raised at least twice by Laman and Lemuel (see 1 Nephi 15:31; 22:1) and finally answered by Nephi: it would be both (see 1 Nephi 22:3).

3. The record often indicates when and how important details about Christ were revealed. The name of ""Christ,"" for example, was told to Jacob by an angel; the name of ""Jesus Christ"" was revealed to Nephi; the extended name, ""Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning,"" was first given to the people by King Benjamin to distinguish them above all people led by the Lord. Nephite knowledge of Christ, like all other facets of revealed knowledge, grew ""line upon line"" (2 Nephi 28:30).",2

The name Jehovah vocalized thus is not found in ancient texts, but is a modern convention. In ancient times, the Hebrew text had no vowels; thus the consonants in God's name were *yhwh*. Jews avoided pronouncing these consonants when reading aloud, substituting **adonai*, a word meaning ""the Lord."" Following this practice, King James translators usually rendered* yhwh *as ""the Lord."" In medieval Hebrew texts, the vowels from*** *adonai* were added to the consonants *yhwh* to remind Jewish readers to say ""'*adonai*.""

Latter-day Saints accept Jehovah as a name for the premortal Christ because this is the common English form for *yhwh*.

**EL.** **El *is not a name, but is the common noun for God in Hebrew (plural,*** *elohim* ). Latter-day Saints often use Elohim for the Father, allowing a distinction between members of the Godhead.

He asked, ""Have they [the people] not read the scriptures, which say ye must take upon you the name of Christ, which is my name?"" (3 Nephi 27:5). The instruction to take upon oneself the name of Christ is found in several previous Nephite scriptures, including 2 Nephi 31:13; Mosiah 5:8, 10; Mosiah 25:23; Alma 34:38; and Alma 46:18.",2

Jesus established this church among us but we don't have a name for it so they're praying when all of a sudden the Lord appears – he came and stood (in verse 2) in the midst of them, and he says ""What will ye that I shall give unto you?"" By the way, just as a side note here, isn't it interesting how often God asks questions of people the answer to which God already knows. But there's something beautiful about him getting people to act, use their agency and to ask before he just comes and gives them things that he already knows better than they do what they need. So here it is again, he's asking them this question and their answer is well we want to know the name whereby we shall call thy church because there are disputations among the people concerning the matter. So there have actually been arguments and maybe contentious debates back and forth. So notice what he says in verse 5: ""Have they not read the scriptures which say that ye must take upon you the name of Christ, which is my name? For by this name shall ye be called at the last day.""

So when establishing his church he's making a really big deal about the name being his own, that you've got to take upon you the name of Christ because name in scripture, especially in antiquity, is associated directly with power. This is the name or the power by which we do what we need to do moving forward.",1

2 Nephi 25:19–20, 26 — The Name of Jesus Christ It seems that Nephi, and many of the ancient prophets, had a well-developed and sophisticated understanding of the mission of Christ, of his life, and also of his name. In the ancient world, the people greatly appreciated the importance of what we call ""name theology."" We do not have quite the same appreciation today. They had to know the name of the god that they were worshipping, and the name was usually very holy, kept sacred, and only spoken under certain conditions.

In verse 19, Nephi knew and used the Savior's full name, Jesus Christ. Often, the Savior was referred to as the Only Begotten of the Father, the Father of Heaven and Earth, and the Son of God. There are a number of ways in which Nephi described the Messiah who was to come (see Figure 2). Possibly, the understanding of the Messiah's name was something that came gradually and Nephi, Jacob, and all the subsequent Nephite prophets from this point forward knew him by his name, Jesus Christ.

Nephi had deep respect for and interest in the name of God. I am sure he emphasized this. So, when Nephi taught that ""we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know,"" this would have been a very solemn, spiritual, and holy teaching of his time.

2 Nephi 25:23 — Persuading Our Children to Be Reconciled to God Nephi explained his purpose and focus in life: ""For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God.""

He explained, ""For by this name shall ye be called at the last day; And whoso taketh upon him my name, and endureth to the end, the same shall be saved at the last day."" (3 Ne. 27:5–6.) That same teaching is repeated in a modern revelation, which adds the caution that ""if they know not the name by which they are called, they cannot have place in the kingdom of my Father."" (D&C 18:25; see also Alma 5:38.)

The Book of Mormon explains the significance of being called by the name of Jesus Christ. When the Savior showed his spirit body to the brother of Jared, he introduced himself as the Father and the Son, declaring that through his redeeming sacrifice all mankind who believed on his name should have life eternal through him, ""and they shall become my sons and my daughters."" (Ether 3:14.) Abinadi said of those who believed in the Lord and looked to him for a remission of their sins ""that these are his seed, or they are heirs of the kingdom of God."" (Mosiah 15:11.) He continued this explanation as follows:

""For these are they whose sins he has borne; these are they for whom he has died, to redeem them from their transgressions. And now, are they not his seed?"" (Mosiah 15:12.)

Speaking through the prophet Alma, the Lord explained the significance of this relationship: ""For behold, in my name are they called; and if they know me they shall come forth, and shall have a place eternally at my right hand."" (Mosiah 26:24.)

In these great scriptures from the Book of Mormon, we learn that those who are qualified by faith and repentance and compliance with the laws and ordinances of the gospel will have their sins borne by the Lord Jesus Christ. In spiritual and figurative terms they will become the sons and daughters of Christ, heirs to his kingdom. These are they who will be called by his name in the last day.",3

The Book of Mormon testifies of Jesus Christ, giving emphasis and clarification to His teachings. The Book of Mormon prophet Nephi declared to the world, ""And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins"" (2 Ne. 25:26).

Nephi further stated, ""There is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved"" (2 Ne. 25:20).

Over the years I have pondered this experience with my friend Darlene, bothered by its conclusion. However, I have since concluded that viewpoints based on misunderstandings and fallacious teachings should not trouble me, except as I have a responsibility to attempt to clarify such misconceptions. The real issue is not how others define us but how the Savior defines us. So the question is, how does He personally view each and every one of us?

Therefore, as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we need to focus our concern with our own relationship to our Heavenly Father and the Savior, Jesus Christ.

In the last moments of my father's righteous and exemplary life, with all of the strength he could muster, he uttered in a hardly audible voice, ""I only hope the Savior will find me worthy to call me His friend."" Oh, to be called a friend of the Savior! As my father yearned, I also wondered, would Christ count me as one of His sheep? Would He see me striving to exemplify His teachings and live His divine principles? Would He call me a disciple? Would He call me a friend? This is what really matters.",3

Foremost and underpinning all that we do, anchored throughout the revelations, is the Lord's name, which is the authority by which we act in the Church. Every prayer offered, even by little children, ends in the name of Jesus Christ. Every blessing, every ordinance, every ordination, every official act is done in the name of Jesus Christ. It is His Church, and it is named for Him—The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (see D&C 115:4).

There is that great incident in the Book of Mormon where the Nephites ""were praying unto the Father in [the Lord's] name."" The Lord appeared and asked:

""What will ye that I shall give unto you?

""And they said unto him: Lord, we will that thou wouldst tell us the name whereby we shall call this church; for there are disputations among the people concerning this matter.

""And the Lord said unto them: Verily, verily, I say unto you, why is it that the people should murmur and dispute because of this thing?

""Have they not read the scriptures, which say ye must take upon you the name of Christ, which is my name? For by this name shall ye be called at the last day;

""And whoso taketh upon him my name, and endureth to the end, the same shall be saved. …

""Therefore, whatsoever ye shall do, ye shall do it in my name; therefore ye shall call the church in my name; and ye shall call upon the Father in my name that he will bless the church for my sake"" (3 Nephi 27:2–7).",2

He drew significantly and purposefully from the prophetic writings of Micah and Isaiah, Israelite prophets who had lived about a hundred years before the time of Lehi. Jesus used those prophecies to show the Nephites that some of these prophecies remained yet to be fulfilled. He expounded and contextualized these prophecies clearly and brilliantly. He assured these people that He, His Father, and his covenant people would work together to bring to pass the Father's glorious work.

The Book of Mormon reminds all who read it of the reliability of God. The Nephites certainly knew that mortals fail.16,"" KnoWhy 175 (August 29, 2016)."") Governments come and go, people are sometimes ""quick to do iniquity, and … slow to do good"" (Helaman 12:4). But the righteous Nephites knew with assurance that they could always rely on Christ to keep His covenants with them, even when all else failed. Modern readers can confidently take the same solace from the Book of Mormon. No matter how long ago Christ made these covenants with His people, they still apply to people today. Christ always kept His covenants with the Nephites, and He will always keep His covenants with those of the new and everlasting covenant today.",3

(2 Ne. 2:8.) Jesus displayed a missionary zeal, a fervent desire that all the children of God enjoy the blessings of his gospel. Isn't it interesting that the last chapter of each of the Gospels contains an appeal from the risen Lord to spread the gospel.

On the wall of the main floor of the Church Office Building in Salt Lake City is a magnificent mural depicting Jesus Christ as a resurrected being standing among his eleven Apostles as he gives them a stirring charge to be missionaries to all the world:

""Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

""Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen."" (Matt. 28:19–20.)

The Apostles who there stood with the Son of God responded to this call with faith, boldness, and power. We read that they were ""all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness."" (Acts 4:31.) They had seen a resurrected being, had eaten with him, had felt his hands and feet. They knew, and knowing, they testified: ""For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard."" (Acts 4:20.)

Does that commission extend to us as his disciples? Perhaps we have not seen, in person, the risen Lord. But the testimony of his chosen witnesses is etched into our hearts by the Holy Spirit. We know, and knowing, we too must testify. Is there any question in the mind of any of us that this is one of the chief responsibilities we enjoy by reason of our membership in his Church? I began with Mormon's declaration, ""I have been called of him to declare his word among his people, that they might have everlasting life."" (3 Ne. 5:13.) Such is the calling of each of us.",1

Jesus then taught the Nephites how to obtain all the blessings of the Father's plan of happiness, which are made available to us because of the Savior's Atonement, by teaching them the doctrine of Christ.4

My message today focuses on the doctrine of Christ. The scriptures define the doctrine of Christ as exercising faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repenting, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.5",3

Jesus followed this repeated injunction with a promised blessing: ""Therefore, if ye do these things blessed are ye, for ye shall be lifted up at the last day"" (3 Nephi 27:22). This commandment and its contingent blessing should prompt readers to pause and carefully review what works Jesus *did* during His ministry among the Nephites.

For instance, Christ's first action was to descend out of the heavens and visit His temple, thus establishing the temple as the sacred symbol of His presence (3 Nephi 11:8). He then ""stretched forth His hand"" and testified unto the people that He was ""Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world"" (vv. 9–10).1,"" KnoWhy 94 (May 6, 2016)."") In this way Jesus affirmed the recorded testimonies of the prophets who came before Him and demonstrated the importance of testifying of sacred truths.

After this, Christ said, ""Arise and come forth unto me"" (3 Nephi 11:14). This simple statement profoundly captures the essence of the Gospel. Just like the people at Bountiful, all of God's children are invited to come unto Christ by learning of His teachings and then experiencing Him for themselves by the power of the Holy Ghost (see Moroni 10:5, cf. Alma 32:28–35).

Jesus then allowed the people to ""thrust their hands into his side, and … feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet"" (3 Nephi 11:15). Allowing hundreds of individuals to experience physical contact with His divine body provided a powerful testimony of His resurrection.",2

The heavens were opened and had kissed the earth with certain knowledge. Then the Savior continued:

Each of us must come to our own personal testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ. We then share that testimony with our family and others.

In all of this, let us remember that there is an adversary who personally seeks to disrupt the work of the Lord. We must choose whom to follow. Our protection is as simple as deciding individually to follow the Savior, making certain that we faithfully will remain on His side.",3

And so we're so far only talking about the text of the Book of Abraham, but it seems like there's a lot that we don't know, and there's still plenty of room to say that Joseph Smith had these materials, translated either from these materials or was inspired by these materials, that the Book of Abraham comes from God.

Scott Woodward:

Yeah, and that's consistent with his other translation projects, right? Like the Book of Mormon, which was actually written in Reformed Egyptian. By the time Joseph was done translating the Book of Mormon, he still couldn't read Reformed Egyptian. At the end of the day, it came by the gift and power of God. It came by revelation. He got revelation through the use of seer stones, and there was little, if any, actually looking at the text of the Book of Mormon plates, right? He's not running his finger along the hieroglyphs, as far as any eyewitnesses say. He's actually just getting revelation through the instruments that were prepared for that purpose, as he focuses his faith on the plates themselves, right, and asks for revelation to come. So that's the Book of Mormon.

Casey Paul Griffiths:

Yeah. And the same with the Bible. When he translates the Bible, he's not claiming that he has the original manuscripts or that he can see them in vision. He is saying, by the means of the Holy Spirit, I am translating, and that's the word he uses, translating. So all this is consistent. All this is totally consistent.

Scott Woodward:

The parchment of John that we just talked about in D&C 7, again, Joseph never claimed to be able to read Greek. But the parchment was written in Greek, and then he got a translation in English through the use of seer stones here. And so let's review. Book of Mormon? Revelation. Parchment of John? Revelation. JST? Revelation. Book of Abraham?",3

Right? Revelation. Here's John Whitmer, early church historian. He records in July 1835 that Joseph Smith, ""by the revelation of Jesus Christ could translate these records, which gave an account of our forefathers, even Abraham."" So John Whitmer is at least recording what Joseph Smith was claiming, right? And this is not surprising. This is Joseph Smith's M. O. It's by revelation. And you quoted Warren Parrish earlier, that he says that Joseph, ""claimed to receive it by direct inspiration of heaven."" He's talking very much as an antagonist, but the story is consistent. Joseph claimed to translate the Book of Abraham the same way he ever claimed to translate anything, which was by revelation, not by learning the underlying source language, right? He's not learning Egyptian, Reformed Egyptian, Greek, anything like that. It's just by the gift and power of God. That's how Joseph always claimed to translate.

Casey Paul Griffiths:

The text is a catalyst

The entirety of what Joseph had was, indeed, nothing more than common Egyptian funerary texts, yet these texts started the ball rolling for a series of revelations that constitute the Book of Abraham, much in the same way the Book of Moses was received by revelation as Joseph read Genesis in the Old Testament.

So which of these positions is right? I don't think it's that cut and dried. My personal position has more in common with possibility #2 than any of the other two, but there are elements from #3, and even

#1, that cannot be entirely dismissed.

There is a fourth alternative, too, one that probably represents the majority opinion of members of the Church. That opinion is as follows:

* 4. It's scripture, so who cares?.

I do not share the second part of that opinion, but I emphatically share the first part. The Book of Abraham is arguably the most profound book of scripture we have in our possession, and the doctrines found therein define the relationship between God and his children in a way radically at odds with orthodox Christian thought and in a way that is wholly, uniquely Mormon. The importance of the idea that each of us, at our core, is co-eternal with God, cannot be overstated. The concept of pre-existence, the eternal nature of matter and the rejection of Ex Nihilo creation – all of that comes from the Book of Abraham, and, while hints of it can be found in the other standard works, nothing approaching the clarity and beauty of these magnificent truths can be found anywhere else.

The doctrine of Creatio Ex Nihilo, or Creation Out of Nothing, is central to much of the Christian world. As I understand it, the idea is that there was nothing in the universe, or even no universe itself. There was only God. And at one point, God decided He wanted there to be
Something instead of Nothing. And so, out of Nothing, he made Something, and voila! Here we are!",1

Belief that he was a real person is shared by others, but the LDS approach is unique: Revelations received by the Prophet Joseph Smith confirm the basic historicity of Genesis and add information echoed in ancient sources, many of which have emerged since his day.

The book of Abraham as restored by Joseph Smith autobiographically recounts Abraham's early life, explaining why he was singled out as the pivotal recipient of divine promises for the blessing of mankind. Not only had he been foreordained in premortal life (Abr. 3:23; cf. *Apocalypse of Abraham* 22:1-5), but as a young man in Ur he opposed idolatry and human sacrifice, ironically turning him into an intended victim (Abr. 1:5-20; cf. *Genesis Rabbah* 38:13). The irony increases when God's last-minute rescue of Abraham foreshadowed what would transpire at Abraham's offering of Isaac.

After marrying Sarah and learning of his lineal right to the patriarchal order of the priesthood as disclosed in the ""records of the fathers"" (Abr. 1:2-4, 26, 31;2:2; *Jubilees* 12:27; cf. D&C 107:40-57), Abraham traveled to Haran, where he apparently received his ordination (Abr. 2:9-11; *WJS*, pp. 245, 303). He also saw the Lord, who gave him remarkable promises: Abraham would be blessed above measure; his posterity would carry the gospel to all nations; and all who received it would bear his name, be accounted his posterity, and bless him as their father (Abr. 2:6-11; cf. Gen. 12:1-3).",0

And so to think more clearly through this issue, to think slowly, it's helpful, we talked about last time, to know that Egyptian Jews often used Egyptian drawings, which had an original Egyptian meaning, and then they would give them a new layer of biblical meaning, such as to tell stories about Abraham. Also, there is evidence of Egyptian priests using Jewish stories and ideas in their writing. So it kind of goes both ways, right? They'd kind of cross -pollinate and culturally appropriate from one another. And this borrowing from each other and giving secondary meanings to Egyptian hieroglyphics could easily account for the disagreement between what modern Egyptologists say the fragments mean, i. e., the original Egyptian meaning, and what Joseph Smith interpreted them to mean, which is that secondary meaning that's been applied to the hieroglyph to tell Abraham's stories.",2

While the critics claim that the interpretations of the graphics in the different facsimiles don't match what Egyptologists claim they represent, the fact is that A) Joseph Smith is surprisingly accurate on at least a few of the interpretations, and B) some of those graphics might have been repurposed by 2nd century Jews to mean something else.

What seems likely to me is that whatever text and artwork was on the papyrus contained some kind of mixture of both truth and embellishment, and Joseph, via revelation, was able to extract the divine gold buried under the man-made dross. That would also mean that both Joseph and the Egyptologists are correct at the same time – the figure with the phallus represented Min, but thousands of years earlier, it represented God the Father, yet that interpretation was later modified and lost until Joseph the Seer was able to find it again.

That explanation, which does not tidily fit into the box of one of the three possible explanations I previously offered for the Book of Abraham, is the one that best matches the existing evidence.

Scott Woodward: Gotcha. Okay, so the major controversy surrounding the Kirtland Egyptian papers is that the conclusions they came to in terms of the meaning of the hieroglyphs are just flat wrong. And so that's it. Now, whatever assumptions you want to bring to that, that's where things can get complicated, but the facts of the matter are that they got it wrong. Their efforts to translate hieroglyphics in an academic way proved erroneous, basically.",2

So when the artist and the author are different people, he said, you typically expect the picture to be separate from the text, and so he said that's not uncommon. It's actually about 50-50 that you'll find that the text right next to the picture is not about the picture, and about 50 percent of the time it is. So that's interesting, right?

Actually, the text matches after all! Sorry for the confusion. Egyptologists are unanimously wrong, and the Book of the Dead as it appears in all other papyri is, in fact, the Book of Abraham.

In the book of Abraham, God teaches Abraham about the sun, the moon, and the stars. ""I show these things unto thee before ye go into Egypt,"" the Lord says, ""that ye may declare all these words."" Ancient texts repeatedly refer to Abraham instructing the Egyptians in knowledge of the heavens. For example, Eupolemus, who lived under Egyptian rule in the second century B.C.E., wrote that Abraham taught astronomy and other sciences to the Egyptian priests. A third- century papyrus from an Egyptian temple library connects Abraham with an illustration similar to facsimile 1 in the book of Abraham. A later Egyptian text, discovered in the 20th century, tells how the Pharaoh tried to sacrifice Abraham, only to be foiled when Abraham was delivered by an angel. Later, according to this text, Abraham taught members of the Pharaoh's court through astronomy. All these details are found in the book of Abraham.

It is therefore incorrect to say that the Church ""admits"" these fragments ""have nothing to do with Abraham,"" particularly since Facsimile 1, which is linked to Abraham by these other ancient texts, is included in the fragments. And as Nibley noted, the other Egyptian traditions mentioned in this essay make a correlation between the two texts far more plausible.

We look at the three theories of what source material Joseph Smith translated from and how he did it, and we trace what we know of what happened to the papyri after Joseph's death, how many fragments have survived to this day, and what modern Egyptologists think about those surviving fragments, which is the source of the two biggest controversies about the Book of Abraham.

Thus, it is not surprising that Egyptian texts are somehow linked to the appearance of the Book of Abraham.

According to some Egyptologists, the writings of Abraham acquired by Joseph Smith are to be dated to the early Christian era. Such dating is not without precedent.

Some of Joseph's interpretations of the symbols and figures on the facsimiles are pretty spot-on, as we'll talk about when we actually dive into those interpretations.

Yeah, this leads to the first of two major criticisms of the Book of Abraham, actually, the finding of those fragments, because nothing in those existing papyri fragments correspond to anything in Joseph's Book of Abraham translation. Like, that's a big problem, right? There is nothing about Abraham in them, period. In fact, Facsimile number 1, when modern Egyptologists look at Facsimile 1, they say that it is a funerary text called the Book of Breathings. In other words, it's nothing remotely about Abraham. In fact, in the Gospel Topics essay on the Book of Abraham, it says this: ""Mormon and non-Mormon Egyptologists agree that the characters on the fragments do not match the translation given in the Book of Abraham, though there is not unanimity, even among non-Mormon scholars, about the proper interpretation of the vignettes on these fragments."" So you can't really see this on Facsimile 1 in your scriptures, but if you go to the Joseph Smith papers site and you look at the fragment itself, you'll notice over to the right hand side, on the right hand side of the fragment, there is hieroglyphics in three columns.

For example, even eyewitness participants in the translation of the Book of Mormon sometimes confused the terminology in their descriptions of the event. ""These two instruments—the interpreters and the seer stone—were apparently interchangeable and worked in much the same way such that, in the course of time, Joseph Smith and his associates often used the term 'Urim and Thummim' to refer to the single stone as well as the interpreters.""7

Despite these ambiguities, it is clear that Joseph utilized sacred instruments—in this case seer stones that he found or the interpreters, which Moroni gave him—that had been prepared by the Lord for the purpose of translating the Book of Mormon. Questions remain as to how Joseph used these instruments, such as when precisely he used which devices during the translation process. That the Prophet did in fact utilize divinely-prepared instruments as mediums for inspiration in the translation of the Book of Mormon and some early revelations (e.g. Doctrine and Covenants 3, 6, 7, 11, 14, 17), however, is beyond dispute.",3

More work has been done in this area since President Smith's tenure as leader of this Church. We obviously know more now about the translation process than he did. He was mistaken. It happens. It was also probably a lapse in judgment to state his opinion so directly when there was a chance others would see it as revelation rather than opinion.

However, he did clarify that it was his personal belief that it was incorrect. He also said that reports of Joseph using the Urim and Thummim after the plates were given back to Moroni were ""evidently"" errors. And he was right that all of the accounts including this information are from people other than Joseph himself. Technically, they *could* be classified as ""hearsay,"" though many of the accounts were given firsthand from people who witnessed the translation unfolding in front of their own eyes.

He maybe should have taken his position and audience into account when giving his opinion, but he was clear that it *was* his opinion. His statements were not nearly as forceful as critics would have us believe. They aren't even as forceful as Faulk himself, who has so far made *several* declarations of fact that were incorrect. And frankly, President Smith was entitled to hold those opinions. We know now that he was mistaken, but that doesn't lessen his calling as a prophet. It also doesn't change the fact that we're *all*allowed to hold opinions that may end up being wrong. We're human. It happens. It's what happened here.",3

Not only did David Whitmer observe the miraculous translation unfold day after day, but he also saw Joseph's human weakness. Ironically, that very weakness offered evidence that the Prophet's extraordinary ability was indeed a *gift* from God; it could be taken away when he wasn't worthy of it, just as the Book of Mormon warns.

Similarly, when Martin Harris discreetly swapped out Joseph's seer stone for an average rock of similar appearance, Joseph saw only darkness—just as Martin expected and just as the Book of Mormon predicted. From his own experience, Martin came to believe that something really was special about Joseph Smith's revelatory instruments. In some miraculous way, they had been *prepared* by the Lord for a marvelous purpose.

I just want to say that to all of our listeners here, if you're like most people who live in this age of enlightenment, then the idea that a 23-year-old Joseph Smith translated an ancient record by looking at rocks in the bottom of his hat can feel uneasy, and it can strain the belief gene, you know? And so to those in that camp I say I understand you. I'll say that what helped me believe that such a thing was possible is the actual text of the Book of Mormon itself. As I've read the Book of Mormon carefully, examined its complexity, its beauty, its compelling witness of Christ, and then studying the eyewitness accounts we've been talking about, repeatedly and consistently that he had no manuscripts, he had nothing, he was looking at rocks in the bottom of his hat while he was doing this translation—he would read and we would write, and that's it. Like, that's how it worked. When I think about that, I think, well, if that kind of a book with that beauty and complexity and compelling witness, came through a 23-year-old seer looking at seer stones in his hat, then I guess I'm a believer in seer stones. Right? I'm as much a child of the enlightenment as any listener here. I've never seen anything close to anyone work with seer stones, but I've read the Book of Mormon, and for me the proof is in the end product, right? That product sings. So the evidence, when carefully examined for me, is highly, highly suspicious of a miracle. I believe that's the best way to explain it, is that this was a miracle.",1

The Book of Mormon stands as a miraculous work for the world to examine. This divine spark from heaven, over 165 years ago, has ignited a flame that is dawning a new day. No wonder ""the Spirit of God like a fire is burning!"" (*Hymns,* 1985, no. 2). All over the world people are seeking the witness of Jesus Christ as found in the Book of Mormon. They come from every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. As was revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, ""The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name"" (D&C 122:1). And why are they seeking after the name of Joseph Smith? Because the Book of Mormon testifies of the divinity and atonement of the Savior, Jesus Christ. Because Joseph is the prophet of the Restoration.

With deep appreciation for the miracle that transpired through the translation of the Book of Mormon, we sing:

*Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah!*

*Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer.*

*Blessed to open the last dispensation. …*

*Millions shall know ""Brother Joseph"" again.*

The Book of Mormon is the ""keystone of our religion"" and will bring us ""nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book"" (*Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,* p. 194).

*In frontier America, seer stones or ""peep stones"" were commonly used by lost object finders, people engaged in the widespread practice of lost treasure digging, and sometimes by people seeking to uncover the kind of truths we might call a private or police detective for today. It is unclear how much of this kind of activity Joseph Smith was involved in, except for water divining and treasure digging, which are widely attested. The ""seer"" in seer stone is a biblically literate early American culture's reference to the biblical term* seer *explained in 1 Samuel 9:9 as an earlier term for a prophet—more specifically one who saw visions, dreams, or scenes in the mind's eye, or even with the natural eyes. Moreover, God gives the seer insight into the meaning of his or her visions (2 Sam. 24:11; 2 Chr. 9:29; Jer. 1:11–18). All of this fits quite nicely with how Joseph Smith saw himself.*

*To Bible scholars, the Urim and Thummim is one of several items similar to the* ephod *and* lots *used to determine the will of God or seek information from him. (The Liahona in the Book of Mormon follows this pattern.) It seems that early Mormons began to use the terms* seer stone *and* Urim and Thummim *interchangeably, with the latter convention winning the day.

There are actually multiple stories of how Joseph discovered his stones, and some of them conflict. Mark Ashurst-McGee traces much of the history and clarifies many of the conflicted stories in his Master's thesis, which is archived at Book of Mormon Central. The *Ensign* article in question does not specify exactly how Joseph came to be in possession of this particular stone.

According to Ashurst-McGee, he seems to have discovered the brown stone first by looking into his neighbor Sally Chase's seer stone, and then discovered the *white* stone second, in the Chase property well. He also eventually found two others in and around Nauvoo.

The white stone is the one that Martin claimed Joseph used to find lost objects, including a pin Martin had dropped into a pile of straw and wood shavings. It also appears to be this stone that Martin switched, leaving Joseph temporarily unable to translate. However, later translation witnesses described Joseph using his brown stone. So, he potentially used at least four stones to translate the plates: the white one, the brown one, and the two Nephite interpreters.

Essentially, the brown seer stone pictured in the *Ensign* article is *not* ""the very same stone Joseph found while digging in a well on the property of Willard Chase in 1822."" However, it *is* one of two of Joseph's personal seer stones potentially used during the translation process.",0

If someone comes up to you and says, ""Hey, I've got George Washington's hat."" I wouldn't pay a lot of money for that without saying, ""Can you prove to me that it's his hat?"" With this seer stone, the provenance is fairly brief. It's just Joseph to Oliver to Elizabeth to Phineas to Brigham, which is incredibly brief. And it's been in church possession more or less since the 1850s. The other ones don't have any kind of clear sense of provenance. And so they're there, and that's interesting, but I wouldn't associate any historical events with these other seer stones, if that makes sense.

In the world Joseph Smith lived in, it doesn't seem like it was associated with occult practices. Mike Mackay and Nick Frederick have written a great book called Joseph Smith's Seer Stones where they just went back and looked at, you know, Palmyra newspapers, other documents, and found that there were multiple people that possessed seer stones. For instance, the Wayne Sentinel, that is the newspaper in Palmyra, in 1825, so this is after Moroni's appeared to Joseph Smith, but before Joseph gets the plates, that's in 1827, has an article where they said buried treasure had been found, quote, ""by the help of a mineral stone, which becomes transparent when placed in a hat and the light excluded by the face of him who looks into it."" Now that sounds really familiar, doesn't it? And it's being reported here in a local newspaper as kind of a, hey, this thing happened. So it was considered to be special, but not considered to be like a cult at the time. Christianity and folk magic kind of went hand in hand and weren't seen as diametrically opposed during this time. In fact, a lot of the notoriety Joseph Smith receives as a young man before he has the plates is because he's seen as someone that can use a seer stone and has specific gifts associated with it. I mean, that's one thing that you've got to kind of center yourself in the culture to say ""This does seem strange to us, but it doesn't seem like it was that strange or unknown to Joseph Smith or his contemporaries.""",2

And a lot of them also say other things, which is part of the reason for the confusion. Most of the eyewitness accounts conflict with each other in various ways. These aren't like the First Vision accounts, where they all tell the same story though some have additional details others don't. Some have a curtain between Joseph and his scribe, some say it was all done out in the open. Some say the Nephite interpreters were used, some say it was Joseph's brown seer stone. Some say he used the spectacles, some say he used his hat. Some say he read the plates, others say the words appeared in the stone. Etc. It has since been determined that most of those things are correct for different portions of the translation. Initially, though, it did create rather a lot of confusion for historians.

Furthering that confusion was the fact that both the Nephite interpreters and Joseph's personal stone were referred to as the ""Urim and Thummim."" That became a generic term used by the early Saints for any kind of seer stone. This made it difficult to understand which stone or stones was being used.

And unfortunately, as both David Whitmer and Emma Smith left the main body of the Church and refused to go West, and both actively denounced plural marriage, they were looked on with suspicion and even hostility by several generations of Latter-day Saints. That made the Saints less inclined to believe their testimonies. In fact, Joseph Fielding Smith referred to accounts of Joseph's seer stone as ""hearsay"" in Volume 3 of *Doctrines of Salvation*, saying he didn't believe it was used at all.",2

Brother Joseph would read off the English to Oliver Cowdery, who was his principal scribe, and when it was written down and repeated to Brother Joseph to see if it was correct, then it would disappear, and another character with the interpretation would appear.

It did catch me off-guard, obviously. But almost immediately, the questions came into my mind, ""Does it matter? Does it change anything?"" And I thought about it for a minute, then realized it didn't. It didn't affect my testimony at all. Joseph Smith using two seer stones in spectacles and Joseph Smith using his personal seer stone in a hat were essentially the same thing to me. All that was different was that I was learning more of the actual details. To me, it was like the way I'd added pre-algebra to my knowledge of math that year in school. It was just adding new knowledge to my existing knowledge.

However, some people reacted very strongly to the information. I don't dismiss that at all; it just wasn't my experience. To me, it only warranted a temporary pause and then I shrugged and said, ""I guess I didn't know as much about it as I thought I did."" But to others, it was deeply unsettling.

It was believed that Joseph could see the location of lost articles by way of a seer stone (this was, it should be remembered, before Joseph Smith acquired the Book of Mormon plates). Stowell's sons weren't too happy that their dad was giving money to search for lost treasure and therefore had Joseph brought to court on charges of fraud.

While Joseph Smith never had any luck finding buried treasure, some of the townspeople believed that he did, indeed, have the gift of a ""seer"" and recounted tales of how he had once found a lost tooth pin in a pile of straw, and how he was able to describe houses and trees hundreds of miles away (all which were verified by people who had actually seen the places being described).

Whether or not Joseph Smith could see such things is irrelevant to the fact that both he and those who hired him believed that he could see such things. Someone can believe something and be wrong, but sincerely believing in something wrong doesn't make that person a con artist or fraud (and we can't necessarily rule out the possibility that he did indeed see lost objects in his seer stone despite the fact that such things run contrary to modern scientific sensibilities).",1

 The author was perfectly fine as a 21st century Mormon when he believed that Joseph used two seer stones mounted in a frame shaped like a ""figure eight"" to convert ""reformed Egyptian"" characters into English, but confused by the stone and the hat.

Yeah. I just like the idea that—Mark Ashurst-McGee, he did his master's thesis on Joseph's seer stones. I like his progression: He says that it seems that Joseph began as, like, a little, local village seer, who just had this gift to be able to see the unseen using this object, a seer stone. And then God chose him to be his Seer, capital S, and helped him develop his spiritual gifts to put them to a lot better use, for instance, translating the Book of Mormon. That's going to be much more significant than finding some lost object. So this transition from village seer to the Lord's prophet, seer, and revelator, it seems like that's the path. He already had this gift even before he was officially called to be the prophet. And so we see what God did with the boy with those gifts. So yeah, you're right, the modern listener or reader, researcher, you kind of have to just get into their worldview to understand what we're about to talk about. The eyewitness accounts of the translation of the Book of Mormon, this is not a secular translation. This is supernatural, and we have multiple witnesses, primary and secondary, that all point to this same story, there's a little differing details that will point out, but they're all the same essential story. So—

Casey Paul Griffiths:

Right. Well, and I would say too, there's multiple witnesses, a ton of witnesses, that this is a miracle. And some of those witnesses have slightly different details. Some people talk about Nephite interpreters, some people talk about the seer stone. They are all united in saying this was a miraculous process. This wasn't a normal—it was a miracle in their sight.

> *…[C]onsider the matter from Joseph's point of view: He's being called upon to reveal things that are hidden, and to translate an ancient record. Joseph is painfully aware that he cannot do these things. How could Joseph know that he wasn't going crazy or being delusional? Tying his early prophetic work to something with which he had already had objective success (the use of the seer stone) allowed Joseph to trust both God and himself. The Lord seems to have used Joseph's preexisting beliefs about how the world worked (including seer stones to reveal hidden things) to help Joseph gain confidence in his own abilities. The Nephite interpreters had been blessed and dedicated for the purpose of translating the Book of Mormon—this would have increased Joseph's faith, and they* did *help him receive revelation more effectively, initially. This is what excited Joseph more than even the plates themselves—he was able to do more with the Nephite stones. With time, Joseph was able to translate with his ""original"" stone—thus, his own ability had increased, because he no longer needed the ""stronger"" Nephite stones. Eventually, he did not require the ""prop"" or ""crutch"" of the stone at all—his faith and experience had grown.*

>

So, as Joseph progressed in faith and ability, he moved from needing the ""stronger"" Interpreters to his own stone, to no stone at all in order to receive revelation. Heavenly Father used objects Joseph was familiar with in order to teach him how to stand on his own and have confidence in his abilities and talents. Over a period of time, the Lord taught Joseph how to receive revelation and how to recognize it when he did. Eventually, Joseph didn't need any additional help.

Meanwhile, Joseph and Oliver started translating. They worked well together, weeks on end, frequently with Emma in the same room going about her daily work. Sometimes Joseph translated by looking through the interpreters and reading in English the characters on the plates.

Often he found a single seer stone to be more convenient. He would put the seer stone in his hat, place his face into the hat to block out the light, and peer at the stone. Light from the stone would shine in the darkness, revealing words that Joseph dictated as Oliver rapidly copied them down.

Oliver gave it to his wife, Elizabeth, who's a member of the Whitmer family, and when Oliver dies, Elizabeth gave it to Phineas Young, who gave it to Brigham Young, and that's how it stays in our possession. And again, it fits the description that some people, especially Emma Smith, gave of a seer stone that was associated with translation. So that's kind of neat to think that one of the instruments of translation is still in our possession.",2

If we had video footage of the translation process of The Book of Mormon, what would we see? What would we actually watch Joseph Smith do during a translation session? Now, of course, we don't have such video footage, but we do have perhaps the next best thing: multiple eyewitness accounts of those who saw the process up close, firsthand. And what they said they saw was a decidedly nonsecular, nonacademic, one-of-a-kind translation method involving a young, 22- and 23-year-old Joseph Smith looking at seer stones in a hat, a process many of these witnesses described as, ""truly miraculous."" In today's episode we take a closer look at what we can know from the historical record about Joseph Smith's translation process. We'll also briefly explore the New England subculture in Joseph's day in which some believed that people with certain spiritual gifts could use special objects, like seer stones or divining rods, to channel to divine power to do things like find lost objects or find underground water sources. We'll also discuss the fascinating details of what we know about how and when Joseph came upon two seer stones in addition to those that came with the plates and were bound together in silver bows, and what we know about his using these during the Book of Mormon translation.

Scientifically this account leaves many questions unanswered, especially how a measurable depth could cover mountains. Elder John A. Widtsoe, writing in 1943, offered this perspective:
The fact remains that the exact nature of the flood is not known. We set up assumptions, based upon our best knowledge, but can go no further. We should remember that when inspired writers deal with historical incidents they relate that which they have seen or that which may have been told them, unless indeed the past is opened to them by revelation.

The details in the story of the flood are undoubtedly drawn from the experiences of the writer. Under a downpour of rain, likened to the opening of the heavens, a destructive torrent twenty-six feet deep or deeper would easily be formed. The writer of Genesis made a faithful report of the facts known to him concerning the flood. In other localities the depth of the water might have been more or less. In fact, the details of the flood are not known to us [Widtsoe, p. 127].",3

The exact nature of the Flood is unknown. It could have been global, though that seems to be unlikely by current scientific findings; it could have been local, which scholars such as Hugh Nibley seem to believe; or it could have been largely symbolic, as Ben Spackman posits. Heavenly Father clearly feels that the exact details are less important than the lessons we can learn from this story, and He hasn't seen fit to clarify the matter.

There are massive ziggurats and their ruins all over Mesopotamia even today, including an especially large one in what was once ancient Babylon, and one of them easily could have been the Tower of Babel. So, just like the Flood, the confusion of languages at the tower could have been a localized event (the Hebrew word for ""earth"" that was used in that story also could have meant ""land""). It also could have been symbolic. The only things that we know for certain is that it was not a worldwide confusion of languages, and that the Jaredites fled from the Tower so that their own language would not be corrupted.",2

* ***Global flood******: 4,500 years ago***

The great flood didn't have to be global. That was in the days before cars, trains, planes, etc. It was not common for people to travel long distances when it would have had to have been on foot, camel, or horseback. For many people, traveling more than a few hundred miles in any direction during the course of their lifetimes would have been unthinkable. So, it would have been natural for a large local flood to seem like it flooded the entire world.

When Church leaders refer to it, they do tend to refer to it as a global flood because that's what the scriptures say. But they also occasionally say otherwise. For example, in the *Encyclopedia of Mormonism*, John A. Widtsoe is quoted as saying:

> *The fact remains that the exact nature of the flood is not known. We set up assumptions, based upon our best knowledge, but can go no further. We should remember that when inspired writers deal with historical incidents they relate that which they have seen or that which may have been told them, unless indeed the past is opened to them by revelation.

### FAIR's Response

#### Fact checking results: The author has stated erroneous information or misinterpreted their sources

 The Church does not require a belief in a global flood, despite BYU professor Donald W. Parry's article in the *Ensign*. What the Church teaches is that Noah was a real prophet, and that he was commanded to save his family along with a number of animals in an ark from a flood which covered his world.

**Longer response(s) to criticism:**

In response to Cain's murder, the Lord declared, ""The voice of thy brother's blood cries unto me from the ground"" (v. 35).

This type of literary repetition and borrowing found in separate stories can be seen in the Bible as well. For instance, aspects of the construction of the Israelite tabernacle have been found to mirror Noah's construction of the Ark, which in turn mirrors the creation of the world.44

In a similar way, the story of the Jaredite exodus found in the book of Ether may intentionally hark back to stories of a previous flood hero, some of which may have been known to the brother of Jared and his people. It is possible, and potentially useful, to read the brother of Jared's experience as a refutation or correction to Mesopotamian views about gods and man.

Many LDS believe that the flood was localized—to Noah, the ""earth"" (and this is supported by how the word is used in Hebrew) would have referred to the land in his vicinity. Noah would not have known about the earth in a global sense (as we do today). If everything he saw was underwater, to his world the ""earth"" would have been flooded.

* 77) Science discredits the Bible.

Answer: The Bible is not a history book or a science book and doesn't claim to be. Ancient cultures had a much different view of literature than we have today. God did not (and does not) reveal every detail of every scientific or historical fact to every prophet (there is no need for such revelations). Biblical authors had pre-scientific worldviews and wrote according to how they understood things in their day. As Galileo said, paraphrasing Cardinal Baronius (the Vatican's librarian), the intent of scripture is ""to teach us how one goes to heaven, not how heaven goes.""38

The Church does not require its members to believe any scientific information about a global flood, least of all that it took place 4,500 years ago.

Humans and animals having their origins from Noah's family and the animals contained in the ark 4,500 years ago. It is scientifically impossible, for example, for the bear to have evolved into several species (Sun Bear, Polar Bear, Grizzly Bear, etc.) from common ancestors from Noah's time just a few thousand years ago.

It's cool that you really like bears. Why would they have had to evolve since Noah's time? Why couldn't there have been all those different bears on the ark? You're making assumptions here based on very little information.

Mind you, I'm not saying there were all those different kinds of bears on the ark - I don't know how much of Noah's ark is literal and how much is figurative, so I don't much care.

There are a host of other impossibilities associated with Noah's Ark story claims.

Maybe this makes me naive, but I feel no need to raise my hand in Sunday School and point out the scientific improbability of Noah's ark, but neither do I get indignant when a biology teacher describes the evolutionary process. There's room in the Church for people who believe all sorts of things about science, and there's no litmus test requiring any degree of literal scriptural interpretation. Latter-day Saint theology teaches that we should seek after truth wherever we can find it, which means we should learn more about science, not less.

### FAIR's Response

#### Fact checking results: This claim is false

 This is a misrepresentation. FairMormon has never claimed ""the impossibility of Noah's ark."" We believe that the prophet Noah existed, that he was commanded to build an ark, that he was commended to gather animals, and that he and his family were saved from a flood which covered his world. It is only the scope of that flood that produces differences of opinion.
### Logical Fallacy: Strawman—The author sets up a weakened or caricatured version of the opponent's argument. The author then proceeds to demolish the weak version of the argument, and claim victory.

The world, so the story proclaims, does not exist because of the great many evildoers (cf. 6:1–4), not even in spite of them, but for the sake of those like Noah, be there even but one in a generation, who follows his conscience and does 'as commanded' (6:22; 7:5, 10).

Eighteen centuries after announcing Christ's birth, Noah-again as Gabriel-visited the Prophet Joseph Smith to restore priesthood keys (D&C 128:21). Noah is to return to earth after Christ's second coming to attend the Marriage Supper of the Lamb (D&C 27:5-7).",0

Lamech chose the name Noah because of the ""comfort"" the child would bring to his family in their toil (8:9). Though Noah had brothers and sisters, nothing about them is known (8:10).

A promised child of noble ancestry, including Adam and other ""preachers of righteousness"" (Moses 6:22-23), Noah was ordained to the priesthood at age ten by Methuselah (D&C 107:52), an unusually young age when compared with the ages at which other antediluvian Patriarchs were ordained (D&C 107:42-51).",3

The Book of Mormon holds up well under scrutiny and does not need to be propped up by improper use of science.

Unfortunately for the critics, Latter-day Saints don't believe that an LDS prophet suddenly becomes a robot who is unable to have his own thoughts and opinions (even if those opinions are wrong).

For instance, an LDS geneticist from Italy found that his paternal genetic marker was more typical of East Asian ancestry. If something similar was the case with the founders of Book of Mormon populations, identifying their descendants using DNA would be impossible.10, 179–192. ""Unfortunately, no matter how large or small they eventually became as a people in the American continent, Lehi's family still was a very small initial group with extremely limited genetic variation that would not constitute a large enough sample of their native population to ensure that their genetics would be properly represented in the New World"" (p. 186)."")

Even if Jared's, Mulek's, and Lehi's DNA were typical of the regions of their origins, the reality is that most genetic information from the past does not survive into present populations. Most DNA studies on Native Americans are dependent upon DNA markers which pass from one generation to the next along paternal and maternal lines. Because such markers do not get mixed from one generation to the next, these lineages are easy to trace back several generations. However, in total they only represent 0.01 percent of a person's DNA.11, 249."")",3

For this and other reasons, ""DNA studies cannot be used decisively to either affirm or reject the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon.""16,"" KnoWhy 280 (February 27, 2018)."")

Finally, the unmentioned presence of other peoples should help us remember why the Book of Mormon was written in the first place. Nephi explained, ""I do not write anything upon plates save it be that I think it be sacred"" (1 Nephi 19:6).17,"" KnoWhy 74 (April 8, 2016)."") Mormon similarly stated that his record was written so that a remnant of his people would ""know concerning your fathers, and also the marvelous works which were wrought by the power of God among them"" (Mormon 7:9).18,"" KnoWhy 230 (November 14, 2016)."")

In essence, the Book of Mormon is a spiritual and religious history. Its focus is on particular groups of people, their sacred revelations, and their miraculous experiences. It was never meant to be a cultural survey of the Nephites and Jaredites, or any of the others who interacted with them. Its narrow spiritual focus can help us remember to similarly prioritize spiritual things—especially the realty and teachings of Jesus Christ—in our own lives.

As Elder Russell M. Nelson explained,

> Some authors have focused upon [the Book of Mormon's] stories, its people, or its vignettes of history. Others have been intrigued by its language structure or its records of weapons, geography, animal life, techniques of building, or systems of weights and measures.

>
> Interesting as these matters may be, study of the Book of Mormon is most rewarding when one focuses on its *primary* purpose—to testify of Jesus Christ. By comparison, all other issues are incidental.19

 The implication by the author is that the Church retreated from the definition of ""Lamanite"" by altering the introduction to the Book of Mormon that was added in the 1920's. This is incorrect. If Lehi's people intermarried with *anyone* from the existing New World population, then by definition they are certainly among the ancestors of every native American currently living, and thus qualify under the Church's definition of ""Lamanite."" The only way critics can make the DNA data to be a weapon against the Book of Mormon is to *force* a hemispheric interpretation of an empty North and South American continent at the time of arrival of the Lehites. This is why critics *must*, at all costs, negate the Limited Geography Theory of the Book of Mormon.

We don't have any idea what Jaredite DNA would have looked like. We don't know where they came from, who they mixed with along their journey, or where they ended up, or if any of that DNA spread to existing populations. We don't have any idea what Sariah's lineage was, or Zoram's, or Ishmael's wife's. All we know is that Lehi is from the tribe of Manasseh and, as explained by Don Bradley, Ishmael was from the tribe of Ephraim. We don't know what Mulekite DNA would have looked like, as we have no idea who helped him escape Jerusalem or what route they took along the way, or who may have been added to their group during their travels. We have no idea which native populations any of them intermingled with, or to what extent. And that's even assuming his story in the Book of Mormon is an accurate description of what really happened to him and wasn't distorted over the centuries before his people were discovered by the Nephites. Given all of that, we have absolutely no idea what the genetic makeup of the groups in the Book of Mormon even looked like to begin with, let alone what it might look like when it's mixed with existing Native populations.

As the Church's Gospel Topics essay on DNA says, ""It is possible that each member of the emigrating parties described in the Book of Mormon had DNA typical of the Near East, but it is likewise possible that some of them carried DNA more typical of other regions. In this case, their descendants might inherit a genetic profile that would be unexpected given their family's place of origin. This phenomenon is called the founder effect.""",3

Finally, in the unlikely event that some DNA from the founding members of Book of Mormon peoples did survive in the present day, detection is complicated by post-Columbian admixture of Native Americans and Old World peoples.

When we accept the ancient roots of the book and believe that Joseph Smith did have ancient records that could not be in English, we then may ask how he translated them. The only reasonable answer is the way he said: by divine revelation.

What would be more perilous to us, eternally, than to say the Book of Mormon is holy scripture if it were not? Those who have questions or concerns about the Church may cling in security to this firm anchor that is immutable and tangible evidence of the truthfulness of the Church.

The Book of Mormon prophet Nephi wrote: ""For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do"" (2 Ne. 25:23).",2

(See D&C 20:8–9; D&C 27:5.) In a day when many are challenging the divinity of Jesus Christ or doubting the reality of his atonement and resurrection, the message of that second witness, the Book of Mormon, is needed more urgently than ever.

President Ezra Taft Benson has reminded us again and again that the Book of Mormon ""was written for our day"" and that it ""is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ."" (*Ensign,* Nov. 1986, pp. 5–6.) I believe that the reason our Heavenly Father has had his prophet direct us into a more intensive study of the Book of Mormon is that this generation needs its message more than any of its forebears. As President Benson has said, the Book of Mormon ""provides the most complete explanation of the doctrine of the Atonement,"" and ""its testimony of the Master is clear, undiluted, and full of power."" (*Ensign,* Nov. 1986, p. 5.)",3

They teach that He is the Son of God, that He lived an exemplary life, that He atoned for all mankind, that He died upon the cross and rose again as the resurrected Lord. They teach that He is the Savior of the world.

Scriptural witnesses authenticate each other. This concept was explained long ago when a prophet wrote that the Book of Mormon was ""written for the intent that ye may believe [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe [the Book of Mormon] also.""6 Each book refers to the other. Each book stands as evidence that God lives and speaks to His children by revelation to His prophets.7

Love for the Book of Mormon expands one's love for the Bible and vice versa. Scriptures of the Restoration do not compete with the Bible; they complement the Bible. We are indebted to martyrs who gave their lives so that we could have the Bible. It establishes the everlasting nature of the gospel and of the plan of happiness. The Book of Mormon restores and underscores biblical doctrines such as tithing,8 the temple,9 the Sabbath day,10 and the priesthood.11

An angel proclaimed that the Book of Mormon12 shall establish the truth of the Bible.13 He also revealed that writings in the Bible available in our day are not as complete as they were when originally written by prophets and apostles.14 He declared that the Book of Mormon shall restore plain and precious things taken away from the Bible.15",2

(History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 4:461.)

We believe the Bible to be the word of God, but I have often asked missionaries what they would do without the Book of Mormon and modern revelation. With just the Bible, what would be their approach? The Prophet Joseph answered it. ""Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations and where is our religion? We have none."" (HC, 2:52.)

If the Book of Mormon is not true, then Joseph Smith was not a prophet of God. I testify to you that the Book of Mormon is true and that the revelations contained in the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price and other places are true and of the Lord. Our message to the world is that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that God has revealed himself to man in this dispensation and restored his gospel with all its keys and power. Nothing will be more certain to build faith and testimonies of members and touch the hearts of honest seekers for the truth than this great book.

There is a special power about the Book of Mormon. It bears a strong, silent witness of its truth as one reads it.

Parley P. Pratt stated, ""The Spirit of the Lord came upon me, while I read [The Book of Mormon], and enlightened my mind, convinced my judgment, and rivetted the truth upon my understanding, so that I knew that the book was true, just as well as a man knows the daylight from the dark night."" (Journal of Discourses, 5:194.)

Brigham Young said as he read the book, ""I knew it was true, as well as I knew that I could see with my eyes, or feel by the touch of my fingers, or be sensible of the demonstration of any sense."" (JD, 3:91.)",3

Thus, some Nauvoo Masons thought of the Endowment as a restoration of a ritual only imperfectly preserved in Freemasonry and viewed Joseph Smith as a master of the underlying principles and allegorical symbolism (Heber C. Kimball to Parley P. Pratt, June 17, 1842, Church Archives). The philosophy and major tenets of Freemasonry are not fundamentally incompatible with the teaching, theology, and doctrines of the Latter-day Saints. Both emphasize morality, sacrifice, consecration, and service, and both condemn selfishness, sin, and greed. Furthermore, the aim of Masonic ritual is to instruct-to make truth available so that man can follow it.

Resemblances between the two rituals are limited to a small proportion of actions and words; indeed, some find that the LDS Endowment has more similarities with the Pyramid texts and the Coptic documents than with Freemasonry. Even where the two rituals share symbolism, the fabric of meanings is different. In addition to creation and life themes, one similarity is that both call for the participants to make covenants. Yet, the Endowment alone ties covenants to eternal blessings and to Jesus Christ. The Masonic ceremony does not emphasize priesthood or the need to be commissioned by God to represent him. The active participation of God in the world and in men's lives is a distinctly LDS temple motif. While Masons believe in an undefined, impersonal God, everything in the LDS Endowment emanates from, or is directed to, God who is a personage and man's eternal Father. The Endowment looks to the eternities and to eternal lives, but Freemasonry is earthbound, pervaded by human legend and hope for something better.",3

> *Joseph seems to have used Masonry as a point of departure, a beginning rather than an end in itself. Several scholars of differing degrees of belief in Joseph Smith's teachings have analyzed the evidence and arrived at this conclusion. Michael Homer argued that ""the rituals of Freemasonry provided a starting point for the Mormon prophet's revelation of 'true Masonry.'"" David Buerger argued that the pattern of resemblances was too great and the content of the endowment too unique to explain simply. ""Thus,"" he concluded, ""the temple ceremony cannot be explained as wholesale borrowing from Masonry; neither can it be explained as completely unrelated to Freemasonry."" Allen Roberts concluded that ""Joseph's Masonry was not a conventional one. He attempted to restore it in much the same way the gospel was restored. That is, he saw Masonry like Christianity, as possessing some important truths which could be beneficially extracted from what was otherwise an apostate institution.""*

So, here's what it all really boils down to: yes, there are some elements of Masonic ceremony in the endowment. But those elements link back at least to early Christianity, and some are far older than that. Additionally, those elements are small things, like signs, tokens, symbols, minor phrasing, and the fact that there's a ritual drama to teach us important lessons. They do not include the lessons themselves or the ordinances and covenants.",3

Kimball, a Mason himself and a member of the First Presidency for 21 years, made the following statement:",4,"And, as a matter of fact, there are many ancient Christian practices that are similar to Masonic ceremonies, such as the signs and symbols of the Catholic Liturgy. While I don't know if we can state it as verifiable fact, there is evidence that the early Christians had the endowment. Those early ceremonies, as well as ancient Hebrew temple ceremonies, have strong similarities to our endowment today, which points to there being some commonality. Long before he became a Mason, Joseph knew he would be allowed to restore very, very ancient ordinances, going back to the days of Adam. Even more than that, the Lord Himself declared that those ordinances, and the way in which they are performed, have existed since ""before the foundation of the world.""

With those symbols, ceremonies, and clothing being so old, is it any wonder that they may have become corrupted as they've been passed down by different apostate groups? Particularly after the Great Apostasy, when the authority to preach and administer those ordinances was taken away and there was no prophet to correct their usage, so people were left to their own memories and interpretations of them? And is it surprising at all that a secular fraternal organization with roots in medieval Christianity might use some version of those same symbols and ceremonies in its practice, despite not being religious in nature?

The abstract to a fantastic article in the Interpreter by Jeffrey Bradshaw states the following:

> *Joseph Smith taught that the origins of modern temple ordinances go back beyond the foundation of the world. * *Even for believers, the claim that rites known anciently have been restored through revelation raises complex questions because we know that revelation almost never occurs in a vacuum. Rather, it comes most often through reflection on the impressions of immediate experience, confirmed and elaborated through subsequent study and prayer. *",3

Modified over centuries, these rituals existed in some form among ancient Egyptians, Coptic Christians, Israelites, and Masons, and in the Catholic and Protestant liturgies. Common elements include the wearing of special clothing, ritualistic speech, the dramatization of archetypal themes, instruction, and the use of symbolic gestures. One theme common to many-found in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the Egyptian pyramid texts, and Coptic prayer circles, for example-is man's journey through life and his quest, following death, to successfully pass the sentinels guarding the entrance to eternal bliss with the gods. Though these ceremonies vary greatly, significant common points raise the possibility of a common remote source.

The Egyptian pyramid texts, for example, feature six main themes: (1) emphasis on a primordial written document behind the rites; (2) purification (including anointing, lustration, and clothing); (3) the Creation (resurrection and awakening texts); (4) the garden (including tree and ritual meal motifs); (5) travel (protection, a ferryman, and Osirian texts); and (6) ascension (including victory, coronation, admission to heavenly company, and Horus texts). Like such ancient ceremonies, the LDS temple Endowment presents aspects of these themes in figurative terms. It, too, presents, not a picture of immediate reality, but a model setting forth the pattern of human life on earth and the divine plan of which it is part.

Masonic ceremonies are also allegorical, depicting life's states-youth, manhood, and old age-each with its associated burdens and challenges, followed by death and hoped-for immortality. There is no universal agreement concerning when Freemasonry began. Some historians trace the order's origin to Solomon, Enoch, or even Adam. Others argue that while some Masonic symbolism may be ancient, as an institution it began in the Middle Ages or later.",3

The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have often asked the Lord if there are better ways to take the blessings of the temple to His faithful children. We seek guidance regularly on how to ensure worldwide accuracy and consistency of temple instruction, covenants, and ordinances despite differences in language and culture.

Under the Lord's direction and in answer to our prayers, recent procedural adjustments have been made. *He* is the One who wants you to understand with great clarity exactly what you are making covenants to do. *He* is the One who wants you to experience fully *His* sacred ordinances. *He* wants you to comprehend your privileges, promises, and responsibilities. *He* wants you to have spiritual insights and awakenings you've never had before.

Temples have been part of *this* dispensation from its earliest days.8 Elijah committed the keys of sealing authority to Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple. The fulness of the priesthood was restored in the Nauvoo Temple.9

Until his martyrdom, Joseph Smith continued to receive revelations that furthered the restoration of the endowment and sealing ordinances.10 He recognized, however, that further refinement was needed. After administering the endowment to Brigham Young in May 1842, Joseph told Brigham, ""This is not arranged right, but we have done the best we could under the circumstances in which we are placed, and I wish you to take this matter in hand and organize and systematize all these ceremonies.""11

Following the Prophet's death, President Young oversaw the completion of the Nauvoo Temple12 and later built temples in the Utah Territory. At the dedication of the lower stories of the St. George Temple, Brigham Young vigorously declared the urgency of vicarious temple work when he said, ""When I think upon this subject, I want the tongues of seven thunders to wake up the people.""13",1

Therefore these are all examples of a Christian legacy.""*

There were statements given by Joseph prior to 1842 regarding the endowment as well as mentions of ancient symbols and tokens that have associations with Freemasonry. As Brian Hales states, ""Freemasonry in Nauvoo offers too little, too late to serve as the starting point and principal source of inspiration for the major doctrines and teachings relating to priesthood and temple ordinances. … Given Joseph Smith's reluctance to share the details of the most sacred events and doctrines publicly, it is certainly possible he received specific knowledge about some temple matters even earlier than can be now documented. These matters include: 1) the narrative backbone, clothing, and covenants of the modern temple endowment, especially as described in the book of Moses (1830-1831); 2) the sequence of blessings of the oath and covenant of the priesthood described in D&C 84 (1832); and 3) priesthood keys and symbols expressed in keywords, names, signs, and tokens (from 1829).**""**

Matthew Brown elaborates on this in his book. There's an entire chapter devoted to the evidences and symbols of the endowment that preceded Joseph's becoming a Mason, which reads, in part:

> *The theory that Joseph Smith took ritual elements from the Freemasons in order to create the LDS temple ceremony is principally founded upon the concept of time. Supporters of this theory argue that since the Prophet joined the Masonic fraternity shortly before he introduced the Nauvoo endowment among the Saints—and because there are similarities between the two sets of ceremonies—the leader of the Mormons must have been guilty of unacknowledged borrowing from the Masons.*

Is it really that surprising that He might inspire Joseph to do the same thing when trying to teach the endowment to the Saints? Because it seems like Joseph was using those Masonic elements to teach eternal principles to the Saints who were already familiar with those ceremonies.

Jeffrey Bradshaw explains:

> *Evidence suggests that Joseph Smith encouraged Nauvoo Masonry at least in part to help those who would later receive temple ordinances. For instance, Joseph Fielding, an endowed member of the Church who joined Freemasonry in Nauvoo, said: ""Many have joined the Masonic institution. This seems to have been a stepping stone or preparation for something else, the true origin of Masonry"" — i.e., in ancient priesthood ordinances.*

> *One aspect of this preparation apparently had to do with the general idea of respecting covenants of confidentiality. For example, Joseph Smith once told the Saints that ""the reason we do not have the secrets of the Lord revealed unto us is because we do not keep them.""

Its influence could be felt in diverse areas ranging from art and architecture to social and institutional practices. Importantly, Joseph Smith's exposure to Masonic ritual was no doubt a spur to further revelation as the Nauvoo temple ordinances took shape under his prophetic authority. But whatever suggestions may have come to Joseph Smith through his experience with Masonry, what he did with those suggestions through his prophetic gifts was seen by the Saints as transformative, not merely derivative.*

The ""link,"" then, would not be a passed-down line of authority but one of similar ideas, many of which the Masons undoubtedly got wrong but a few, apparently, they got right.

Although more a Church folklore, with origins from comments made by early Mormon Masons such as Heber C. Kimball, than being Church doctrine, it's a myth that the endowment ceremony has its origins from Solomon's temple or that Freemasonry passed down parts of the endowment over the centuries from Solomon's temple.

The Church makes no attempt to claim that either Freemasonry or the endowment claim their authority from being ""passed down"" in an unbroken chain from Solomon's temple.",3

Nobody ever claimed that Masonry had the original temple ceremony. Jeremy's second point, which we discussed in part last week, involved a quote from Heber C. Kimball that said, ""We have the true Masonry. The Masonry of today is received from the apostasy which took place in the days of Solomon and David. They have now and then a thing that is correct, but we have the real thing.""

Heber said the Masons were already in apostasy during the days of Solomon and David, and that they had a few things that were similar to the temple ordinances, but that the Saints had the real ordinances. Because the people were already in apostasy, the Masons never had the real temple ordinances. There's nothing to suggest that the oldest form of Masonry we know of was any more religiously correct than today's organization. The Masons are a secular organization. Their rituals and ceremonies have nothing to do with exaltation.

Jeffrey Bradshaw explains:

… [A]lthough Freemasonry is not a religion and, in contrast to Latter-day Saint temple ordinances, does not claim saving power for its rites, threads relating to biblical themes of exaltation are evident in some Masonic rituals. For example, in the ceremonies of the Royal Arch degree of the York rite, candidates pass through a series of veils and eventually enter into the divine presence. In addition, Christian interpretations, like Salem Town's description of the ""eighth degree,"" tell of how the righteous will ""be admitted within the veil of God's presence, where they will become kings and priests before the throne of his glory for ever and ever."" Such language echoes New Testament teachings. Thus, apart from specific ritual language, forms, and symbols, a more general form of resemblance between Mormon temple ritual and certain Masonic degrees might be seen in the views they share about the ultimate potential of humankind.",3

So do many of the symbols and tokens we learn inside the temple.

Brian Hales states, ""Christians with antiquarian interests incorporated and developed selected aspects of ancient rituals as early Freemasonry took shape. Though Old Testament themes are pervasive in Masonic ritual, it seems clear that they come by way of Christian tradition.""

We traced some of that history last week. We know that Joseph was aware that he was restoring something far more ancient than Freemasonry when he restored the endowment, and that much of his knowledge came prior to his induction into the organization. Jeffrey Bradshaw and K-Lynn Paul went through a lot of the early history prior to 1836 in this fantastic paper written for the Interpreter.

So, despite Jeremy's assertion here, the claims were not that Joseph was restoring Freemasonry to its original state or that the Masons had the original endowment. It was that the Masons, even if you actually could trace their history back to the days of Solomon's temple, had a corrupted version of the endowment right from the beginning. Whether it was more, less, or equally corrupt in Joseph's day as in Solomon and David's day is anybody's guess.",2

This concept goes pretty much hand-in-hand with the one above. It was a common belief during the 19th Century that Freemasonry was a guild of people who originally descended from the Stonemasons that built Solomon's temple, and who had preserved some of the secret temple rites and teachings that had been lost or altered over the centuries. Many early Latter-day Saints made comments stating their belief that Freemasonry was a corrupted form of ancient Priesthood ordinances and temple rites, as you can see at the cited link.

We know now that the bit about descending from Solomon's temple isn't accurate and Masonry dates back to the Middles Ages in the British Isles, but even today, there are some sects of Masonry who publicly point to those old legends about that temple as a teaching aid.",3

Well, yes and no. So certainly there are a lot of parallels, and so the question we have to ask ourselves is, ""How did those parallels get there?"" And we don't know the full answer. There are several possibilities, and my guess is it's a little bit of all of those. So the idea that they are imitating true temple ordinances and rituals from the earliest days, that idea comes from a text in the book of Abraham where it talks about Pharaoh, who's a good man, and wants to have the rights of the priesthood, but he can't have it, so he imitates it. So that's a possibility. It's also—we know as members of the Church that the Abrahamic Covenant and rituals have been around since Adam down to Noah, and at one point everyone knew about these. So we should expect to see corrupted echoes of true rituals not just in Egyptian culture, but in every ancient culture. I mean, we should expect to see that, because they all came from an original source, and so that's one reason why we may see some of these parallels. In general mankind wants to interact with the heavens, and temples and rituals help us do that, so there should be some commonalities. There's also another interesting thing: We know that the Masons were intentionally borrowing from Egyptian symbolism, and we know that Joseph Smith, when he was trying to figure out—he had the theology and the inspiration of what the endowment and temple rituals were supposed to be like, but as he's trying to find ways to actually put that into action, he was influenced by the Masons. So there's probably an indirect reason also for some similarities with Egyptian temples, and my guess would be that all of those, everything I just said, in one way or another, impacts what's going on. So again, it's complex. See how this works?",3

> *It requires a logical leap to bridge the evidentiary gap between similarity, which was obvious to those who knew both Masonry and the endowment, and dependence, which is assumed—not known. Some people reason that Joseph Smith initiated men and women into the endowment ordinances after he was initiated into Freemasonry; therefore, the temple rituals derived from Masonry. One problem in this theory is that Freemasonry itself borrowed much of its ritual and ceremony from elements preserved since antiquity. There is ample similarity and difference not only between Freemasonry and LDS temple ordinances, but in many other ancient and more modern stories and rituals as well. Disentangling the complex relationships between them is not possible and should not be oversimplified.*
>
>
> *It is possible to discern differences in the functions (however similar in form) of Masonic and LDS temple ordinances. Masonic rituals use aprons, door-knockings, and unusual handshakes to foster brotherhood. Bonds are made between men, not between people and God. LDS temple ordinances endow believers with power to regain the presence of God as they make and keep covenants with him. The ritual is not the endowment of power itself. It may be that some ritual forms were adapted from Masonic traditions, but the endowment teaches a divine plan of creation, Fall, and redemption through Christ—promising those who covenant to keep God's laws that they will gain power over the effects of the Fall. As Heber Kimball was perfectly positioned to know, the endowment did not simply mimic Masonry.*

Even those places where actions are similar, they have completely different meanings. Joseph seems to have taken some of the actions and completely repurposed them. It is also interesting to note that the similar short phrases that are currently used are not critical phrases in the endowment ceremony. When the endowment ceremony was first performed in Nauvoo, it was much longer. As it has been shortened over the years, the Masonic-like phrases have been almost entirely removed.*

The first is the idea that Masonic signs and tokens, and sometimes even the signs and tokens of the temple, are hallmarks of a secret combination, which I have seen thrown around. The Freemasons are not a secret combination. The temple ordinances do not point toward their belonging to a secret combination, either. Satan loves to inspire counterfeits to the things of God. For example, Hiram Page's black seer stone as a counterfeit of Joseph's stone, or an unmarried couple living together as a counterfeit to marriage. Secret combinations are Satan's counterfeit of God's ordinances, and the signs and tokens of a secret combination are a gross distortion of the signs and tokens associated with a temple covenant.",3

While the Temple Endowment and Masonic rituals have some outward similarities (just as the Nazi swastika comes from an older religious Sanskrit symbol), those similarities don't extend to the meaning of the rituals. The ritual is the wrapping paper; it is how the gift is presented to us. Familiarity helps convey messages and improves remembrance. If the Gospel had been restored in a different country or a different time, undoubtedly different symbols would have been employed.

Most of the important temple doctrines had already been revealed to Joseph Smith prior to becoming a Mason. Masonry simply helped facilitate the symbols (dressings) which were utilized to teach those important principles and covenants.

* 72) If the temple endowment is a restoration of original Masonry, why doesn't it match earlier versions of Masonry?

* 73) Despite the claims made by some LDS leaders, Freemasonry has zero links to Solomon's Temple.

Answer: That's irrelevant. The meanings of the rituals are linked to early Christianity and were restored by revelation. The form of the rituals was drawn from symbols in the environment.

* 74) Is God really going to require people to know secret tokens, handshakes, and signs to get into the Celestial Kingdom?

Answer: The Gospel is a plan to change people into beings who desire and can experience everlasting joy. It's about turning one's heart and faith over to the Lord and losing one's self in the service and love of others (just as God does for us). God wants all of His children to reach that plane of eternal joy and will give everyone the opportunity to decide for themselves if that's really what they want.

As Brian Hales explains, ""Freemasonry in Nauvoo offers too little, too late to serve as the starting point and principal source of inspiration for the major doctrines and teachings relating to priesthood and temple ordinances. … Given Joseph Smith's reluctance to share the details of the most sacred events and doctrines publicly, it is certainly possible he received specific knowledge about some temple matters even earlier than can be now documented. These matters include: 1) the narrative backbone, clothing, and covenants of the modern temple endowment, especially as described in the book of Moses (1830-1831); 2) the sequence of blessings of the oath and covenant of the priesthood described in D&C 84 (1832); and 3) priesthood keys and symbols expressed in keywords, names, signs, and tokens (from 1829).""

Matthew Brown elaborates on all of this in his book:

*The theory that Joseph Smith took ritual elements from the Freemasons in order to create the LDS temple ceremony is principally founded upon the concept of time. Supporters of this theory argue that since the Prophet joined the Masonic fraternity shortly before he introduced the Nauvoo endowment among the Saints—and because there are similarities between the two sets of ceremonies—the leader of the Mormons must have been guilty of unacknowledged borrowing from the Masons….*",3

> *Freemasonry has zero links to the Solomon's temple. Although more a Church folklore, with origins from comments made by early Mormon Masons such as Heber C. Kimball, than being Church doctrine, it's a myth that the endowment ceremony has its origins from Solomon's temple or that Freemasonry passed down parts of the endowment over the centuries from Solomon's temple. Solomon's temple was all about animal sacrifice. Freemasonry has its origins to stone tradesmen in medieval Europe – not in 950 BC Jerusalem.*

### FAIR's Response

#### Fact checking results: This claim is based upon correct information - The author is providing knowledge concerning some particular fact, subject, or event

 This is correct. Some circumstantial and disparate data has been marshaled before by many LDS and Mason scholars to try and link freemasonry to Solomon's temple and the original church of Christ, though nothing definitive has been put forth to date. The currently available historical data is simply to sparse to put anything plausible together.

If you're going to use this quote, you have a responsibility to at least use the whole sentence:

""It is clear that Freemasonry and its traditions played a role in the development of the endowment ritual but not the degree that Mr. Norton would like to suggest."" [Emphasis added.]

The whole paragraph is helpful, actually, as it's clear that Kearney is making a point directly opposite to the one you're trying to make with his words :

It is clear that Freemasonry and its traditions played a role in the development of the endowment ritual but not the degree that Mr. Norton would like to suggest. Further he also brings up only similarities not the differences between the two. For example the central story in the endowment is the allegory of Adam and Eve. In Masonry it is the story of the master builder of Solomon's temple Hiram Abiff. Whole vast sections of the Masonic ritual are not and have never been found in the temple endowment.

The simple fact is that no one ever received their endowment in a Masonic lodge and no one has ever been made a Mason in an LDS temple. As a LDS Freemason I find the similarities reassuring rather than disturbing.

If there's no connection to Solomon's temple, what's so divine about a man-made medieval European secret fraternity and its rituals?

I don't know of any prophet or apostle who has ever claimed Freemasonry is divine. If they did, we'd all be counseled to become Freemasons.

* 5. Why did the Church remove the blood oath penalties and the 5 Points of Fellowship at the veil from the endowment ceremony in 1990? Both of these were 100% Masonic rituals.

They were probably removed because both were 100% Masonic rituals and unnecessary.
What does this say about the Temple and the endowment ceremony if 100% pagan Masonic rituals were in it from its inception?",2

In the temple Endowment all covenants are between the individual and God. In Freemasonry, testing, grading, penalizing, or sentencing accords with the rules of the fraternity or membership votes. In the Endowment, God alone is the judge. Within Freemasonry, rank and promotions are of great importance, while in the LDS temple rites there are no distinctions: all participants stand equal before God. The clash between good and evil, including satan's role, is essential to, and vividly depicted in, the Endowment, but is largely absent from Masonic rites. Temple ceremonies emphasize salvation for the dead through vicarious ordinance work, such as baptism for the dead; nothing in Masonic ritual allows for proxies acting on behalf of the dead. Women participate in all aspects of LDS temple rites; though Freemasonry has women's auxiliaries, Masonic ritual excludes them. The Endowment's inclusion of females underscores perhaps the most fundamental difference between the two rites: LDS temple rites unite husbands and wives, and their children, in eternal families (see Eternal Lives, Eternal Increase; Marriage). Latter-day Saint sealings would be completely out of place in the context of Masonic ceremonies.

Thus, Latter-day Saints see their temple ordinances as fundamentally different from Masonic and other rituals and think of similarities as remnants from an ancient original.",3

Each one is literally a house of the Lord—a place where He and His spirit may dwell, where He may come or send others to confer priesthood blessings and to give revelation to His people.

Temples built especially to the Lord have been erected in all ages. Moses built a tabernacle in the wilderness for the children of Israel. Solomon built a magnificent temple in Jerusalem. The Nephites built sacred temples. Joseph Smith built houses of the Lord in Kirtland and Nauvoo, and succeeding prophets have built temples throughout the world. These have all been initiated and built under the direction and revelation of God.

Without revelation, temples can neither be built nor properly used. They are one of the evidences of the divinity of our Lord's true gospel. In our day, the Lord has said: ""How shall your washings be acceptable unto me, except ye perform them in a house which you have built to my name? … that … ordinances might be revealed which had been hid from … the world.""

Can he speak to man? Is he concerned with individual human needs?""

A young man not unfamiliar with praying, and responding to his youthful faith, entered a grove and, looking around and finding himself alone, kneeled, and offered up the desires of his heart to God. The grove became exceedingly light, brighter than he had ever known. Before him stood two glorious personages—defying all description. One pointed to the other and said, *""This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!""* The Son spoke to the kneeling boy. Joseph was told that all the churches were wrong—they had corrupted the doctrine, had changed the ordinances, and had lost the authority of the priesthood—and that he, unlearned but humble, was to be the instrument through whom the Almighty would reestablish his work. (See JS—H 1:15–20).

The prevalent religious teachings of the world had reduced God, in the minds of people, to a fragile spirit, spread throughout the universe, nowhere yet everywhere present—nebulous theories and uncertain doctrine as to the personality of God and the Godhead. Truth had become perverted. When the boy prophet came out of the grove, he had no doubts—he knew. He had looked upon the Father and the Son. They had visited him and instructed him. In the Prophet's own words: ""I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it"" (JS—H 1:25).

Joseph now knew God is in the form of a man. He has a voice, he speaks, he is kind, he answers prayers. His Son is like the Father—but a separate and distinct person. Joseph learned the Son is obedient to the Father and mediator between God and man.

The Lord needed a man of steel, one fearless to withstand ridicule and social and political pressures, one like unto Moses, yet greater.

In due course the boy prophet had other angelic visitations.",2

As we briefly told of the Restoration and of Joseph Smith, his profile focused in my mind in a most interesting way. It was an unusual experience. As the Prophet's facial profile remained in my mind I thought: ""If these reporters and the world could only understand the entire story and the significance of the Restoration—of the eternal blessings God has made available to all. If they could only feel as I feel. If they could know, as I know, if they could only realize the calling and the role of the Prophet.""

I added my witness that Joseph Smith was divinely commissioned as the restorer of the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness, that he was and is a prophet of God, that he sought God in prayer and God spoke to him.

Other heavenly visitants—Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Moses, Elijah, Elias—each came in turn, and each bestowed the keys, powers, rights, and prerogatives which they themselves possessed anciently.

Joseph turned to the Bible for answers. ""If any of you lack wisdom,"" he read in the Epistle of James, ""let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.""5

""One of them spake … , calling [Joseph] by name and said, pointing to the other—*This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!*""6

Let us consider some of them. Perhaps most important is the concept of the Godhead. The New Testament clearly established that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are three separate and distinct beings, yet there are many in the Christian world who do not accept this or believe in a personal God in whose image we were created. The Father and the Son actually appeared personally to Joseph Smith to establish their personality and image. When the boy came out of that grove he knew the facts—that God is in form like a man. He speaks, he is considerate and kind, he answers prayer. He is a personal God for he called Joseph by name. His Son is a like and distinct person and is the Mediator between God and man.

The occurrence in the grove was a flat contradiction that revelation had ceased, that God no longer communicated with man. Old and New Testament scriptures repeatedly affirm the need for continuous revelation. Consider the words of Amos:

""Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets"" (Amos 3:7).

Following the revelations he received, Joseph Smith taught with authority many truths recorded in the Bible which previously had not been understood. Some of these are: that we are spirit children of God, that we had a premortal existence, that we are in mortality to prove ourselves, and that if we are faithful we can return to live eternally in the presence of God and through eternal progression become Godlike.",0

There's no reason to assume that only Joseph Smith is asking these questions or longing to know his relationship with and standing to God, and there's no reason to assume that God wouldn't answer others. Now, I don't know. I can't validate or verify whether these are actual experiences or not, but I don't doubt that they could be. And what I do notice, though, is that the idea of writing off Joseph's—the reality of his experience because there are other similar ones, it's bad logic. It's bad reasoning. It's a non sequitur, it does not follow. So if your first premise is there were lots of people—and there weren't lots. It was not terribly uncommon, but it also wasn't common, it's not 9 out of 10 people who are seeing the Father and the Son in the woods. It's one out of a who knows how many, but it's a small number, but probably enough that most people have heard of somebody, somewhere, in their recent past or lifetime that had an experience in their bedroom or in their law office or in the woods with a vision of some kind or other. So Joseph Smith's gets more concrete and more—he gets more emphatic over time as he describes it about the theological content of what happened. In other words, Joseph's vision leads, by his 1838-39 narration of it, to the establishment of the Church of Jesus Christ, and he—the more he's opposed by it and the more it goes counter to his culture, the more adamantly Joseph Smith affirms it.",1

The prophet Joel anticipated that visions would increase in the last days, saying, ""Old men shall dream dreams, [and] young men shall see visions"" (Joel 2:28-32).

The Prophet Joseph Smith had his first vision at the age of fourteen while praying in a grove of trees in western New York (see First Vision). The appearance of the Lord to him, like that to Saul of Tarsus, was attended by a shining light from heaven (Acts 9:3). The Lord spoke face-to-face with Joseph and called him to service. This was the first of a series of visions Joseph Smith received, many of which were shared with other persons. Blessed like John on the isle of Patmos and Paul who spoke of the third heavens, the Prophet Joseph Smith affirmed, ""Could you gaze into heaven five minutes, you would know more than you would by reading all that ever was written on the subject"" (*TPJS*, p. 324; cf. *HC* 6:50). He also declared that ""the best way to obtain truth and wisdom is not to ask it from books, but to go to God in prayer, and obtain divine teaching"" (*TPJS*, p. 191).",3

The answer was astonishing. As he prayed in the woods near his house, the Father and the Son appeared to him. Assuring him that his sins were forgiven, the Lord told him that none of the churches were right and that he should join none. Latter-day Saints call this Joseph Smith's first vision, the initial event in the restoration of the gospel. At the time, it made little impression on the people around Joseph Smith. He told a minister about the vision and was rebuffed. Believing the Bible sufficient, ministers were skeptical of direct revelation. The scorn upset Joseph, who had only tried to report his actual experience, and alienated him still further from the churches.

After three years with no further revelations, Joseph wondered if he still was in favor with God and prayed again for direction and forgiveness. The vision he received on September 21, 1823, set the course of his life for the next seven years. An angel appeared and instructed him about a sacred record of an ancient people. This angel, Moroni 2, told Joseph that he was to obtain the record, written on gold plates, and translate it. He also told him that God's covenant with ancient Israel was about to be fulfilled, that preparation for the second coming of Christ was about to commence, and that the gospel was to be preached to all nations to prepare a people for Christ's millennial reign. In a vision Joseph saw the hill near his home where the plates were buried. When he went the next day to get the plates, the angel stopped him. He was told that he must wait four years to obtain the plates and that, until then, he was to return each year for instructions. On September 22, 1827, he obtained the plates from which he translated the Book of Mormon (see Moroni, Visitations of).",3

""While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside. …

""He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God … and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people"" (Joseph Smith—History 1:30, 33).

The boy must have been stunned by what he heard. In the eyes of those who knew him, he was simply a poor, unlearned farm boy. He had no wealth. His neighbors were in the same condition.

It is the event that kicks off the entire story. But that's not necessarily the way Joseph Smith thought of it, and it's definitely not the way he presented it to the early Saints. He didn't. He presented to them being called of God when the angel Moroni came and called him to the work, right? God has a work for you to do, Moroni said. And Joseph being called to the work in his narrative starts with that. And that's how Mother Smith tells the story as well. So early saints didn't necessarily even know there was a First Vision. We might think that's impossible, or if there was a First Vision, he certainly would have told them, if there was a First Vision, they would have all known about it. Those are nothing but hypothetical assumptions. Zero historical evidence behind them. You can't use them to disprove the vision. All you're disproving is what you think should have happened if history happened the way you imagine it happened.

Scott Woodward:

Yeah. So when does he start feeling more confident to tell the story? We know we don't have a record of all the details, but we do have people mentioning that he had told it, and he seems to have, you know—people want him to tell the story again. Doesn't W. W. Phelps say, like, we asked him to tell that story again about the Beloved Son?",0

But it more than strains the historical record to assume that, during his teenage and early adult years, Joseph Smith was somehow secretly developing the Book of Mormon. Someone at some point would surely have noticed if he was spending any significant amount of time reading or writing in preparation for his translation.16: 13. "") Yet there is no such reliable report from anyone inside or outside of Joseph's family.

Moreover, the destitute circumstances of the Smith family required long hours of ""continuous labor"" from all who were capable of work (Joseph Smith—History 1:55). As Rees has argued, the notion that ""Joseph had time to read broadly, undertake research, construct various drafts, and work out the plot, characters, settings, various points of view, and multiple rhetorical styles that constitute the five-hundred-plus page narrative of the Book of Mormon is simply incredible (in its original Latin sense of 'not worthy of belief').""17

With these circumstances in mind, we can more clearly understand why the Lord himself, through the voice of the prophet Isaiah, referred to the coming forth of the Book of Mormon as a ""marvelous work and a wonder"" (2 Nephi 27:26), and then set about to see that this prophetic description was fulfilled.",2

""If any of you lack wisdom, let him [or her] ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally … ; and it shall be given him.

""But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.""14

Believing those prophetic words and with unwavering, childlike faith, Joseph went to a grove of trees near his home and there knelt and prayed. Later he recorded:

""I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head. …

""… When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air.""15

Looking up at these two beings, even Joseph could not have known who They were—for he had not yet witnessed and learned the true nature of God and Christ. But then, he records, ""one of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—*This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!*""16

From that singular experience and others, the Prophet Joseph bore witness, ""The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also.""17",3

Brother Hamstead replied, ""Ah, but if you take away the angel appearing to the Prophet Joseph, then I couldn't belong to the Church because that is its foundation.""2

Like the professor at London University, many people see the sheer wonder of this Church and are persuaded that it has great merit and substance. They appreciate what the Church can do for its believers. However, they lack the spiritual confirmation that Joseph Smith actually saw in vision the Father and the Son and that an angel delivered to Joseph Smith the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated. Coming to know God is the principal spiritual gift that can come to any man or woman. Joseph Smith received this knowledge of God firsthand. Many years later, still pondering the impact of that and other happenings in his life, Joseph himself said: ""I don't blame any one for not believing my history. If I had not experienced what I have, I would not have believed it myself.""3

Joseph Smith was quite young when he received these revelations. Most of them came before he was 30 years old.12 He lacked experience, and to some people, he probably seemed underqualified to be the Lord's prophet.

He wanted to know which church was right.10 Inspired by these words in the Bible, ""If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God,""11 he acted for himself to find an answer. On a beautiful morning in the spring of 1820, he entered a grove of trees and knelt in prayer. Because of his faith and because God had a special work for him to do, Joseph received a glorious vision of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, and learned for himself what he was to do.

Do you see in Joseph's experience a pattern you could apply in gaining or strengthening your own testimony? Joseph allowed the scriptures to penetrate his heart. He pondered them deeply and applied them to his own situation. He then acted on what he had learned. The result was the glorious First Vision—and everything that came after it.

He chose a young man named Joseph Smith to learn about the eternal plan of salvation. Joseph was confused about the different religions in his community, but the scriptures led him to ask God what he should do.7 In answer to his prayer, God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him.8 Through this and other experiences, Joseph Smith was called as a prophet, like unto Moses and other biblical prophets.9 Because Joseph saw and talked with the Savior, his work was to restore the truth about the great plan of God and the divine mission of our Lord. I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.

The Prophet Joseph received authority to teach the gospel and bring forth additional scripture. He was commanded to translate writings of ancient prophets from The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. The Book of Mormon prophets also knew about the plan of salvation and the sacred mission of Jesus Christ. The appearance of the resurrected Christ to the ancient people of the Americas is recorded in this sacred book.10 He taught them His gospel and established His Church among them. I know that the Book of Mormon is another testament of the divinity of Jesus Christ.

God has promised that the Holy Ghost will testify to each of us that sacred truths have been restored and that Joseph Smith was called by God to be a special witness of Christ and His gospel. We may come to know the truth of all things God has revealed, through the power of the Holy Ghost.11

Millions of converts to this Church initially accepted the truths proclaimed by our missionaries in the first discussion.

""… When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—*This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!*""9

Joseph Smith saw God, the Eternal Father, and Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of the world. This was Joseph's *First* Vision. In the years that followed, Joseph translated the Book of Mormon by the gift and power of God. Numerous other heavenly beings visited him, restoring truths and authority that had been lost for centuries. These divine communications to Joseph Smith opened the windows of heaven and the glories of eternity to our view. Joseph's life stands as a testimony that if any of us lack wisdom, we can ask God in faith and receive answers—sometimes from heavenly beings but more often by the power of the Holy Ghost, who speaks to us through inspired thoughts and feelings.10 It is through the Holy Ghost that we can ""know the truth of all things.""11

For many of us, a witness of the Prophet Joseph Smith begins as we read the Book of Mormon. I first read the Book of Mormon from cover to cover as a young early-morning seminary student. With my vivid boyish imagination, I decided to read as if I were Joseph Smith, discovering the truths in the Book of Mormon for the very first time.

Good men and women, not a few—really great and wonderful people—tried to correct, strengthen, and improve their systems of worship and their body of doctrine. To them I pay honor and respect. How much better the world is because of their bold action. While I believe their work was inspired, it was not favored with the opening of the heavens, with the appearance of Deity. Then in 1820 came that glorious manifestation in answer to the prayer of a boy who had read in his family Bible the words of James: ""If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him"" (James 1:5).

Prophets and apostles throughout the history of mankind have had divine manifestations similar to Joseph's. Moses saw God face-to-face and learned that he was a son of God ""in the similitude of [His] Only Begotten"" (see Moses 1:1–6). The Apostle Paul testified that the resurrected Jesus Christ appeared to him on the road to Damascus and made Paul one of His great missionaries (see Acts 26:9–23). Hearing Paul's witness of his heavenly vision during the trial at Caesarea, the powerful King Agrippa admitted, ""Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian"" (Acts 26:28).

And there were many other ancient prophets who also bore powerful testimony of Christ. All of these manifestations, ancient and modern, lead those who believe to the divine source of all righteousness and hope—to God, our Heavenly Father, and to His Son, Jesus Christ.",2

He was 14 years of age when he read in the book of James: ""If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him"" (James 1:5).

Desiring wisdom, because various creeds each claimed to have the truth, young Joseph determined to go into the woods and pray to the Lord.

This he did, and he experienced a vision in response to his prayer. God the Eternal Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, the Resurrected Lord, appeared before him and spoke with him.

Other manifestations followed. Among these was securing from a hill near his home golden plates which he translated by the gift and power of God.

Heavenly messengers appeared to him, bestowing upon him keys of the priesthood and the authority to speak in the name of God.

How could anyone believe such a story? It seemed preposterous. And yet these people believed as they were instructed. Faith came into their hearts to accept that which they had been taught. It was a miracle. It was a gift from God. They could not believe it, and yet they did.",3

What followed made his experience the most important event that had transpired in nearly 1,800 years. God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to him in person—face to face.

Subsequently, through this young man, whose name was Joseph Smith, God restored his church and the fulness of his gospel.

This restoration is what made that experience so important. I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ that this is true. I know that he talked with God and that there was such a restoration because the Holy Spirit has borne witness of it to me. I say it without the slightest hesitation. I have a sure conviction that it happened.",3

While this may be relatively unknown in the annals of history, yet it constituted an epochal event in the history of humanity—a profound demonstration of the love of God for all of His children. Because this milestone is of such importance, I would like to quote excerpts from the Prophet's written account:

""I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—*This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!*"" JS—H 1:17).

Joseph Smith encountered intense persecution after this experience had become public knowledge. He wrote:

""I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while [abusers] were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation"" (JS—H 1:25).

We regard that theophany—which we designate as the First Vision—and subsequent communications of heavenly beings with the Prophet Joseph Smith to be as real as my conversation with you now. These and other visitations relating to the promised restitution of the Church are well documented.",3

Our solemn testimony is that this angelic messenger appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith in the early nineteenth century. This announcement that an angel from God appeared to a prophet in our times is entirely consistent with the prophecies of the New Testament and should therefore command the interest of every earnest seeker after truth.

In light of the fact that Jesus said there would be both true and false prophets in the last days preceding His second coming, the central question is: ""Did Joseph Smith speak for God? Was he a true prophet?""

My intent today is to offer some evidences in support of Joseph Smith's mission as a prophet to this generation.

The most singular evidence in support of Joseph Smith's claim to being a spokesman for Almighty God was the publication of a scriptural record, the Book of Mormon.

The Book of Mormon is a record of the ancient inhabitants of the American continent and records the visit and ministry of Jesus Christ to the people on this continent following His ascension at Jerusalem. The major purpose of the record is to convince a later generation that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. The Book of Mormon, therefore, constitutes an additional witness, along with the Bible, to the divinity of Jesus Christ.

Joseph Smith obtained this ancient record from a heavenly messenger, just as John prophesied. This angel appeared to him and revealed the location of ancient records which were inscribed on metallic plates and buried in a stone vault. In due time, the young prophet was given the plates and the means by which they were translated. The book was then published to the world as canonized scripture.

Also, in harmony with the testimony of John, the book contains ""the everlasting gospel."" It is now preached by our missionaries to the world.",2

When Joseph Smith came on the scene, perhaps 100 pieces were in place. Then Joseph Smith came along and put many of the other 900 pieces in place so that people could say, ""Oh, now I understand where I came from, why I am here, and where I am going."" As for Joseph Smith's role in the Restoration, the Lord defined it clearly: ""This generation shall have my word through you"" (D&C 5:10).

In spite of this flood of restored biblical truths, some honest searchers have commented: ""I can accept these doctrines, but what about all those angels and visions Joseph Smith claimed to have? It seems so hard to believe in modern times.""

To those honest searchers, we lovingly respond: ""Were there not angels and visions in Christ's Church in New Testament times? Did not an angel appear to Mary and to Joseph? Did not angels appear to Peter, James, and John on the Mount of Transfiguration? Did not an angel rescue Peter and John from prison? Did not an angel appear to Cornelius, then to Paul before he was shipwrecked and to John on the Isle of Patmos? Did not Peter have a vision of the gospel going to the Gentiles, Paul a vision of the third heaven, John a vision of the latter days, and Stephen a vision of the Father and Son?""

Yes, Joseph Smith did see angels and visions—because he was the instrument in God's hands to restore the same Church of Jesus Christ as existed in primitive times—all of its powers as well as all of its doctrines.",2

He was born of noble, God-fearing parents who loved the Lord.

His paternal grandfather, Asael Smith, stated years before Joseph was born (and I quote):

""It has been borne in upon my soul that one of my descendants will promulgate a work to revolutionize the world of religious faith."" (in Joseph Fielding Smith, *Essentials in Church History,* Classics in Mormon Literature, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1979, p. 25.)

Joseph Smith said: ""Every man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the Grand Council of heaven before this world was. I suppose I was ordained to this very office in that Grand Council."" (*Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,* sel. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938, p. 365.)

I testify to you he *was* and he *is* a prophet of God and did restore the gospel of Jesus Christ in our day, together with the power and keys of authority to administer therein.

He spoke unto him from heaven and gave him commandments, and also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these things unto the whole world, and all this that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets: ""The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm of flesh—

He was the authorized servant of God. He fulfilled every requirement to complete the profile of a prophet. In due time Joseph received the ""keys of the kingdom."" With this apostolic power he reestablished the true church in its fullness and power. The Lord said to him: ""… this generation shall have my word through you."" (D&C 5:10.)

There is no greater prophet in any dispensation than Joseph Smith. He translated the Book of Mormon from ancient plates. Its purpose is to be another witness that Jesus is the Christ. Concerning this book, the Lord declared: ""And he has translated the book, even that part which I have commanded him, and as your Lord and your God liveth it is true."" (D&C 17:6.)

We know that it is not a popular thing to teach that a backwoods boy from Vermont, reared in New England and trained on the frontier, was a prophet. But, popular or not, it is a fact! *Joseph Smith was a prophet, and all of the calumny and aspersion to the contrary cannot controvert that fact.* Anyone who has concern for the welfare of his eternal soul should give attention to this message. Every man who has lived since the days of Joseph Smith is subject to accepting him as a prophet of God in order to enter into our Heavenly Father's presence.

If you do not know of the divine calling of Joseph Smith, perhaps it is because you have not considered it.

He reflects on them over and over again. The first glimmer of light penetrates the darkness. Is this the answer, the way out of confusion and darkness? Can it be this simple? Ask God and He will answer? At length he decides he must either ask God or ever remain in darkness and confusion.

And yet as anxious as he is, he doesn't run to a quiet corner and rattle off a hurried prayer. He is only 14, but in his haste to know, he is not hasty. This is not to be just any prayer. He decides where to go and when to make the attempt. He prepares to talk to God.

And then the day comes. It is ""the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of .""2 He walks alone into the stillness of the nearby woods, beneath the trees that tower above him. He reaches the place where he previously designed to go. He kneels and offers up the desires of his heart.

Our Father in Heaven loves all of His children equally, perfectly, and infinitely. His love is no different for His daughters than for His sons. Our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, also loves men and women equally. His atonement and His gospel are for all of God's children. During His earthly ministry Jesus served men and women alike: He healed both men and women and He taught both men and women.

The gospel of Jesus Christ can sanctify both men and women in the same way and by identical principles. For example, faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost are requirements for all of God's children, regardless of *gender.* The same is true of temple covenants and blessings. Our Father's work and glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of His children (see Moses 1:39). He loves us all equally, and His greatest gift, the gift of eternal life, is available to all.

Even though men and women are equal before God in their eternal opportunities, they have different, but equally significant, duties in His eternal plan. We must understand that God views all of His children with infinite wisdom and perfect fairness. Consequently, He can acknowledge and even encourage our differences while providing equal opportunity for growth and development.

Most people have inclinations of one kind or another at various times. If they do not act upon these inclinations, then they can go forward as do all other members of the Church.

I hasten to add that we deal only with those legislative matters which are of a strictly moral nature or which directly affect the welfare of the Church. We have opposed gambling and liquor and will continue to do so. We regard it as not only our right but our duty to oppose those forces which we feel undermine the moral fiber of society. Much of our effort, a very great deal of it, is in association with others whose interests are similar. We have worked with Jewish groups, Catholics, Muslims, Protestants, and those of no particular religious affiliation, in coalitions formed to advocate positions on vital moral issues. Such is currently the case in California, where Latter-day Saints are working as part of a coalition to safeguard traditional marriage from forces in our society which are attempting to redefine that sacred institution. God-sanctioned marriage between a man and a woman has been the basis of civilization for thousands of years. There is no justification to redefine what marriage is. Such is not our right, and those who try will find themselves answerable to God.

Some portray legalization of so-called same-sex marriage as a civil right. This is not a matter of civil rights; it is a matter of morality. Others question our constitutional right as a church to raise our voice on an issue that is of critical importance to the future of the family. We believe that defending this sacred institution by working to preserve traditional marriage lies clearly within our religious and constitutional prerogatives. Indeed, we are compelled by our doctrine to speak out.",0

Sisters, we know that the Church is made up of mortals, that priesthood leaders are fallible, and some may not always handle their stewardships with suitable sensitivity. However, I want you to understand this plain truth: the gospel of Jesus Christ provides the only way for women or men to achieve their full potential as children of God. Only the gospel can free us from the terrible effects of sin. Only by following God's plan for us, with faith and determination to live ultimately in eternal families, can we qualify for eternal life in His presence. Ideally, the Church and the family do not inhibit our progress. They expedite it by putting our feet firmly on the gospel path that leads us back to God. We each have the privilege to carefully and prayerfully seek the Lord's will for us regarding our individual challenges and dilemmas. *Personal* revelation is personal, indeed.

This Church of Jesus Christ opposes abortion and counsels all members *not* to submit to nor participate in any abortion, in any way, for convenience or to hide sins.

Abortion must be considered one of the most revolting and sinful practices in this day, when we are witnessing a frightening evidence of permissiveness leading to sexual immorality. We take the solemn view that any tampering with the fountains of life is serious, morally, mentally, psychologically, physically. To interfere with any of the processes in the procreation of offspring is to violate one of the most sacred of God's commandments—to ""multiply, and replenish the earth."" (Gen. 1:28.)

Members of the Church guilty of being parties to the sin of abortion must be subjected to the disciplinary action of the councils of the Church, as circumstances warrant. We remember the reiteration of the Ten Commandments given by the Lord in our own time, when he said, ""Thou shalt not steal; neither commit adultery, nor kill, nor do anything like unto it.""

Masturbation is not condoned but is not considered homosexual.

People who persist in committing acts that violate divine law are subject to Church disciplinary councils to help them understand the damage they are doing to their eternal well-being. Particularly offensive is any conduct that harms others, especially those who because of their youth are vulnerable to seduction or coercion. The eternal laws that pertain to chastity before marriage and personal purity within marriage apply to *all* sexual behavior. However, ""marriage is not doctrinal therapy for homosexual relations"" (Oaks, p. 10). The restored gospel of Jesus Christ exalts the relationship of husband and wife, as particularly illustrated in the temple ordinances. From these doctrines, covenants, and ordinances, it is clear that any sexual relationship other than that between a legally wedded heterosexual husband and wife is sinful. The divine mandate of marriage between man and woman puts in perspective why homosexual acts are offensive to God. They repudiate the gift and the Giver of eternal life.

Recognizing that failure to keep the covenants of the gospel of Jesus Christ deprives a person of God's blessings, the Church offers counseling to help those who are troubled by homosexual thoughts or actions to learn to use their agency to live in accord with divine laws and thereby enjoy the rich blessings a benevolent Father offers to all his children, whatever their temptation or thoughts. ""That has been the message of the Jewish and Christian prophets in all ages: repent. Abandon your sins; confess them; forsake them. And become acceptable to God"" (Oaks, p. 7).",3

***Some are lost because they have strayed.*** Except for the Lord, we have all made mistakes. The question is not whether we will trip and fall but, rather, how will we respond? Some, after making mistakes, stray from the fold. This is unfortunate. Do you not know that the Church is a place for imperfect people to gather together—even with all their mortal frailties—and become better? Every Sunday in every meetinghouse throughout the world, we find mortal, imperfect men, women, and children who meet together in brotherhood and charity, striving to become better people, to learn of the Spirit, and to lend encouragement and support to others. I am not aware of any sign on the door of our meetinghouses that reads ""Restricted Entrance—Perfect People Only.""

Because of our imperfections, we need the Lord's Church. It is there that His redemptive doctrines are taught and His saving ordinances are administered. The Church encourages and motivates us to be a better and happier people. It is also a place where we can lose ourselves in the service of others.

The Lord knows we will make mistakes. That is why He suffered for our sins. He wants us to get back on our feet and strive to do better. There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.

To you who have strayed because you have been offended, can you not set your hurt and anger aside? Can you not fill your hearts with love? There is a place for you here. Come, join the fold, consecrate your abilities, talents, and skills. You will be better for it, and others will be blessed by your example.

Despite the many challenges of great growth there are indications of increased faith over much of the earth. For instance, never in the history of the world have so many temples been built.

I do not believe this work will be stopped or seriously injured by its detractors. There are many prophetic statements to the contrary. History has proven quite conclusively that the Church has grown under persecution; it has prospered under criticism. By finding fault with the doctrines, practices, or the leadership of the Church, one can waste much time and effort in a fruitless endeavor. Those who have been washed in the waters of baptism put their eternal soul at risk by carelessly pursuing only the secular source of learning.

We know that the relationships, identities, and functions of men and women are essential to accomplish God's great plan.

Therefore, we must teach and contend for principles and practices that provide the best conditions for the development and happiness of children—all children.

Opposition is part of the plan, and Satan's most strenuous opposition is directed at whatever is most important to God's plan. He seeks to destroy God's work.

In the political arena, where competing claims to civil rights are frequently debated, the Church participates indirectly by encouraging members to vote and to foster a society congenial to Christian teaching and righteous living. Occasionally, when public issues implicate important matters of doctrine and morals, the Church publishes recommended positions on disputed issues and encourages members and others to follow their counsel. Thus, the Church has urged restrictions on the sale of alcoholic beverages, opposed the legalization of gambling and lotteries, favored right-to-work legislation (no closed or union shop), advocated the defeat of the equal rights amendment (ERA), and spoken out against pornography, abortion, and child abuse.",0

The Lord has proclaimed that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and is intended to be an eternal relationship bonded by trust and fidelity. Latter-day Saints, of all people, should marry with this sacred objective in mind. Marriage should not be viewed as a therapeutic step to solve problems such as homosexual inclinations or practices, which first should clearly be overcome with a firm and fixed determination never to slip to such practices again.

Having said this, I desire now to say with emphasis that our concern for the bitter fruit of sin is coupled with Christlike sympathy for its victims, innocent or culpable. We advocate the example of the Lord, who condemned the sin, yet loved the sinner. We should reach out with kindness and comfort to the afflicted, ministering to their needs and assisting them with their problems. We repeat, however, that the way of safety and the road to happiness lie in abstinence before marriage and fidelity following marriage. Declared the Lord in this dispensation: ""Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly"" (D&C 121:45). There follows a remarkable and wonderful promise: ""Then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God. …

""The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion"" (D&C 121:45–46).

Now, in conclusion, this leads to a related matter I wish to mention, and that is the sexual adventurism which is spreading like another plague across the world.",3

I have developed a deeper gratitude for the gospel, a broader affection and admiration for the members, and a greater appreciation for the love our Heavenly Father and his Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, have for each one of us. They have shown us the way to be at peace with ourselves and the way to progress and develop.

I have appreciated the privilege of associating regularly with the Brethren of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and with the other General Authorities. These great leaders, whom the Lord has called to direct his work, have a pure love for the people. They are compassionate and sensitive, especially to those who are ill, infirm, or less fortunate. They feel a driving urgency to build the kingdom of God, and they devote their time and energy totally to this work. Their prayers, which truly are expressions of gratitude and sacred pleadings for guidance, are a source of inspiration to me. I testify to you that the Spirit of the Lord is present at our meetings and guides our deliberations.

Being members of the Church truly is a privilege and an honor. We must be as Paul the Apostle and never be ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see Rom. 1:16) nor feel threatened when the Church, its leaders, its members, or its doctrines are criticized or maligned. On the contrary, we should be bold and assertive in proclaiming the gospel. We should be grateful to participate in this great latter-day movement.",0

On the contrary, our peculiarity and the uniqueness of the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ are indispensable elements in offering the people of the world a clear choice. Neither am I suggesting that we should associate in any relationship that would place us or our families at spiritual risk.

""This past year some of my friends on Facebook began posting their position on marriage. Many favored same-sex marriage, and several LDS youth indicated they 'liked' the postings. I made no comment.

""I decided to declare my belief in traditional marriage in a thoughtful way.

""With my profile picture, I added the caption 'I believe in marriage between a man and a woman.' Almost instantly I started receiving messages. 'You are selfish.' 'You are judgmental.' One compared me to a slave owner. And I received this post from a great friend who is a strong member of the Church: 'You need to catch up with the times. Things are changing and so should you.'

""I did not fight back,"" she said, ""but I did not take my statement down.""

She concludes: ""Sometimes, as President Monson said, 'You have to stand alone.' Hopefully as youth, we will stand together in being true to God and to the teachings of His living prophets.""11

Of special concern to us should be those who struggle with same-sex attraction. It is a whirlwind of enormous velocity. I want to express my love and admiration for those who courageously confront this trial of faith and stay true to the commandments of God But everyone, independent of his or her decisions and beliefs, deserves our kindness and consideration.13

The Savior taught us to love not only our friends but also those who disagree with us—and even those who repudiate us. He said: ""For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? … And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others?""14

The Prophet Joseph Smith warned us to ""beware of self-righteousness"" and to enlarge our hearts toward all men and women until we feel ""to take them upon our shoulders.""15 In the gospel of Jesus Christ, there is no place for ridicule, bullying, or bigotry.",3

They wrest the scriptures attempting to prove that these impulses are inborn, cannot be overcome, and should not be resisted; and therefore, such conduct has a morality of its own. They quote scriptures to justify perverted acts between consenting adults. That same logic would justify incest or the molesting of little children of either gender. Neither the letter nor the spirit of moral law condones any such conduct.

I hope none of our young people will be foolish enough to accept those sources as authority for what the scriptures mean. Paul, speaking on this very subject, condemned those ""who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator."" (Rom. 1:25.) In that same reference the word *covenantbreakers* is used for the only time in scripture. (See Rom. 1:31.)

Some choose to reject the scriptures out of hand and forsake their covenants. But they cannot choose to avoid the consequences. That choice is not theirs or ours or anybody's.

All of us are subject to feelings and impulses. Some are worthy and some of them are not; some of them are natural and some of them are not. We are to control them, meaning we are to direct them according to the moral law.

The legitimate union of the sexes is a law of God. The sacred covenants made by husband and wife with God protect the worthy expression of those feelings and impulses which are vital to the continuation of the race and essential to a happy family life.

To members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Book of Mormon forms the doctrinal foundation of the Church and speaks the word of God to all the world.

The Book of Mormon both confirms and supplements the Bible: ""Behold, this [the Book of Mormon] is written for the intent that ye may believe that [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe [the Book of Mormon] also"" (Morm. 7:9). The Bible is primarily a record of God's dealings with the forebears and descendants of Jacob or Israel in the ancient Near East. Latter-day Saints believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of God's dealings principally with another group of Israelites he brought to the Western Hemisphere from Jerusalem about 600 B.C. (see Lehi). They anticipated the birth and coming of Jesus Christ and believed in his Atonement and gospel. Their complex, lengthy records were abridged by a prophet named Mormon, inscribed on plates of gold, and buried by his son, Moroni 2, after internecine wars destroyed all of the believers in Christ in the New World except Moroni (A.D. 385).",3

Have you ever wondered why there are so many Christian churches in the world today when they obtain their doctrines from essentially the same Bible? It is because they interpret the Bible differently. If they interpreted it the same, they would be the same church. This is not a condition the Lord desires, for the Apostle Paul declared that there is ""one Lord, one faith, one baptism"" (Ephesians 4:5). To help bring this oneness about, the Lord established a divine law of witnesses. Paul taught, ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Corinthians 13:1).

The Bible is one witness of Jesus Christ; the Book of Mormon is another. Why is this second witness so crucial? The following illustration may help: How many straight lines can you draw through a single point on a piece of paper? The answer is infinite. For a moment, suppose that single point represents the Bible and that hundreds of those straight lines drawn through that point represent different interpretations of the Bible and that each of those interpretations represents a different church.

What happens, however, if on that piece of paper there is a second point representing the Book of Mormon? How many straight lines could you draw between these two reference points: the Bible and the Book of Mormon? Only one. Only one interpretation of Christ's doctrines survives the testimony of these two witnesses.",3

It gives an account of Christ's visit to the people of this continent. It corroborates and complements the Bible. It establishes the truth of the Bible. The central theme of the Book of Mormon concerns Jesus Christ and his mission. It is for the convincing of the Jews and the gentiles that Jesus is the Christ.

The Book of Mormon is a prophetic book. Its coming forth fulfills many biblical prophecies.

The Book of Mormon was given to the world with the admonition that man should test its authenticity by reading it and asking God if it is true. Before concluding the record of the Nephites, Moroni, the last surviving prophet of these people, wrote to those who would read the record in the latter days:

""When ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.""

The central event in the Book of Mormon is the appearance of the resurrected Christ to righteous inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere after his ascension into heaven at Jerusalem. During his visit, Christ delivered a sermon that is similar to the Sermon on the Mount recorded in the New Testament, but with certain vital clarifications and additions. He declared his doctrine, the fulness of his gospel necessary to enter the kingdom of God; and he established his Church with its essential ordinances, and ordained disciples to preside over the Church. At this time, Christ also explained the promises of God to Israel; healed the sick and disabled; blessed the children and their parents; and expressed his great love, allowing each individual to come forward and touch the wounds he had received during his crucifixion (see 3 Ne. 11-26).

That is why the prophet Mormon declared, ""Ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ"" (Moroni 7:41).

No wonder the Book of Mormon proclaims with boldness, ""And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ"" (2 Nephi 33:10).

Interesting as these matters may be, study of the Book of Mormon is most rewarding when one focuses on its *primary* purpose—to testify of Jesus Christ. By comparison, all other issues are incidental.

When you read the Book of Mormon, concentrate on the principal figure in the book—from its first chapter to the last—the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God.3 And look for a second undergirding theme: God will keep His covenants with the remnants of the house of Israel.4

The Book of Mormon is a crucial component of that covenant.5 It is holy scripture that encompasses sacred writings from the small and large plates of Nephi, the plates of Mormon, the plates of Ether, and the plates of brass, which contained ""the five books of Moses, … a record of the Jews, … and … prophecies of the holy prophets.""6

Many questions that have arisen from the Bible are answered for Latter-day Saints by the Book of Mormon, such as the mode of and reasons for baptism (2 Ne. 31; 3 Ne. 11:23-26); the proper way to administer the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper (Moro. 4-5); the nature of the Resurrection (Alma 40); the effects of the Fall of Adam, and the reasons for evil and suffering in the world (2 Ne. 2).

Many Latter-day Saints, including those born into LDS families, trace their conversion to Jesus Christ and their commitment toward the Church to prayerful study of the Book of Mormon, and through it they learn to recognize the Holy Spirit. Thus, the book becomes a continuing symbol of personal revelation and of God's love for and attention to the needs of each person. It also declares that all mankind will be judged by its precepts and commandments (Mosiah 3:24; Moro. 10:27; see Judgment).

As one biblical scholar notes, very often ""their resemblance to the Exodus is not mentioned outright, leaving it to the reader to decipher the hints and uncover the implicit links.""4 Like the Bible, the Book of Mormon provides many examples of the Exodus pattern, including the Moses typology.5",2

For most readers, the first option is simply out of the question. There are too many lengthy quotations, especially the twelve chapters dictated back-to-back in 2 Nephi 12–24, to imagine that Joseph Smith was producing all of this biblical content from memory. The translation process was rapid enough that he wouldn't have had time to commit long sequences of biblical text to memory before each translation session.

That the Book of Mormon stands strong after nearly 200 years of critical examination should bolster the confidence of those who accept it as inspired scripture and an authentic ancient record translated by the gift and power of God. Likewise, that skeptics have yet to offer a convincing counter-explanation for the existence of the Book of Mormon is strong evidence for its authenticity. This has, remarkably, not stopped dogmatic skeptics from ""look[ing] everywhere for explanations [for the Book of Mormon] except to the one explanation"" that was offered by Joseph Smith.32, 87, emphasis in original."")

Arguments that the Book of Mormon was derived from other nineteenth century books do not adequately explain its features—for example, its astounding narrative complexity, literary elegance, profound theology, and authentic ancient characteristics. Nor do such arguments account for the circumstances of its coming forth, including its rapid dictation, lack of revisions, and the testimonies of those who handled the plates and beheld the angel. The weight of the combined evidence affirms that the Book of Mormon is unlike any other nineteenth century work, and is an authentic ancient text. The testimony of the Holy Ghost given to sincere seekers ratifies this truth (Moroni 10:4–5).",3

means that the Book of Mormon contains mistakes—mistakes known to exist in the Bible!

As Yogi Berra reportedly said, ""I wish I had an answer to that because I'm tired of answering that question."" Latter-day Saints don't believe in inerrant scripture. We don't believe in the need for perfectly translated or dictated scripture to accept the text as the Word of God (and from a scholarly perspective, we don't believe that there is such a thing as a perfectly translated or dictated text). Any errors copied from the KJV into the same passages of the Book of Mormon have no bearing on the spiritual importance of the passages. In D&C 128, for example, Joseph Smith quotes Malachi 4:5–6 exactly as it is quoted in the King James Version of the Bible. In verse 7 the prophet Joseph added: ""I might have rendered a plainer translation to this, but it is sufficiently plain to suit my purpose as it stands.""

So even if, for sake of argument, we agree that Joseph Smith copied the KJV into the Book of Mormon, this information should have exactly zip, nada, zero impact on the belief that the Book of Mormon was translated from an authentic ancient document. It might be interpreted as evidence against the Book of Mormon, but such an interpretation is not required by the data.

Before we are so quick to give in to something that ultimately has little value to a critic, however, it should be noted that there are problems to this theory—the primary one being that those who witnessed the translation process claimed that Joseph expressly did not use the Bible when translating.3 Some were even asked point blank if he had used the Bible or other materials and they replied that he had not.",3

That was the language that people on the American frontier were familiar with. Those were the verses they knew from their own reading. Why *wouldn't* the Book of Mormon give those Isaiah verses in language that was already familiar to the people reading it for the first time?

On the page that Jeremy Runnells links to citing the errors in the text, there's a long quote by Stan Larson, a man who left the Church and then wrote a biography lauding Thomas Stuart Ferguson, whom we'll discuss later in this series, for also leaving the Church. The quote reads, in part:

*The Book of Mormon account of Jesus's sermon in* *3 Nephi 12**–**14* *originated in the nineteenth century, derived from unacknowledged plagiarism of the KJV. **Smith copied the KJV blindly, not showing awareness of translation problems and errors in the KJV.

We then declared that, like the Bible, the Book of Mormon is additional evidence that God loves all of His children and has provided a way for us to return and live with Him once again. We spent the next hour or so reviewing many aspects of the Book of Mormon, including its history and divine origin. Allow me to share a few of the things we discussed.",3

Why is it important for the world to have both the Bible and the Book of Mormon? I believe the answer is found in the 13th chapter of 1 Nephi. Nephi records: ""And the angel spake unto me, saying: These last records, which thou hast seen among the Gentiles [the Book of Mormon], shall establish the truth of the first [the Bible], which are of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, and shall make known the plain and precious things which have been taken away from them; and shall make known to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father, and the Savior of the world; and that all men must come unto him, or they cannot be saved"" (verse 40).

Neither the Bible nor the Book of Mormon in and of themselves is sufficient. Both are necessary for us to teach and learn about the full and complete doctrine of Christ. The need for the other does not diminish either one of them. Both the Bible and the Book of Mormon are necessary for our salvation and exaltation. As President Ezra Taft Benson so powerfully taught, ""When used together, the Bible and the Book of Mormon confound false doctrines"" (""A New Witness for Christ,"" *Ensign,* Nov. 1984, 8).",3

This American witness of Christ was written upon gold plates which were delivered to Joseph Smith by an angelic ministrant. This ancient record was then translated by the gift and power of God and is now published to the world as the Book of Mormon.

If this book is what it purports to be—if the original record was revealed by a holy angel; if the translation was made by the power of God and not of man; if Joseph Smith was entertaining angels, seeing visions, and receiving revelations—all of which is an established verity; if the Book of Mormon is true—then the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon proves the truth of this great latter-day work in which we are engaged.

All of this I explained to my two Protestant friends. One of them, a congenial and decent sort of fellow, said somewhat casually that he would read the Book of Mormon. The other minister, manifesting a bitter spirit, said: ""I won't read it. We have experts who have read the Book of Mormon, and I have read what our experts have to say about it.""

This account dramatizes one of our problems in presenting the message of the Book of Mormon to the world. There are sincere and devout people everywhere who have heard what other people say about this volume of holy writ, and so they do not read it themselves.",3

They teach that He is the Son of God, that He lived an exemplary life, that He atoned for all mankind, that He died upon the cross and rose again as the resurrected Lord. They teach that He is the Savior of the world.

Scriptural witnesses authenticate each other. This concept was explained long ago when a prophet wrote that the Book of Mormon was ""written for the intent that ye may believe [the Bible]; and if ye believe [the Bible] ye will believe [the Book of Mormon] also.""6 Each book refers to the other. Each book stands as evidence that God lives and speaks to His children by revelation to His prophets.7

Love for the Book of Mormon expands one's love for the Bible and vice versa. Scriptures of the Restoration do not compete with the Bible; they complement the Bible. We are indebted to martyrs who gave their lives so that we could have the Bible. It establishes the everlasting nature of the gospel and of the plan of happiness. The Book of Mormon restores and underscores biblical doctrines such as tithing,8 the temple,9 the Sabbath day,10 and the priesthood.11

An angel proclaimed that the Book of Mormon12 shall establish the truth of the Bible.13 He also revealed that writings in the Bible available in our day are not as complete as they were when originally written by prophets and apostles.14 He declared that the Book of Mormon shall restore plain and precious things taken away from the Bible.15",1

President Ezra Taft Benson affirmed, ""I have noted within the Church the difference in discernment, in insight, conviction, and spirit between those who know and love the Book of Mormon and those who do not. That book is a great sifter."" (New Era, May 1975, p. 19.) An understanding of the Book of Mormon can really help lock into place an individual's faith in Jesus Christ.

It is important to know what the Book of Mormon is *not.* It is not primarily a history, although much of what it contains is historical. The title page states that it is an account taken from the records of people living in the Americas before and after Christ. It was ""written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation. … And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.""

George Q. Cannon stated that ""the Book of Mormon is not a geographical primer. It was not written to teach geographical truths. What is told us of the situation of the various lands or cities … is usually simply an incidental remark connected with the doctrinal or historical portions of the work."" (Juvenile Instructor, Jan. 1890, p. 18.)

What, then, is the Book of Mormon? It is confirming evidence of the birth, life, and crucifixion of Jesus and of his work as the Messiah and the Redeemer. Nephi writes about the Book of Mormon: ""All ye ends of the earth, hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in these words believe in Christ. And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ."" (2 Ne. 33:10.)",0

After the meeting I had a private conversation with them, in which I said they could each gain a testimony that Joseph Smith was the prophet through whom the Lord had restored the fulness of the gospel for our day and for our time.

I told them they should read the Book of Mormon, ponder its great and eternal truths, and pray to the Father in the name of Christ, in faith, and he would reveal the truth of the book to them by the power of the Holy Ghost.

As every gospel scholar knows, the Book of Mormon proves that Joseph Smith was called of God to minister in the prophetic office and to restore the truths of salvation in plainness and perfection.

The Book of Mormon is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible. It contains a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. It is another testament of Jesus Christ.

It contains the fulness of the gospel, meaning that it is a record of the Lord's dealings with a people who had the fulness of the gospel, and meaning also that in it is found a summary and a recitation of what all men must believe and do to gain an inheritance in the heavenly kingdom reserved for the Saints.",2

While the Bible bears record of teachings the Lord gave to His prophets who lived in the Old World, the Book of Mormon contains teachings the Lord gave to His prophets who lived in the American hemisphere. This record covers a period of about a thousand years, from approximately 600 b.c. to a.d. 400 (although there is reference to other migrations and peoples preceding that time). The Book of Mormon bears record of the personal ministry of Jesus Christ, as the resurrected Lord, to inhabitants of ancient America. Prophets recorded His teachings among them. Hence, the Book of Mormon is ""Another Testament of Jesus Christ"" (Book of Mormon Title Page). It came in fulfillment of biblical prophecy: ""In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established"" (2 Cor. 13:1). It came as a heavenly gift to the entire human family. Originally inscribed on metallic plates and written in a modified Egyptian language, that record was preserved for many centuries, then made available for translation into the English language. That translation was done by the Prophet Joseph Smith through the gift and power of God. Subsequently, the book has been translated into many other languages. Since its first publication in 1830, millions of copies of the Book of Mormon have been printed. In the year 1992 alone, nearly five million copies were distributed.

We have observed that sincere study of the Book of Mormon transforms the spirit and engenders a testimony of Jesus Christ that heals the spiritual hearts of men and women throughout the world. The more widely it is read and understood, the greater is its influence for good. We find that as the Book of Mormon spreads to the four corners of the globe, men and women exhibit greater devotion and become promulgators of peace within their own families and society.",3

As with the Spalding-Rigdon Theory, however, there are serious problems with the theory that Joseph Smith plagiarized View of the Hebrews. For starters, as even proponents of the theory have admitted, there is no direct evidence that Joseph Smith was ever familiar with the contents of View of the Hebrews during the translation of the Book of Mormon.17 In addition, none of Joseph Smith's contemporary adversaries ever considered View of the Hebrews as a potential source of plagiarism, which would indicate that the supposed parallels between the two sources aren't as readily obvious as some have suggested. Finally, Joseph Smith, while acting as editor of the Times and Seasons, approvingly republished a quotation from View of the Hebrews.18: 813–814."") ""If the Prophet had originally used Ethan Smith's book to help him write the Book of Mormon, almost certainly he would not have later published a quote from it to illustrate a point, since plagiarists normally keep their sources a secret.""19",2

(History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 4:461.)

We believe the Bible to be the word of God, but I have often asked missionaries what they would do without the Book of Mormon and modern revelation. With just the Bible, what would be their approach? The Prophet Joseph answered it. ""Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations and where is our religion? We have none."" (HC, 2:52.)

If the Book of Mormon is not true, then Joseph Smith was not a prophet of God. I testify to you that the Book of Mormon is true and that the revelations contained in the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price and other places are true and of the Lord. Our message to the world is that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that God has revealed himself to man in this dispensation and restored his gospel with all its keys and power. Nothing will be more certain to build faith and testimonies of members and touch the hearts of honest seekers for the truth than this great book.

There is a special power about the Book of Mormon. It bears a strong, silent witness of its truth as one reads it.

Parley P. Pratt stated, ""The Spirit of the Lord came upon me, while I read [The Book of Mormon], and enlightened my mind, convinced my judgment, and rivetted the truth upon my understanding, so that I knew that the book was true, just as well as a man knows the daylight from the dark night."" (Journal of Discourses, 5:194.)

Brigham Young said as he read the book, ""I knew it was true, as well as I knew that I could see with my eyes, or feel by the touch of my fingers, or be sensible of the demonstration of any sense."" (JD, 3:91.)",3
