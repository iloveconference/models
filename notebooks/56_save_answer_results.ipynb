I never heard a man bear a stronger testimony than he did when under the influence of the Spirit.”[2](#f2) No wonder on December 5, 1834 Oliver was ordained an assistant to the Prophet Joseph. On that occasion Joseph said, “I lay my hands upon thee and ordain thee an assistant-president to the High and Holy Priesthood, in the Church of the Latter-day Saints.”[3](#f3) On April 3, 1836 Oliver was with Joseph as priesthood keys were received from ancient prophets Elijah, Elias, and Moses in the Kirtland Temple.  \\nAlthough Oliver stands alone as the contemporary who received many glorious manifestations with the Prophet Joseph Smith, nine formal charges were drawn against him on April 7, 1838 before the Far West high council, including the charge that he urged vexatious law suits be brought against the Saints and the charge that he sought to destroy the character of the Prophet Joseph. Oliver refused to attend the high council meeting when the charges were discussed. “*Give me my freedom or take my life!*” he wrote. “I shall no longer be bound by the chains of hell. I shall speak out when I see a move to deceive the ignorant.”[4](#f4) After deliberating on the charges against Oliver, the Far West high council excommunicated him on April 12, 1838.  \\nAlthough Oliver had lost fellowship with the Saints, Joseph Smith continued to reach out to him and encouraged the Quorum of the Twelve to do the same: “Write to Oliver Cowdery and ask him if he has not eaten husks long enough? If he is not almost ready to return, be clothed with robes of righteousness, and go up to Jerusalem?”[5](#f5) For years, Oliver rejected their entreaties.'},\n",

       "  'text': '**Casey Paul Griffiths** (LDS Scholar)  \\nThis revelation contains commendation and subtle warnings for five of Joseph Smith’s closest friends and family members. First, Oliver Cowdery is given a blessing, but also admonished to “beware of pride” (v. 1). Only a few months after this revelation was given, Oliver entered into contention with Joseph over some of the wording in the Articles and Covenants and then became embroiled in a dispute over who had the right to receive revelation in the Church. Oliver served as one of the most important leaders of the Church but was excommunicated in 1838. Wilford Woodruff related a conversation between Joseph and Oliver, stating, “If the president of the Church or either of his counselors or any of the apostles or any other man feels in his heart that God cannot do without him, and that he is especially important in order to carry on the work of the Lord, he stands upon slippery ground. I heard Joseph Smith say that Oliver Cowdery, who was the second apostle in this Church, said to him, ‘If I leave this Church it will fall.’ Said, Joseph, ‘Oliver, you try it.’ Oliver tried it. He fell.” (*Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,* 1990, p. 123).  \\n(*Doctrine & Covenants Minute*)'},\n",

       "  'text': '--------\\n\\n\\nAfter the Prophet Joseph Smith, no single person was more deeply involved in the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the restoration of the Church than Oliver Cowdery. Oliver was one of the three special witnesses chosen to bear record of the divinity of the Book of Mormon. He personally saw the Angel Moroni, the records and sacred relics, and heard the voice of God declare that the book was true. Despite all these incredible experiences, Oliver eventually grew bitter toward some new members of the Church’s leadership and was excommunicated in April 1838.[1](#footnote1_rfe4mad \"See Book of Mormon Central, “Why Was Oliver Cowdery Excommunicated from the Church?” KnoWhy 603 (May 11, 2021).\") A decade later, Oliver returned and was rebaptized into the Church. What caused Oliver to come back?\\n\\n\\nAfter leaving Missouri in the fall of 1838, Oliver traveled to Kirtland, Ohio, where he briefly practiced law with his brother Lyman, who was not a member of the Church. A short time later, Oliver relocated to Tiffin, Ohio, where he lived and practiced law for the next seven years. By 1842, Oliver was visited several times by Phineas Young, a devoted friend, and the husband of Oliver’s half-sister Lucy. After several conversations with Oliver, Phineas was able to report to his brother Brigham Young, the president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, that Oliver’s heart “is still with his old friends.”[2](#footnote2_eq6hpgh \"Phineas Young, with postscript by Oliver, to Willard Richards and Brigham Young, 14 December 1842, Tiffin, Ohio, Brigham Young Collection, Church History Library.\")'},\n",
