The singulars “fault” and “mistake” were changed by Joseph Smith to plurals “faults” and “mistakes” in the second edition of the Book of Mormon, printed in Kirtland in 1837. This comports partially with Moroni\\'s words in Mormon 8:17, “and if there be faults they be the faults of a man.”\")\\n\\n\\nBy its own admission the Book of Mormon is not a perfect text, something the book’s authors and compilers themselves frequently insisted ([1 Nephi 19:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.6?lang=eng#p5); [Mormon 8:12, 16–17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.12,16-17?lang=eng#p11); [Mormon 9:31](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.31?lang=eng#p30); [Ether 12:23–25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.23-25?lang=eng#p22)).\\n\\n\\nAlthough the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ as contained in the Book of Mormon remain correct, the text itself suffered some problems and difficulties not only in its initial recording by ancient prophets, but also in its transcription, typesetting, and transmission from edition to edition in the latter days.\\n\\n\\nEven so, as Wilford Woodruff recorded in 1841, “Joseph said the Book of Mormon [is] the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.”[3](#footnote3_sps29e5 \"B. H. Roberts, ed., History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1948),\\xa04:461. The source underlying this entry in History of the Church comes from Wilford Woodruff’s journal entry on November 28, 1841. “Joseph Said the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any Book on Earth & the key stone of our religion & a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than by any other Book.” Wilford Woodruff, Journal, November 28, 1841.\")\\n\\n\\nMany have wondered how this could be if there were possible mistakes made in the book’s textual history. Latter-day Saint scholar Hugh Nibley answered this question by distinguishing between the message of the Book of Mormon and the “mechanical details” of its printing:\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n> Joseph Smith . . . proclaimed [the Book of Mormon] the most correct book on earth. Most correct in what sense? . . . What is a “correct” book? One with properly cut margins, appropriate binding, a useful index, accurately numbered pages? Not at all; these are mere mechanical details, as are also punctuation, spelling, and even grammar—those matters about which the critics of the Book of Mormon have made such a to-do.[4](#footnote4_f2zpgdd \"Hugh Nibley, Since Cumorah, The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley: Volume 7 (Provo: FARMS, 1988), 8.\")\\n> \\n> \\n> \\n\\n\\n[![Royal Skousen with facsimile of the Original Manuscript](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2015/extra/mistakes/skousen-2.jpg)](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2015/extra/mistakes/skousen-2.jpg \"Royal Skousen with facsimile of the Original Manuscript\")\\n\\n\\nIt seems clear that the Book of Mormon is the “most correct book on earth” because by living and applying its teachings one can come closer to God than by any other book.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn a revelation given to the Prophet in 1832, the Lord explained that members of the Church “remain under . . . condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon and the former commandments which I have given them, not only to say, but to do according to that which I have written” ([Doctrine and Covenants 84:57](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.57?lang=eng#p56).\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThus, the “correctness” of the Book of Mormon, along with other holy scripture, is not to be found in any supposed mechanical or verbal perfection, but rather with the transformative power it has in correcting and guiding the lives of readers who follow its teachings.\\n\\n\\nThat being said, close examination of the manuscripts and various printed editions of the Book of Mormon help readers appreciate the true integrity of its text. This kind of scholarly examination is called a “critical text” analysis.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWork to produce a Book of Mormon “critical text,” or the uncovering of the textual history of the English Book of Mormon, has been a particularly fruitful area of academic research for Latter-day Saint scholars. Early work done by scholars broke the ground for analyzing selected changes in the English Book of Mormon throughout its transmission history.[5](#footnote5_odrrcbw \"Jeffrey R.

To discuss all of the findings of Skousen’s voluminous work is far beyond the scope of this brief treatment. Nevertheless, broadly speaking, in addition to tracking changes in the Book of Mormon text, Skousen’s work has revealed three major findings related to the Book of Mormon text \\xa0worth highlighting. As Skousen himself explained in a 2012 article:\\n\\n\\n\\n> I have concluded that there are three important findings resulting from the critical text project of the Book of Mormon. The first is that Joseph Smith received an English-language text word for word, which he read off to his scribe. The second finding is that the original English-language text itself was very precisely constructed; where textual error has occurred in its transmission, the earliest reading is usually the superior reading. The third finding is the identification of 256 changes in the text that make a difference in the meaning or in the spelling of a name, changes that would show up in any translation of the book. Ultimately, these findings have led me to the conclusion that a rigorous study of the Book of Mormon requires the most accurate text possible.[8](#footnote8_qjxwblc \"Royal Skousen, “Some Textual Changes for a Scholarly Study of the Book of Mormon,” BYU Studies Quarterly 51, no. 4 (2012): 99–100.\")\\n> \\n> \\n> \\n\\n\\nIn addition to these three points, Skousen has identified non-English Hebraisms in the Book of Mormon text, including Hebraisms in the earliest manuscripts of the Book of Mormon that were later excised, apparently due to the awkwardness of these Hebrew-like linguistic constructs in English.[9](#footnote9_ipfxtxf \"Royal Skousen, “The Original Language of the Book of Mormon: Upstate New York Dialect, King James English, or Hebrew?” Journal of Book of Mormon Studies 3/1 (1994): 28–38; Skousen, The Book of Mormon: The Earliest Text, xxxvi–xxxvii.\")\\n\\n\\nSkousen and his research collaborator Stanford Carmack have also argued that the English language of the Book of Mormon is not to be attributed to the 19th-century English of Joseph Smith’s day, but rather uses idioms from an earlier period in the development of the English language.[10](#footnote10_wz278qx \"Skousen, The Book of Mormon: The Earliest Text, xxxvii–xxxix. See also Royal Skousen, “The Nature of the Original Text,” Stanford Carmack, “A Look at Some ‘Nonstandard’ Book of Mormon Grammar,” Interpreter: A Journal of Mormon Scripture\\xa011 (2014): 209–262; “What Command Syntax Tells Us About Book of Mormon Authorship,” Interpreter: A Journal of Mormon Scripture\\xa013 (2015): 175–217; “The Implications of Past-Tense Syntax in the Book of Mormon,” Interpreter: A Journal of Mormon Scripture\\xa014 (2015): 119–186; “Why the Oxford English Dictionary (and not Webster’s 1828),” Interpreter: A Journal of Mormon Scripture\\xa015 (2015): 65–77; “Exploding the Myth of Unruly Book of Mormon Grammar: A Look at the Excellent Match with Early Modern English,”.\")\\n\\n\\nThe resulting Book of Mormon Critical Text is indispensable in helping readers understand the nature of the Nephite record and the Prophet’s translation. From historical accounts, Joseph saw and methodically dictated the words of the text to his scribe.[11](#footnote11_u99datf \"For a recent account of Joseph’s means and methods of translation, see Michael Hubbard MacKay and Gerrit J. Dirkmaat, “Firsthand Witness Accounts of the Translation Process,” in The Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon: A Marvelous Work and a Wonder, ed. Dennis L. Largey et al. (Provo: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 2015), 61–79. Especially from Martin Harris’ accounts, the translation process included Joseph placing his seer stone into his hat, drawing the brim of the hat around his face to exclude the ambient light in the room.\") Line-by-line evidence in the manuscript, as shown by Skousen, corroborates this historical evidence and points to this bringing forth of a “tight” translation of the text.[12](#footnote12_sz900uu \"Royal Skousen, “Translating the Book of Mormon: Evidence from the Original Manuscript,” in Book of Mormon Authorship Revisited: The Evidence for Ancient Origins, ed. Noel B. Reynolds (Provo, UT: FARMS, 1997), 61–93; “‘A theory! A theory! We have already got a theory, and there cannot be any more theories!’” Skousen and Jensen, Revelations and Translations, Volume 3, Part 1, xvii–xxv. The exact “tightness” of the translation of the Book of Mormon, and all that it entails, remains open for discussion. \")\\n\\n\\nThe critical text has been helpful not only in clarifying confusing passages that were the result of transcription errors, but \\xa0also it has identified and explained places where editors have sought to make stylistic improvements in the text.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOne example of the latter can be seen in Moroni’s words near the end of the Book of Mormon title page quoted above at the beginning of this article. While the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon read “if there be fault, it be the mistake of men,” the 1837 edition of the Book of Mormon, edited by Joseph Smith himself, was amended to read “if there are faults, they are the mistakes of men.”[13](#footnote13_b8xjn37 \"The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon, upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi (Kirtland, OH: P. P. Pratt and J. Goodson; printed by O. Cowdery & Co., 1837).\") It would appear that the Prophet made this modification to make the passage more readable.[14](#footnote14_9pbtf4q \"See the analysis of this passage in Royal Skousen, Analysis of Textual Variants of the Book of Mormon: Part One: 1 Nephi 1–2 Nephi 10 (Provo: FARMS, 2004), 33.

This confirms what the Lord told Oliver Cowdery in June 1829, the same month as the completion of the translation of the Book of Mormon,[15](#footnote15_cjdyic2 \"Davidson, Karen Lynn, David J. Whittaker, Mark Ashurst-McGee, and Richard L. Jensen, eds. Histories, Volume 1: Joseph Smith Histories, 1832–1844.\\xa0Vol. 1 of the Histories series of\\xa0The Joseph Smith Papers,\\xa0edited by Dean C. Jessee, Ronald K. Esplin, and Richard Lyman Bushman (Salt Lake City: Church Historian’s Press, 2012), 353–359.\") “Behold, I have manifested unto you, by my Spirit in many instances, that the things which you have written are true; wherefore you know that they are true. And if you know that they are true, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that you rely upon the things which are written; For in them are all things written concerning the foundation of my church, my gospel, and my rock” ([Doctrine and Covenants 18:2–4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.2-4?lang=eng#p1)).\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe “things which [Oliver] has written” spoken of in this passage certainly included the Book of Mormon. With Skousen’s work, Latter-day Saints have verification alongside the witness of the Spirit that they can indeed “rely” on the Book of Mormon as a credible witness and a solid scriptural foundation. “Errors have crept into the text,” Skousen acknowledges, “but no errors significantly interfere with either the message of the [Book of Mormon] or its doctrine. These textual errors have never prevented readers of the Book of Mormon from receiving their own personal witness of its truth.” As such, “all of this worry over the number of changes [in the Book of Mormon] is specious. . . . The word of God still comes through . . . the Book of Mormon despite the occasional errors in transmission.”[16](#footnote16_jx83l62 \"Royal Skousen, “Changes in The Book of Mormon,” Interpreter: A Journal of Mormon Scripture\\xa011 (2014): 172.\")\\n\\n\\nOne may safely conclude that the authenticity of the Book of Mormon is supported by both the testimony of the flesh-and-blood Book of Mormon witnesses, such as Martin Harris and David Whitmer, as well as the testimony of the ink-and-paper Book of Mormon manuscripts.\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n---------------\\n\\n\\nThe full Book of Mormon Critical Text can be found on this [Book of Mormon Central website](http://www.bookofmormoncentral.org/content/book-mormon-earliest-text) and a new [Book of Mormon Critical Text](http://bookofmormoncriticaltext.byustudies.byu.edu/) website, part of [BYU Studie](http://byustudies.byu.edu/)s.

One of the questions asked, “Was not Jo Smith a money\\xa0digger,” meaning somebody who was hired to locate buried treasure. To this, the Prophet answered ironically, “Yes, but it was never a very profitable job to him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it.”[1](#footnote1_2r26y1i \"Elders’ Journal\\xa01, no. 3 (July 1838): 43. $14 in the 1820s was the equivalent to between $300–$380 in 2019, depending on the year, as calculated at\\xa0https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation.\")\\n\\n\\nThis quip highlights one of the common questions many people have asked about Joseph Smith: how much did a “magic world view” influence the Prophet and his account of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon?

According to these scholars, the coming forth of the Book of Mormon can be seen, in part, as the direct result of Joseph participating in this “magic world view.”[4](#footnote4_po5n15g \"D.

Steeped in the language of the Bible and a mixture of Anglo-European cultures brought over by immigrants to North America, some people in the early 19th century believed it was possible for gifted individuals to “see,” or receive spiritual manifestations, through material objects such as seer stones.\\n> \\n> \\n> The young Joseph Smith accepted such familiar folk ways of his day, including the idea of using seer stones to view lost or hidden objects. Since the biblical narrative showed God using physical objects to focus people’s faith or communicate spiritually in ancient times, Joseph and others assumed the same for their day. Joseph’s parents, Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith, affirmed the family’s immersion in this culture and their use of physical objects in this way, and the villagers of Palmyra and Manchester, New York, where the Smiths lived, sought out Joseph to find lost objects before he moved to Pennsylvania in late 1827.[8](#footnote8_8s0m842 \"Richard\\xa0E.

As Johannes Dillinger observes, “Treasure hunters invoked saints as well as demons who were supposed to help them find a treasure or simply bring them money. St Christopher became the patron saint of treasure hunters. Most treasures, it was believed, were watched over by ghosts. The idea of a wraith guarding a treasure belonged to a whole set of beliefs about the spirits of the dead doing penance or trying to fulfil certain tasks. Ghosts had to walk until a task that they had left unfulfilled in their lifetime was completed or until some guilt was expiated. The treasure’s owner was guilty of the deadly sin of avarice. He might also have failed to give the treasure to a good cause or – in the case where it had been gained by unlawful means – to return it to its rightful owner. Thus, he had to come back as a ghost. The discovery of the treasure was in the ghost’s own interest because this was a precondition for its redemption.\\xa0As treasure hunters helped the ghost to leave the visible world, treasure hunting could be presented as a godly deed and a Christian duty. The idea that the recovery of a treasure was an act of piety because it resulted in the redemption of a wandering soul was a genuine part of the motivation of many treasure hunters.\\xa0Even though learned Protestantism negated the existence of ghosts unconditionally, this attitude seems not to have had any effect at the popular level. . . .\\xa0The more emphasis was placed on the redemption of the ghost as a godly deed, the more important it became to prepare for this religious task through prayer and devotion. At times, the treasure-hunting group acquired characteristics of a religious community, with the magician as its spiritual leader. In this role, he could wield considerable power over people who were his social superiors. Within such groups, the social and denominational differences between members lost some of their importance.\\xa0The treasure-hunting parties had characteristics of business enterprises as well as of religious congregations.” Johannes Dillinger,\\xa0Magical Treasure Hunting in Europe and North America\\xa0(London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), 205–207, emphasis added.\")\\xa0As Richard Bushman, one of Joseph Smith’s leading biographers, has recently observed, looking closely at historical folk practices, it is clear that for nineteenth-century Yankees, like the Smith family,\\n\\n\\n\\n> magic and Christianity did not seem at odds with one another. The combination was altogether too common in the nineteenth century for it to invalidate Joseph Smith’s more conventional religious claims. [For early Latter-day Saints] and for many Christians, folk traditions and religion blend. To call the two incongruous seems more like a matter of religious [or ideological] taste than a necessary conclusion.[10](#footnote10_mkdeclx \"Richard Lyman Bushman, “Joseph Smith and Money Digging,” in\\xa0A Reason for Faith: Navigating LDS Doctrine and Church History, ed.

Any attempt to make this distinction “belongs to the domain of theological polemics . . . and cannot claim any scholarly foundation.”[11](#footnote11_75qiffy \"Wouter J. Hanegraaff, “The Study of Western Esotericism: New Approaches to Christian and Secular Culture,” in\\xa0New Approaches to the Study of Religion, Vol. 1: Regional, Critical, and Historical Approaches, ed. Peter Antes, Armin W. Geertz, and Randi R. Warne (Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2004), 513–14.\")\\n\\n\\nHistorians have also recently pointed out that the extent of Joseph Smith’s involvement in folk magic during his youth, or at least the influence such had on the young seer, may have been exaggerated over the years due to authors uncritically repeating outdated or questionable arguments. As Bushman in 2016 has written,\\n\\n\\n\\n> At present, a question remains about how involved Joseph Smith was in folk magic. Was he enthusiastically pursuing treasure seeking as a business in the 1820s, or was he a somewhat reluctant participant, egged on by his father? Was his worldview fundamentally shaped by folk traditions? I think there is substantial evidence of his reluctance, and, in my opinion, the evidence for extensive involvement is tenuous. But this is a matter of degree. No one denies that magic was there, especially in the mid-1820s. Smith never repudiated folk traditions; he continued to use the seer stone until late in life and used it in the translation process. It certainly had an influence on his outlook, but it was peripheral—not central. Biblical Christianity was the overwhelming influence in the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants. Folk magic was in the mix but was not the basic ingredient.[12](#footnote12_1c9yu8b \"Bushman, “Joseph Smith and Money Digging,” 4.\")\\n> \\n> \\n> \\n\\n\\nThis need for caution is illustrated in discussions of the use of seer stones in the translation of the Book of Mormon. It is evident from historical records that, in bringing forth and dictating the translation of the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith used, at varying times in 1828 and 1829, either the Nephite Interpreters (later called the Urim and Thummim) or his personal seer stone that he had previously used in treasure seeking and other folk practices.[13](#footnote13_s23fp2f \"See Book of Mormon Central,\\xa0“Why Was a Stone Used as an Aid in Translating the Book of Mormon?”\\xa0KnoWhy\\xa0145 (July 18, 2016);\\xa0“The Gift and Power of God,”\\xa0chapter 6 in\\xa0Saints: The Story of the Church of Jesus Christ in the Latter Days, Volume 1: The Standard of Truth, 1815–1846\\xa0(Salt Lake City, UT: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2018), 54–64;\\xa0“Book of Mormon Translation,”\\xa0Gospel Topics, topics.lds.org; Michael Hubbard MacKay and Gerrit J.

Nephi, for instance, likened the words of Isaiah about the Lord doing “a\\xa0marvelous work\\xa0among this people, yea, a\\xa0marvelous work\\xa0and a wonder” to describe the coming forth and translation of the Book of Mormon in modern times ([2 Nephi 27:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.26?lang=eng#p25); cf.\\xa0[Isaiah 29:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/29.14?lang=eng#p13)). This phrase from Isaiah (“marvelous work\\xa0and a wonder”; from the Hebrew root *plʾ*; “extraordinary,” “wonderful,” “miraculous”) that Nephi drew upon acts as a parallelism that emphasizes how God would accomplish a work so remarkable and explanation-defying that it would confound the wisemen of Israel (“for the\\xa0wisdom\\xa0of their wise\\xa0men\\xa0shall\\xa0perish, and\\xa0the\\xa0understanding\\xa0of their\\xa0prudent\\xa0men\\xa0shall be hid”). What better way to describe the inspired translation of the Book of Mormon by “an unlearned youth,”[22](#footnote22_npwxgtu \"Joseph Smith, Letter to James Arlington Bennet, 13 November 1843, [1a].\")\\xa0a feat which still today defies secular or naturalistic explanation.[23](#footnote23_84t9pzl \"Brian C.

As Bushman astutely observed, when encountering challenging information about the past, including the early life of Joseph Smith and the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, “we need to keep in mind that the wheels of history grind slowly, but they grind exceeding fine. What seems central at one moment in time will lose force as the years go by.” Using specifically the example of Joseph Smith’s folk practices, Bushman recognized that with careful and more thorough scholarship “magic [has] moved to the sidelines over the years,” and thus wonders “will other issues be next? We should be careful about putting too much weight on the criticisms of the moment when it is uncertain how enduring they will be.”[24](#footnote24_4w014fo \"Bushman, “Joseph Smith and Money Digging,” 4.\")\\n\\n\\n*This KnoWhy was made possible by the generous contributions of Arlo & Jackie Luke.*\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n---------------\\n\\n\\nBook of Mormon Central, [“Were Joseph Smith’s Translation Instruments Like the Israelite Urim and Thummim?”](https://knowhy.bookofmormoncentral.org/knowhy/were-joseph-smiths-translation-instruments-like-the-israelite-urim-and-thummim) *KnoWhy* #417 (March 20, 2018).\\n\\n\\nBook of Mormon Central, [“Why Was a Stone Used as an Aid in Translating the Book of Mormon?”](https://knowhy.bookofmormoncentral.org/knowhy/why-was-a-stone-used-as-an-aid-in-translating-the-book-of-mormon) *KnoWhy* #145 (July 18, 2016).\\n\\n\\nBook of Mormon Central, [“Why is a Seer Greater than a Prophet?”](https://knowhy.bookofmormoncentral.org/knowhy/why-is-a-seer-greater-than-a-prophet) *KnoWhy* #86 (April 26, 2016).\\n\\n\\nRichard Lyman Bushman, “Joseph Smith and Money Digging,” in *A Reason for Faith: Navigating LDS Doctrine and Church History*, ed.

As Johannes Dillinger observes, “Treasure hunters invoked saints as well as demons who were supposed to help them find a treasure or simply bring them money. St Christopher became the patron saint of treasure hunters. Most treasures, it was believed, were watched over by ghosts. The idea of a wraith guarding a treasure belonged to a whole set of beliefs about the spirits of the dead doing penance or trying to fulfil certain tasks. Ghosts had to walk until a task that they had left unfulfilled in their lifetime was completed or until some guilt was expiated. The treasure’s owner was guilty of the deadly sin of avarice. He might also have failed to give the treasure to a good cause or – in the case where it had been gained by unlawful means – to return it to its rightful owner. Thus, he had to come back as a ghost. The discovery of the treasure was in the ghost’s own interest because this was a precondition for its redemption.\\xa0*As treasure hunters helped the ghost to leave the visible world, treasure hunting could be presented as a godly deed and a Christian duty. The idea that the recovery of a treasure was an act of piety because it resulted in the redemption of a wandering soul was a genuine part of the motivation of many treasure hunters.*\\xa0Even though learned Protestantism negated the existence of ghosts unconditionally, this attitude seems not to have had any effect at the popular level. . . .\\xa0*The more emphasis was placed on the redemption of the ghost as a godly deed, the more important it became to prepare for this religious task through prayer and devotion*. At times, the treasure-hunting group acquired characteristics of a religious community, with the magician as its spiritual leader. In this role, he could wield considerable power over people who were his social superiors. Within such groups, the social and denominational differences between members lost some of their importance.\\xa0The *treasure-hunting parties had characteristics of business enterprises as well as of religious congregations*.” Johannes Dillinger,\\xa0*Magical Treasure Hunting in Europe and North America*\\xa0(London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), 205–207, emphasis added.\\n* [10.](#footnoteref10_mkdeclx) Richard Lyman Bushman, “Joseph Smith and Money Digging,” in\\xa0*A Reason for Faith: Navigating LDS Doctrine and Church History*, ed.

Donald W. Parry and John W. Welch (Provo, UT: FARMS, 1998), 373.\") Whatever portions of Isaiah were accessible to Nephi on the brass plates and ultimately quoted on his small plates, it seems clear the translated English of the Book of Mormon text follows the KJV and is not a wholly original translation of Joseph Smith’s. The exact reasons for this remain debated by scholars,[4](#footnote4_bwpo5go \"For another view, see Brant Gardner, The Gift and Power: Translating the Book of Mormon (Salt Lake City, UT: Greg Kofford Books, 2011), 303–307.\") but the answer likely relates to what the Lord revealed to Joseph Smith in 1831:\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n> These commandments [the revelations that comprise the Doctrine and Covenants] are of me, and were given unto my servants in their weakness, after the manner of their language, that they might come to understanding ([Doctrine and Covenants 1:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.24?lang=eng#p23)).\\xa0\\n> \\n> \\n> \\n\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2016/extra/criticaltext/translation-400.jpg)](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2016/extra/criticaltext/translation.jpg \"Copyright 2014 Anthony Sweat\")\\n\\n\\nLater in 1842, the Prophet similarly remarked about the translation of a passage from the biblical book of Malachi: “I might have rendered a plainer translation to this, but it is sufficiently plain to suit my purpose as it stands” ([D&C 128:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.18?lang=eng#p17)). The objective of translation is to speak with sufficient plainness to the main target audience.\\n\\n\\nSecond, Skousen finds evidence in the \\xa0original Book of Mormon manuscript that shows that the Isaiah passages and other biblical quotations were “dictated by Joseph Smith; no physical copy was given to Oliver Cowdery to copy from.”[5](#footnote5_3kt915y \"Skousen, “Textual Variants in the Isaiah Quotations,” 377.\") This finding agrees with what the witnesses of the translation said, namely that Joseph Smith used no books or notes in bringing forth the Book of Mormon text. Likewise, Skousen also points out that this can be confirmed by Oliver Cowdery’s misspellings of certain words, which makes sense if he was hearing a text being dictated and not *copying* from a printed page.\\n\\n\\nThird, it is noteworthy that “the original Book of Mormon chapter divisions of the Isaiah quotations follow a larger thematic grouping, not the interruptive chapter system found in the King James Bible.”[6](#footnote6_f7zmyf7 \"Skousen, “Textual Variants in the Isaiah Quotations,” 378.\") Said another way, “the original Book of Mormon chapter divisions ignore the chapter system found in the King James Bible.”[7](#footnote7_q3khjrk \"Skousen, “Textual Variants in the Isaiah Quotations,” 378.\") Instead, as other scholars have noted, the Book of Mormon’s division of Isaiah follows an intricate and larger literary or thematic scheme.[8](#footnote8_45p5q6j \"See for instance John Gee, “‘Choose the Things That Please Me’: On the Selection of the Isaiah Passages in the Book of Mormon,” in Isaiah in the Book of Mormon, 67–94; David Rolph Seely, “Nephi’s Use of Isaiah 2–14 in 2 Nephi 12–30,” in Isaiah in the Book of Mormon, 151–170; Grant Hardy, Understanding the Book of Mormon: A Reader’s Guide (New York, N. Y.: Oxford University Press, 2010), 58–86.\")\\n\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2016/extra/criticaltext/books-shelf-500.jpg)](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2016/extra/criticaltext/books-shelf.jpg \"The Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon is closer to the KJV than subsequent editions of the text\")\\n\\n\\nFourth, “The original Book of Mormon text is closer to the King James Version.”[9](#footnote9_kbyclia \"Skousen, “Textual Variants in the Isaiah Quotations,” 379.\") By this Skousen means Oliver Cowdery made a few alterations, whether purposely or inadvertently, to the Isaiah quotations as he prepared the Printer’s Manuscript of the Book of Mormon for publication. As such, the Original Manuscript is closer to the KJV than subsequent editions of the text.[10](#footnote10_cdzh0nt \"Skousen, “Textual Variants in the Isaiah Quotations,” 381.\")\\n\\n\\nFifth, “The majority of differences between the Book of Mormon text and the Isaiah text are *not* associated with italicized words in the King James Version.”[11](#footnote11_xspel2l \"Skousen, “Textual Variants in the Isaiah Quotations,” 381, emphasis in original.\") The significance of this remains a point of contention among scholars, since some changes do align with the italicized (supplied) word in the KJV, and how closely the Book of Mormon follows the KJV’s italics may indicate whether Joseph was directly copying from or subconsciously influenced by the KJV.[12](#footnote12_wiwodbj \"On this, see generally the sources above under “further reading” and Gardner’s book in note 5.\")\\n\\n\\nSixth, “Corrections in the original manuscript give very little evidence for the hypothesis that Joseph Smith altered the text while he supposedly read it off from a King James Bible.”[13](#footnote13_t7s59g8 \"Skousen, “Textual Variants in the Isaiah Quotations,” 382.\") Essentially, Skousen finds no evidence that Joseph Smith was consciously editing or correcting himself as he dictated the Isaiah passages in 2 Nephi.[14](#footnote14_jp8msxu \"Skousen, “Textual Variants in the Isaiah Quotations,” 385.\")\\n\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2016/extra/criticaltext/skousen-books-400.jpg)](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2016/extra/criticaltext/skousen-books.jpg \"Royal Skousen\\'s critical text project helps readers learn about the evolution of the Book of Mormon text from its original manuscript\")\\n\\n\\nSeventh, “The few Isaiah passages that have been quoted more than once in the Book of Mormon may provide evidence for helping to restore the original reading.”[15](#footnote15_raeftuj \"Skousen, “Textual Variants in the Isaiah Quotations,” 385.\") Here Skousen has in mind the few instances where the Book of Mormon quotes the same Isaiah passage twice (such as [Isaiah 11:4–9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/11.4-9?lang=eng#p3) in [2 Nephi 21:4–9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/21.4-9?lang=eng#p3) and again in [2 Nephi 30:9, 11–15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/30.9,11-15?lang=eng#p8)). These cross-checks show a consistency in Joseph’s translation processes, as he would not have turned back to that block of text in his printed Bible as he wove those verses into Nephi’s explanation of that passage quoted earlier.\\n\\n\\nEighth, “Joseph Smith’s ‘New Translation’ of the Bible used the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon as a source for changing some of the corresponding biblical text in Isaiah.”[16](#footnote16_7lwruh8 \"Skousen, “Textual Variants in the Isaiah Quotations,” 387.\") From the available evidence it would appear that the Prophet based some of his revisions of the biblical text (called today the Joseph Smith Translation) on the Book of Mormon, not on the KJV. Skousen explains,\\n\\n\\n\\n> The Joseph Smith Translation . . . shows that Joseph Smith sometimes used the Book of Mormon text to make changes in the Isaiah text of the Bible. . . . It is not surprising that Joseph Smith viewed the Book of Mormon as an inspired text and thus felt free to use the Book of Mormon in altering the biblical text of Isaiah [in the JST]. But apparently he did not realize the extent to which his copy text, the 1830 edition, contained textual errors; as a consequence, these errors were carried over into the JST.[17](#footnote17_zjgigzd \"Skousen, “Textual Variants in the Isaiah Quotations,” 387–388.\")\\n> \\n> \\n> \\n\\n\\nThe Why\\n-------\\n\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2016/extra/criticaltext/nephi-isaiah.jpg)](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2016/extra/criticaltext/nephi-isaiah.jpg \"Image by Book of Mormon Central\")\\n\\n\\nWithout a doubt, the words of Isaiah are difficult to interpret. They were probably hard for people in Isaiah\\'s day to understand, and they are even harder to grasp today. But the Book of Mormon encourages and enables modern readers to find great value in Isaiah’s important prophecies. The sheer volume of Isaiah chapters in the small plates of Nephi tells us that Lehi, Nephi, and Jacob saw Isaiah (who died only about twenty years before Lehi was born) as the guiding star of Israelite prophets in their day.\\n\\n\\nAncient scribes were, for the most part, extremely conscientious. Although changes could occur from one copy to another, it is impressive to see how close the Isaiah texts in Dead Sea Scrolls still conform to the Masoretic Hebrew over a thousand years later. This helps to explain why the Isaiah texts in the Book of Mormon conform substantially with those in the Bible.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhere differences occur, scholars may wonder what those difference may or may not mean. This examination of minute variants is indeed a complex subject, and ordinary readers may well find the payoffs to be less than the effort required to delve deeply into this complex and arcane topic. It is still helpful and worth knowing, however, that such textual criticism provides insight into the textual history of our sacred Book of Mormon text, where every word counts. It also helps readers understand a little better how the text was revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith.[18](#footnote18_e7bol92 \"Skousen, “Textual Variants in the Isaiah Quotations,” 389.\")\\n\\n\\nEven though this topic is indeed complex, these issues “never prevent us from understanding the spiritual message of the Book of Mormon.”[19](#footnote19_6wmmxqr \"Skousen, “Textual Variants in the Isaiah Quotations,” 389.\") In the details of the Book of Mormon’s text we can find joy and rich meaning, especially in Isaiah’s prophecies concerning the coming of the Redeemer and the gathering of Israel in the last days. We can likewise better appreciate the concentration and inspiration that went into the translation of the Book of Mormon on the part of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the meticulous diligence of his scribes who recorded his carefully dictated words.\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n---------------\\n\\n\\nRoyal Skousen, “Textual Variants in the Isaiah Quotations of the Book of Mormon,” in *Isaiah in the Book of Mormon*, ed.

Holland \\n\\n\\n\\n“And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye—for Christ will show unto you, with power and great glory, that they are his words, at the last day.”2 Nephi 33:11\\n=============\\n\\nThe Know\\n--------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nElder Jeffrey R. Holland, during the LDS General Conference on October 4, 2009, delivered a sermon entitled “Safety for the Soul.” In it, Elder Holland spoke of “prophecies regarding the last days” and how individuals could find safety and shelter from strife and calamities foretold.\\n\\n\\nAccording to Elder Holland, preeminent in the Lord’s arsenal to combat the evils of the world is the Book of Mormon, as the book is infused with “the power of Christ to counter all troubles in all times—including the end of times.”\\n\\n\\n[![The Book of Mormon referenced in Elder Holland\\'s talk.](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2015/extra/holland/holland2-500.jpg)](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2015/extra/holland/holland2.png \"The Book of Mormon referenced in Elder Holland\\'s talk.\")\\n\\n\\nFollowing those words came one of the most powerful apostolic witnesses of the Book of Mormon. After recounting how Hyrum Smith read from the Book of Mormon ([Ether 12:36–38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.36-38?lang=eng#p35)) on the day of his and Joseph Smith’s martyrdom, Elder Holland remarked, “before closing the book, Hyrum turned down the corner of the page from which he had read, marking it as part of the everlasting testimony for which these two brothers were about to die.” Then came perhaps the most unforgettable moment of Elder Holland’s testimony.\\n\\n\\n\\n> I hold in my hand that book, the very copy from which Hyrum read, the same corner of the page turned down, still visible. Later, when actually incarcerated in the jail, Joseph the Prophet turned to the guards who held him captive and bore a powerful testimony of the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon. Shortly thereafter pistol and ball would take the lives of these two testators.\\n> \\n> \\n> \\n\\n\\nThe Why\\n-------\\n\\n\\nElder Holland then declared his own testimony of the Book of Mormon, but not before asking a penetrating question to those who question the book’s divinity.\\n\\n\\n\\n> As one of a thousand elements of my own testimony of the divinity of the Book of Mormon, I submit this as yet one more evidence of its truthfulness. In this their greatest—and last—hour of need, I ask you: would these men blaspheme before God by continuing to fix their lives, their honor, and their own search for eternal salvation on a book (and by implication a church and a ministry) they had fictitiously created out of whole cloth? . . . [T]ell me whether in this hour of death these two men would enter the presence of their Eternal Judge quoting from and finding solace in a book which, if *not* the very word of God, would brand them as imposters and charlatans until the end of time? *They would not do that!* They were willing to die rather than deny the divine origin and the eternal truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.\\n> \\n> \\n> \\n\\n\\nElder Holland continued, “For 179 years this book has been examined and attacked, denied and deconstructed, targeted and torn apart like perhaps no other book in modern religious history—perhaps like no other book in *any* religious history.”\\n\\n\\n\\n> And still it stands. Failed theories about its origins have been born and parroted and have died—from Ethan Smith to Solomon Spaulding to deranged paranoid to cunning genius. None of these frankly pathetic answers for this book has ever withstood examination because there is no other answer than the one Joseph gave as its young unlearned translator. In this I stand with my own great-grandfather, who said simply enough, “No wicked man could write such a book as this; and no good man would write it, unless it were true and he were commanded of God to do so.”\\n> \\n> \\n> \\n\\n\\nElder Holland emphasized the significance of the Book of Mormon for those who contemplate leaving the Church. “If\\u202f *anyone*\\u202f is foolish enough or misled enough to reject 531 pages of a heretofore unknown text teeming with literary and Semitic complexity without honestly attempting to account for the origin of those pages . . . then such a person, elect or otherwise, has been deceived; and if he or she leaves this Church, it must be done by crawling over or under or around the Book of Mormon to make that exit.” He concluded with a powerful apostolic witness of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon that stands in effect today.\\n\\n\\n\\n> I ask that my testimony of the Book of Mormon and all that it implies, given today under my own oath and office, be recorded by men on earth and angels in heaven. I hope I have a few years left in my “last days,” but whether I do or do not, I want it absolutely clear when I stand before the judgment bar of God that I declared to the world, in the most straightforward language I could summon, that the Book of Mormon is true, that it came forth the way Joseph said it came forth and was given to bring happiness and hope to the faithful in the travail of the latter days.\\n> \\n> \\n> \\n\\n\\n“Brothers and sisters,” Elder Holland assured, “God always provides safety for the soul, and with the Book of Mormon, He has again done that in our time.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n---------------\\n\\n\\nJeffrey R.

This was especially true at the time of its publication in 1830. People were suspicious of the claim that an ancient book written on golden plates had been revealed to a young farmer. It has taken nearly two centuries of archeological discoveries to fully demonstrate that the details of the buried Nephite record fit in exceptionally well with hidden books from all over the ancient world.\\n\\n\\n### Hidden Records\\n\\n\\nMany passages in the Book of Mormon speak of it and other records being hidden up, often in the earth, in order to come forth to the world at a later time.[1](#footnote1_oniaat1 \"See 1 Nephi 20:6; 2 Nephi 27:12, 22, 26–27; 4 Nephi 1:48–49; Mormon 1:2; 4:23; 5:8, 12; 6:6; 8:4; Ether 4:3, 13, 15; 15:11, 33.

For instance, the *The Cologne Mani Codex* indicates that “an angel brought Enosh to a mountain and instructed him to write on bronze tablets and hide his record.” In Russia, “twelve small gold plates” were reportedly found “in a hill.”[23](#footnote23_buqf9wy \"Tvedtnes, The Book of Mormon and Other Hidden Books, 129.\") In the Masonic tradition, the prophet Enoch “inscribed his revelation on a gold plate that he concealed in a temple he constructed inside a mountain.”[24](#footnote24_ku5ndla \"Tvedtnes, The Book of Mormon and Other Hidden Books, 129.\") And in a number of ancient texts, buried or hidden records or relics were guarded by an angel or some sort of divine power.[25](#footnote25_osum0l8 \"Tvedtnes, The Book of Mormon and Other Hidden Books, 75–108.\")\\n\\n\\nThe large set of documents collectively referred to as the Dead Sea Scrolls were found in caves surrounding the Dead Sea. In ancient Mesoamerica, caves held deep mythological symbolism and were often considered to be sacred.[26](#footnote26_81x5u49 \"See Diane E. Wirth, “Revisiting the Seven Lineages of the Book of Mormon and the Seven Tribes of Mesoamerica,”\\xa0BYU Studies Quarterly\\xa052, no. 4 (2013): 77–88.\") In 2005, Holley Moyes and James Brady noted that “only in the last decade have caves been widely recognized as ritual spaces by Mesoamerican archaeologists. Since caves in Mesoamerica were used almost exclusively for ritual, they provide an unrivaled context for studying pre-Columbian religion.”[27](#footnote27_qozsagy \"Holley Moyes and James E.

Doubled and witnessed legal documents, engraved golden plates, sealed records, stone boxes, sacred hillside repositories, caches of precious relics—all of these things are abundantly attested in antiquity, both archeologically and textually.\\n\\n\\nNot only can such discoveries strengthen our faith in the Book of Mormon, but they can also help us better understand and appreciate it. For instance, in our day it takes only a few moments to digitally upload or download what would have been a virtual *wagonload* of documents in the ancient world! Recognizing that Nephite prophets had to find precious ore, forge their own plates, carefully engrave each character, haul the heavy plates to safe locations, and create durable containers to protect them should increase our gratitude for the sacred writings they recorded and preserved.\\n\\n\\nThe Book of Mormon is a testament to the faith and love of the Nephite prophets. The prophet Enos said he prayed that the Lord “would preserve a record of my people, the Nephites … that it might be brought forth at some future day” ([Enos 1:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.13?lang=eng)). In response, the Lord promised to fulfill this request in His “own due time” (v. [16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.16?lang=eng)). He also revealed to Enos that “Thy fathers have also required of me this thing; and it shall be done unto them according to their faith; for their faith was like unto thine” (v. [18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.18?lang=eng)).\\n\\n\\nThese verses show that the Book of Mormon exists today because ancient prophets were concerned for future generations whom they would never meet in mortality. They truly cared about *us*. In turn, we ought to deeply care about them. Only when we recognize and accept the Book of Mormon as an ancient record can we gain the fullest understanding and appreciation for its sacred messages and the prophets who wrote them.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n---------------\\n\\n\\nJohn A.

People often sense an overwhelming array of choices, not only in religion, but in every facet of life. In ancient Judeo-Christian thought, however, there were only “two ways,” of which Nephi’s two churches are a typological representation.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n“By this reasoning,” writes Hugh Nibley, “there are never more than ‘save two churches only’ in the world, and indeed Nephi’s much-commented remark to that effect ([1 Nephi 14:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14.10?lang=eng#p9)) reads more like a statement of general principle than the denunciation of one particular church among many.”[2](#footnote2_ee8y78x \"Hugh Nibley, An Approach to the Book of Mormon, third edition (Salt Lake City/Provo: Deseret Book and FARMS, 1989), 161.\") Book of Mormon scholar Brant A. Gardner also explains, “The ‘Two Ways’ are the Way of Life and the Way of Death. There is no in-between third way. One chooses either life or death.”[3](#footnote3_m1tq4um \"Brant A. Gardner, Second Witness: Analytical and Contextual Commentary on the Book of Mormon, 6 vols. (Salt Lake City: Greg Kofford Books, 2007–2008), 1: 248. \")\\n\\n\\nThis point is stated most compellingly by the prophet Lehi:\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n> Because [all humans] are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.\\n> \\n> \\n> Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil ([2 Nephi 2:26–27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.26-27?lang=eng#p25)).\\n> \\n> \\n> \\n\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2016/extra/churches/two-paths-400.jpg)](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2016/extra/churches/two-paths.jpg \"We are taught that there are two paths one may follow, the path of life or the path of death\")\\n\\n\\nThe doctrine is also clearly articulated only a few verses before Nephi mentions the two churches (see [1 Nephi 14:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14.7?lang=eng#p6)).[4](#footnote4_alhm323 \"D. John Butler, Plain and Precious Things: The Temple Religion of the Book of Mormon’s Visionary (Lexington, KY: self-published, 2012), 146–147. \")This truth revealed by the Book of Mormon about the fundamental binary nature of this world is not typical of Western thought, but it is deeply embedded in many ancient Israelite texts.\\n\\n\\nOne of Lehi’s contemporaries, Jeremiah, wrote, “Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death” ([Jeremiah 21:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/21.8?lang=eng#p7)). Psalm 1 declares, “For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish” ([Psalm 1:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/1.6?lang=eng#p5)). \\xa0\\n\\n\\nA dramatic example of the doctrine is found in Deuteronomy, where Moses is recorded as saying, \"I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil,\" which the people must choose between: \"I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live.\" ([Deuteronomy 30:15, 19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/30.15,19?lang=eng#p14)).\\n\\n\\nThis teaching is also evident in the Proverbs and the wisdom literature.[5](#footnote5_6mj6xz2 \"See Daniel P. Bricker, “The Doctrine of the ‘Two Ways’ in Proverbs,” Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 38, no. 4 (1995): 501–517.\") Significantly, several scholars have suggested that Lehi and Nephi were strongly influenced by the wisdom tradition of their day, and 1 Nephi 8, 11-14 bear many marks of the wisdom literature.[6](#footnote6_0zae584 \"See Kevin Christensen, “Paradigms Regained: A Survey of Margaret Barker’s Scholarship and Its Significance for Mormon Studies,” FARMS Occasional Papers 2 (2001): 19–21; Kevin Christensen, “The Temple, The Monarchy, and Wisdom: Lehi’s World and the Scholarship of Margaret Barker,” in Glimpses of Lehi’s Jerusalem, ed. John W. Welch, David Rolph Seely, and Jo Ann H. Seely (Provo, UT: FARMS, 2004), 452–457, 488–504.\")\\n\\n\\nThe doctrine of the Two Ways was also strongly present in the Dead Sea Scrolls. For instance, the Community Rule scroll divides people into only two groups: “the Children of Light” and “the Children of Darkness.”[7](#footnote7_16qdubu \"Donald W. Parry and Emanuel Tov, The Dead Sea Scrolls Reader: Volume I, second edition, revised and expanded (Leiden/Boston: Brill, 2013), 3.\")It can also be seen in several early Christian texts from the first through fifth centuries.[8](#footnote8_ow9p9g3 \"Several examples are listed in Gardner, Second Witness, 1: 247–248. \")\\n\\n\\nOne of the clearest expressions of the concept is found in Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, where he taught, “for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat” while “strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it” ([Matthew 7:13–14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/7.13-14?lang=eng#p12)).\\n\\n\\nThe Why\\n-------\\n\\n\\n[![](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2016/extra/churches/last-judgment-michaelangelo-400.jpg)](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2016/extra/churches/last-judgment-michaelangelo.jpg \"The Last Judgment by Michaelangelo forcefully portrays the final division between those who chose the path of eternal life versus those who chose the path of death\")\\n\\n\\nHow are we to understand these stark dichotomies in today’s diverse society? Why is Nephi’s statement ultimately important today? While Nephi spoke of “two churches” or two ways of life, one of those ways leads into a maze of many strange roads and mists of darkness. The Savior spoke of a “broad” way, and Nephi’s great and abominable church is comparable to the great and spacious building of his father’s dream.[9](#footnote9_29uwl5r \"John W. Welch, “Connections Between the Visions of Lehi and Nephi,” in Pressing Forward with the Book of Mormon, ed. John W. Welch and Melvin J. Throne (Provo: FARMS, 1999), 51–52.\") Both the broad way and spacious building suggest room to wander down various paths and hallways while ultimately all ending up in the same place of darkness. Thus, Lehi’s dream mentions the one “strait and narrow path” and in contrast the many “forbidden paths” ([1 Nephi 8:20, 23, 28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.20,23,28?lang=eng#p19)).\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhile Nephi wants all people to understand the wide range of options and paths that exist in the temporal world in which we live, when seen from the perspective of God’s one plan of happiness, mercy, and salvation, the present temporal world is a creation composed of opposites—light and dark, hot and cold, wet and dry, inanimate and animate, male and female, obedient and disobedient, sin and righteousness.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAs Lehi explained, “there is an opposition in all things” ([2 Nephi 2:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11?lang=eng#p10)), and this makes it possible for human beings to learn to choose good and not evil, happiness and not pain, eternal life and incorruption and not corruption and death. This helps all people to see that free choice ultimately boils down to choosing between Christ and Satan. In the end there are really only two choices.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe prophetic world view, sometimes called the apocalyptic worldview, sees the world from this perspective of the end-of-time reality and expresses its urgent messages in terms of a stark dualism, calling people continuously back to the iron rod and to the path that leads to life and the love of God.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n---------------\\n\\n\\nBrant A.

Welch, many people are aware of the idea that chiasmus appears in the Book of Mormon.[1](#footnote1_39yuix8 \"See Robert F. Smith, “Assessing the Broad Impact of Jack Welch\\'s Discovery of Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon,”\\xa0Journal of Book of Mormon Studies, 16, no. 2 (2007): 68–73.\") However, if one assumes that the Book of Mormon was written in another language and translated into English, would one expect that structures like chiasmus would survive translation?[2](#footnote2_9mwh6kn \"For a comprehensive list of proposed chiasms in the Book of Mormon, see “Chiasmus Index,”\\xa0at\\xa0Chiasmus Resources, online at chiasmusresources.org.\")\\n\\n\\nChiastic patterns *do* survive translation, but not all the time. In fact, one reason it is unlikely Joseph Smith was aware of chiasmus is because the pattern is sometimes less obvious in the King James translation than in the original Hebrew or Greek.[3](#footnote3_uiqrewp \"John W. Welch, “Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon,” in Book of Mormon Authorship: New Light on Ancient Origens, ed. Noel B. Reynolds (Provo, UT: Religious Studies Center, 1982), 42, 51 n.3.\") Similarly, Allen J. Christenson, a scholar of Mayan literature, found it difficult to preserve chiastic and other native literary structures in his standard translation of the *Popol Vuh*, compelling him to do a second translation that slavishly follows the native syntax in order to preserve the literary qualities of the text.[4](#footnote4_ep00fbl \"For Christenson’s two translations, see Allen J. Christenson, trans., Popol Vuh: The Sacred Book of the Maya (Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2007); Allen J. Christenson, trans., Popol Vuh: Literal Poetic Version (Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2007). Not all examples of chiasmus and other poetic structures get lost in the free translation. In fact, many do survive—though they undergo some modification and are more obvious in the literal poetic translation.\")\\n\\n\\nStill, chiasmus and other forms of parallelism can and do survive translation into other languages. Chiasms like those found in [Mark 2:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/2.27#26), for example, are evident even in translation. Indeed, as is not the case with many poetical features such as rhyme or meter, chiasm and other forms of parallelism may be the most likely to survive translation. In the Greek translation of the Old Testament, called the Septuagint, the parallels are just about as obvious in the Greek translation as they were in the original Hebrew. In fact, sometimes they were even clearer in Greek than in Hebrew.[5](#footnote5_3gjue9f \"Gerhard Tauberschmidt,\\xa0Secondary Parallelism: A Study of Translation Technique in LXX Proverbs (Atlanta, GA: Society of Biblical Literature, 2004), 12.\") Many skilled translators today make efforts to preserve chiasms and other structural features of texts when rendering them into modern languages.[6](#footnote6_nwdl91s \"Edward F. Campbell Jr.,\\xa0Ruth: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary, Anchor Bible Commentary, Volume 7 (New York, NY: Doubleday, 1975), 62.\")\\n\\n\\nIt is even possible that the “preservation of literary structures” in translation “is arguably more accurate than the vocabulary,”[7](#footnote7_5a8pin8 \"Brant A. Gardner,\\xa0The Gift and Power: Translating the Book of Mormon\\xa0(Salt Lake City, UT: Greg Kofford, 2011), 309.\") for the human mind can easily process patterns and can communicate structures in a way that is not directly connected to language. “The translation of those structures into English clothes [them] … in a modern vocabulary, but … their meaning [is] preserved.”[8](#footnote8_m0nrpnq \"Gardner, Gift and Power, 309.\")\\n\\n\\nTranslation impacts questions of chiasmus in more than one way, however. Just as some patterns can be *lost* in translation, it is possible that others are actually the product of translation. The distribution of chiasmus and other parallel patterns throughout the text, however, does not appear to be random—as would be expected if chiasms were the accidental product of Joseph’s translation efforts. For example, Welch has noted that Helaman through Moroni has fewer chiasms than the rest of the Book of Mormon.[9](#footnote9_up4nwd9 \"John W. Welch, “Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon,” in\\xa0Chiasmus in Antiquity: Structures, Analyses, Exegesis, ed. John W. Welch (Hildesheim: Gerstenberg Verlag, 1981; reprint Provo, UT: Research Press, 1999), 208.\\xa0For the extensive use of chiasmus in Mosiah 2–5, see Book of Mormon Central, “Why Did King Benjamin Use Poetic Parallels So Extensively?\\xa0(Mosiah 5:11),”\\xa0KnoWhy\\xa083 (April 21, 2016).\")\\n\\n\\nCarl Cranny has more recently documented how the presence and absence of chiasmus and other forms of parallelism follows the expected patterns of a genuinely ancient document.[10](#footnote10_2bdexhq \"See Carl J. Cranney, “The Deliberate Use of Hebrew Parallelisms in the Book of Mormon,”\\xa0Journal of Book of Mormon Studies\\xa023 (2014): 140–165.\") If chiasmus were just a result of the translation process, this would not be the case, since Joseph Smith translated the entire book. Therefore, it is unlikely that chiasmus in the Book of Mormon was a result of translation, but was actually something on the plates themselves that survived the translation process.[11](#footnote11_w8aq887 \"Gardner, Gift and Power, 204, similarly concluded: “These structural elements are not random, nor were they part of the common repertoire available to a writer in upstate New York in the 1830s. They represent features of the plate text that have survived the translation process.”\")\\n\\n\\nThe Why\\n-------\\n\\n\\nUnderstanding how chiasmus and other literary features can survive translation offers some insight into the translation process.[12](#footnote12_gl5tlhb \"See Gardner, Gift and Power, 197–204, 239–240.\") As John W. Welch observed:\\n\\n\\n\\n> Evidently, his translation was consistent. Each time a word appeared within a given framework, it seems to have been rendered by the same English word. Otherwise, structures such as [Mosiah 5:10–12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.10-12#9), [Alma 41:13–15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.13-15#12), and others would not have survived through the translation process. … [I]n many cases, it is possible to see that an internally consistent result was produced in the English text, presumably by virtue of a relatively literal and consistent method of translation from the ancient record.[13](#footnote13_2urmak1 \"John W. Welch, “What Does Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon Prove?” in\\xa0Book of Mormon Authorship Revisited: The Evidence for Ancient Origins, ed. Noel B. Reynolds (Provo, UT: FARMS, 1997), 220–221.\")\\n> \\n> \\n> \\n\\n\\nThe realization that chiasmus does not *always* survive translation, however, is also important. Welch lamented, “Of course, it is impossible to know how many other parallelisms or other literary features might have been lost in the translation process.”[14](#footnote14_xnzop4t \"Welch, “What Does Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon Prove?” 220.\") This understanding should make us keenly aware of the limitations we face in studying a translated text, like the Book of Mormon, from a literary perspective. Many elements of ancient texts do not survive translation very well, meaning that we are unable to fully appreciate some of the subtle craftsmanship of the text.[15](#footnote15_caaz8bf \"For more on how chiasmus shows the subtle craftsmanship of the Book of Mormon, see Book of Mormon Central, “Why Was Alma Converted? (Alma 36:21),”\\xa0KnoWhy\\xa0144 (July 15, 2016).\")\\n\\n\\nWhile we may regret the likely loss of some of the literary structure and beauty of the Book of Mormon due to translation, this should not detract from our appreciation of the hundreds of chiasms and other poetic parallelisms that *did* survive and are available for us to study.[16](#footnote16_69cbj7u \"For an example of this, see Donald W. Parry, Poetic Parallelisms in the Book of Mormon: The Complete Text Reformatted (Provo, UT: Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship, 2007). Altogether, Parry displays 1600 examples of 23 different forms of parallelism in the Book of Mormon.\") In fact, to the contrary: it should deepen our appreciation. The survival of chiasmus in the English translation of the Book of Mormon gives us a window into the past and allows modern readers to experience the literary artistry of the ancients almost as though they were reading those texts alongside those ancient writers and in their original languages.[17](#footnote17_uexm1ez \"See Book of Mormon Central, “Why Was Chiasmus Used In Nephite Record Keeping?\\xa0(Helaman 6:10),”\\xa0KnoWhy\\xa0177 (August 31, 2016).\")\\n\\n\\nBeing able to see how these authors used creative patterns to express their ideas allows readers to better relate to them, even if they may, at times, seem far removed from our own time and culture. Moments like these allow the reader to connect with these ancient authors in new and meaningful ways.[18](#footnote18_2ppo5e4 \"Book of Mormon Central, “Why Does the Book of Ether Begin with Such a Long Genealogy? (Ether 1:16),”\\xa0KnoWhy\\xa0235 (November 21, 2016).\") In addition, the preservation of chiasmus in translation allows us to understand the text in a way similar to the way the ancient authors would have understood it.[19](#footnote19_k8nn8oc \"Book of Mormon Central, “Why Is The Presence Of Chiasmus In The Book Of Mormon Significant?\\xa0(Mosiah 5:10–12),”\\xa0KnoWhy\\xa0166 (August 16, 2016).\") This allows the message of the Book of Mormon to come through more clearly and have an impact on us hundreds of years after the text was first written.[20](#footnote20_6pi1nk2 \"This also helps to show how central Christ is to the message of the Book of Mormon.

The principles behind this process are themselves revealed principles. They include “acting in faith, examining concepts and questions with an eternal perspective, and seeking further understanding through divinely appointed sources.”[1](#footnote1_ohcju7l \"See “Acquiring Spiritual Knowledge,” in Doctrinal Mastery: Core Document (Salt Lake City, UT: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2016), online at lds.org.\")\\n\\n\\nNo better companion can be found for understanding the process of acquiring spiritual knowledge than the Book of Mormon, Another Testament of Jesus Christ. Numerous prophetic promises, wise statements, and inspiring stories on almost every page of this revealed book mark the path and model the way that leads to spiritual growth through the Lord Jesus Christ. The first principle that stands out in this sacred record is that of “acting in faith.”\\n\\n\\nThe process of sincerely asking for and willingly receiving spiritual knowledge plays out in numerous Book of Mormon narratives and is the subject of several doctrinal discourses. These narratives often contrast those who righteously sought and successfully obtained spiritual guidance with individuals who relied primarily on their own wisdom and understanding. Other stories show how individuals were transformed from hardened skeptics into righteous seekers of truth.[2](#footnote2_770dp0c \"For further insight into Mormon’s narrative goals, see Book of Mormon Central, “What Was Mormon’s Purpose in Writing the Book of Mormon? (Mormon 5:14),” KnoWhy 230 (November 14, 2016).\")\\n\\n\\nNephi, for instance, discovered when he was still “exceedingly young” that the Lord would personally communicate with him ([1 Nephi 2:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.6)). In contrast to Laman and Lemuel’s murmurings, Nephi “did cry unto the Lord” because he had “great desires to know of the mysteries of God” ([v. 16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.16)). In response to his asking in faith, Nephi said that the Lord “did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father” ([v. 16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.16#15)). Importantly, Nephi’s early inclination to turn to the Lord for confirmation of sacred truths helped him to “not rebel against [his father] like unto [his] brothers” ([v. 16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.16)).\\n\\n\\n[![Zeezrom by James Fullmer](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2017/1/extra/actinfaith/zeezrom-300.jpg \"Zeezrom by James Fullmer\")](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2017/1/extra/actinfaith/zeezrom.jpg \"Zeezrom by James Fullmer\")\\n\\n\\nA similar contrast can be seen between Alma and Amulek and their opponent Zeezrom, who was a lawyer trained “in all the arts and cunning of the people” ([Alma 10:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/10.15#14)).[3](#footnote3_oilqdob \"For more information concerning Zeezrom’s unrighteous approach to truth before his conversion, see Book of Mormon Central, “Why Would Zeezrom Attempt to Bribe Amulek? (Alma 11:22),” KnoWhy 118 (June 9, 2016).\") Zeezrom tried to “question Amulek” in order to “make him cross his words, or contradict the words which he should speak” ([v. 16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/10.16#15)). Yet even with all the learning and training of his people, Zeezrom was confounded by prophets of God, who miraculously “knew the thoughts and intents of his heart” ([Alma 12:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.7#6)).\\n\\n\\nRecognizing the futility of his human wisdom and learning, Zeezrom eventually began to soften his heart and, like Nephi, “inquire … diligently, that he might know more concerning the kingdom of God” ([Alma 12:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.8)). Seeing this miraculous transformation, Alma explained if a man will not harden his heart, he will be “given the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full” ([v. 10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.10)).\\n\\n\\nThis principle is well illustrated in the example of Lamoni’s father, who, like Zeezrom, started out contending against a prophetic messenger. He even tried to slay Ammon because of his prejudice against the Nephites (see [Alma 20:10–20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/20.10-20)). But after discovering “the great love [Ammon] had for his son Lamoni” ([v. 26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/20.26)), he was “desirous to learn” the spiritual truths that Ammon had taught his son ([v. 27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/20.27#26)).\\n\\n\\nIn this humble condition and with a believing heart (see [Alma 22:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.11#10)), Lamoni’s father asked Aaron what he could do to “have this eternal life of which thou hast spoken” ([v. 15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.15#14)). So intent was his pleading for truth that he said he would “give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy” ([v. 15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.15#14)).[4](#footnote4_sy61u6m \"See Book of Mormon Central, “What Did it Mean to be ‘King Over All the Land’? (Alma 20:8),” KnoWhy 128 (June 23, 2016) for further insights about Lamoni’s father and this pivotal altercation.\") Because of his great desire, his willingness to sacrifice, and his sincere humility, Lamoni’s father was able to pray in faith and, like Lamoni himself, receive a miraculous confirmation of spiritual truths.[5](#footnote5_1rnfzqp \"See Book of Mormon Central, “Why Does the Lord Speak to Men ‘According to Their Language’? (2 Nephi 31:3),” KnoWhy 258 (January 6, 2017).\")\\n\\n\\nThese and other Book of Mormon stories aptly demonstrate the foundational principles for receiving revelation.[6](#footnote6_jm2fj2j \"For more examples, see Book of Mormon Central, “Why Must a Trial of Faith Precede a Witness of Spiritual Truth? (Ether 12:6),” KnoWhy 246 (December 6, 2016). For further insights about the revelatory message of the Book of Mormon, see Terryl L. Givens, “The Book of Mormon and Dialogic Revelation,” Journal of Book of Mormon Studies 10, no. 2 (2001): 16–27, 69–70; Elder Jeffrey R.

Tate Jr. (Provo, UT: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1988), 315–323.\") Not only does the Lord require that inquirers ask, seek, and knock ([3 Nephi 14:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/14.7#6)), but they must sincerely ask in faith, willingly seek in humility, and genuinely knock with real intent.[7](#footnote7_12le0yw \"See Book of Mormon Central, “How Will God Manifest the Truth of the Book of Mormon? (Moroni 10:4),” KnoWhy 254 (December 16, 2016).\") Only in this condition—with a softened heart—can revelation flow into the minds and hearts of those who seek it.\\n\\n\\nApplication\\n-----------\\n\\n\\n[![Nefi ora con liahona by Jorge Cocco](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2017/1/extra/actinfaith/nefi-liahona-300.jpg \"Nefi ora con liahona by Jorge Cocco\")](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2017/1/extra/actinfaith/nefi-liahona.jpg \"Nefi ora con liahona by Jorge Cocco\")\\n\\n\\nThese precious accounts in the Book of Mormon reveal how the process of acquiring spiritual knowledge works. They demonstrate how crucial it is to not become hardened or skeptical toward revelation. Those who never soften their hearts in the first place won’t obtain the foundational testimony needed to guide them to eternal life.[8](#footnote8_cdxu3sl \"Alma described this potentiality when giving his famous sermon on faith. He explained that the seed (the word of God) would only begin to grow within the heart “if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord” (Alma 32:28). Jesus also warned of this possibility in the parable of the sower (see Matthew 13:19).\") And those who, after receiving a testimony, begin to treat the process of acquiring spiritual truths flippantly or without faith may soon discover that “the gospel isn’t working so well” for them.[9](#footnote9_mnzd6ci \"President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “It Works Wonderfully!” Ensign, November 2015, 23, online at lds.org.\")\\n\\n\\nThe reality of this truth is symbolized in many places in the Book of Mormon, as in the story of the Liahona. This miraculous device was given to Lehi and his family to help them journey through the wilderness and cross the ocean toward the promised land. Like the Holy Ghost, the Liahona’s main purpose was to simply “point the way they should go” ([Alma 37:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.40)). It didn’t tell them everything about what was ahead or how their journey would proceed, but instead prompted them to act on faith with only a limited amount of information.\\n\\n\\nYet, as Alma reported, because that miracle took place “by small means,” members of Lehi’s family sometimes became “slothful, and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence” ([Alma 37:41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.41#40)). When this happened, the Liahona’s “marvelous works ceased,” the party “did not progress in their journey,” and they “were afflicted with hunger and thirst, because of their transgressions” ([vv. 41–42](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.41-42#40)).[10](#footnote10_tty58p0 \"See Joseph Fielding McConkie and Robert L. Millet, Doctrinal Commentary on the Book of Mormon, 4 vols. (Salt Lake City, UT: Bookcraft, 1991), 3:282: “Thus the Liahona was a symbol of their faithfulness, a visible evidence of their standing before God.” Likewise, the companionship of the Holy Ghost—or the lack thereof—can be a meaningful indication of one’s standing before the Lord.\") These hardships demonstrate the negative effects of forgetting or disregarding the revelatory power of the Holy Ghost.\\n\\n\\nThe good news of the gospel is that as often as followers of Christ continue to keep their covenants and act on faith, they will receive consistent spiritual direction. From time to time, this direction will take the form of more direct and clear revelation, such as the words written on the pointers of the Liahona ([1 Nephi 16:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.29#28)). Most frequently, however, this guidance will come through subtle promptings and impressions, more analogous to the Liahona’s pointers which directed Lehi’s party “day by day” as long as they were faithful ([Alma 37:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.40#39)).[11](#footnote11_ggj89ub \"For an explanation of how the Holy Ghost usually guides through the still small voice (promptings and impressions), see Elder Dallin H. Oaks, “In His Own Time, In His Own Way,” Ensign, August 2013, 24–25, online at lds.org. Concerning the distinction between revelation and inspiration, see Elder Richard G. Scott, “How to Obtain Revelation and Inspiration for Your Personal Life,” Ensign, May 2012, 45, online at lds.org: “The Holy Ghost communicates important information that we need to guide us in our mortal journey. When it is crisp and clear and essential, it warrants the title of revelation. When it is a series of promptings we often have to guide us step by step to a worthy objective, for the purpose of this message, it is inspiration.”\")\\n\\n\\nWhether guided by miraculous revelation or by subtle inspiration, Elder Richard G.

Scott, “He lives,” Ensign, November 1999, online at lds.org.\") As individuals faithfully and obediently seek for spiritual guidance and direction, the Holy Ghost, and the Book of Mormon itself, can act as a personal Liahona to guide them step by step, line upon line, in keeping their own lives along the path that leads to eternal life and happiness.[13](#footnote13_e48qgxu \"See Neal Elwood Lambert, “Liahona,” in Book of Mormon Reference Companion, ed.

The reported weight, dimensions, and composition of the plates are believable. The story of their discovery is supported by a large number of similar archeological finds. And several of the record’s unusual features—such as being bound by D-shaped rings, having a sealed portion, and being written in reformed Egyptian—have a surprising amount of corroboration from the ancient world. Each reported detail, no matter how unusual or unlikely from a 19th century perspective, has checked out in light of 20th and 21st century research.\\n\\n\\nNeal Rappleye has noted that, in many cases, the eyewitnesses who provided these consistent details did so “after their estrangement from Joseph, independently and spontaneously upon questioning and cross-examination (sometimes from skeptical interviewers), during a time when [they] were scattered and isolated from each other, when no collusion was possible.”[22](#footnote22_bo1m40q \"Rappleye, “‘Idle and Slothful Strange Stories’,” 35.\") Recognizing that so many independent witnesses firmly ground the plates in reality, some people have assumed that Joseph Smith or one of his associates simply forged them. Yet those who resort to this theory often fail to account for the metallurgical expertise required to create such an object.[23](#footnote23_9ruricp \"See Shanna Butler, “A Golden Opportunity,”\\xa0New Era\\xa0(February 2006): 34–37; “A Model of the Plates,” made by Steven Pratt, online at lds.org.\")\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[![Joseph Smith Receives the Gold Plates by Kenneth Riley](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/users/user19/moroni-joseph-smith-plates_ver.jpg)](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/users/user19/moroni-joseph-smith-plates.jpg \"Joseph Smith Receives the Gold Plates by Kenneth Riley\")\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoseph Smith Receives the Gold Plates by Kenneth Riley\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhoever made the plates would have needed to be competent in hammering, gilding, annealing, smelting, and engraving metal records.[24](#footnote24_howj9h5 \"See Read H. Putnam, “Were the Golden Plates made of Tumbaga?” The Improvement Era 69, no. 9 (1966): 788.\") They would have needed familiarity with the properties of gold, copper, and perhaps silver.[25](#footnote25_pcjx17c \"Silver was sometimes, although not always, added to gold and copper in the tumbaga alloy. See Putnam, “Were the Golden Plates made of Tumbaga?” 789. Also, Martin Harris remarked that the rings which bound the plates were made of silver. See Henrichsen, “How Witnesses Described the ‘Gold Plates’,” 19.\") They would have needed a good deal of time to create the object, presumably in secret. And, most unlikely of all, they would have needed a large amount of gold! Yet, the historical record suggests that neither Joseph Smith nor any of his associates would have had the competence or the materials to pull off such a scheme.[26](#footnote26_tlow1e9 \"See William J.

If Joseph Smith never possessed them, then the foundation of Mormonism is built upon a hoax.[27](#footnote27_teprxaa \"See Tad R. Callister, “The Book of Mormon—a Book from God,” Ensign, November 2011, online at lds.org: “Joseph Smith declared that an angel of God directed him to gold plates, which contained the writings of prophets in ancient America, and that he translated those plates by divine powers. If that story is true, then the Book of Mormon is holy scripture, just as it professes to be; if not, it is a sophisticated but, nonetheless, diabolical hoax.” \") Yet if he actually did possess an ancient record, then his claims of translating it through divine power are significantly supported. It seems that for this very reason, the Lord has provided profound physical and spiritual evidences for the existence of the plates.[28](#footnote28_6cpcrcm \"The Three Witnesses’ experienced a supernatural, although completely discernable and describable experience with the plates and other Nephite relics. In vision, they saw the angel who first delivered them into Joseph Smith’s possession. The angel presented the artifacts before their eyes. And they heard a voice from heaven confirming the truthfulness of the translation of the plates. In contrast, the experience of the Eight Witnesses was strictly natural. Under completely ordinary circumstances, they were each allowed to touch and heft the plates for themselves. Literary scholar Terryl Givens has explained, “Taken together, the two experiences seemed calculated to provide an evidentiary spectrum, satisfying a range of criteria for belief.” Terryl L. Givens, By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture that Launched a New World Religion (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2002), 40.\") According to Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, both types of evidence are important because “truly rock-ribbed faith and uncompromised conviction comes with its most complete power when it engages our head as well as our heart.”[29](#footnote29_pjg7lpt \"See Jeffrey R.

They contained the most important spiritual messages from an ancient civilization, recorded and preserved by prophets over the course of a thousand years. For this reason, their contents are far more valuable than the precious metals from which they were created.[30](#footnote30_blxwych \"See Mormon 8:14. \") Yet the evidence for their tangible reality helps confirm the historical reality of the ancient prophets who created them, as well as the true doctrines and miraculous experiences which they recorded.[32](#footnote32_ngg9lxp \"See Paul Y.

(2 Nephi 31:6–7),” KnoWhy 59 (March 22, 2016).\") In that KnoWhy, we cited emeritus BYU Professor Noel B. Reynolds as asserting that for Nephi and subsequent Book of Mormon figures, baptism principally serves as an outward sign witnessing our repentant commitment to follow Jesus Christ. In contrast to baptism being a symbol of spiritual cleansing, Reynold’s notes, “the Book of Mormon consistently points to a different symbolism: the making of a covenant.” We are then cleansed by the purifying fire of the Holy Ghost ([3 Nephi 12:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.2?lang=eng#p1)).[2](#footnote2_dftnb0x \"Noel B.

If baptism, in the Book of Mormon, is understood as a sign that one has made a covenant with God to do certain things, what are those things? What is God, for His part, promising to do? The narrative of Alma (the elder) baptizing believers at the waters of Mormon in [Mosiah 18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng) is one of the most informative accounts of what was expected of newly baptized saints.\\n\\n\\n[![Alma Baptizes in the Waters of Mormon by Minerva Teichert](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2016/5/extra/baptismcovenant/teichert-alma-baptizes-400.jpg \"Alma Baptizes in the Waters of Mormon by Minerva Teichert\")](/sites/default/files/knowhy-img/2016/5/extra/baptismcovenant/teichert-alma-baptizes.jpg \"Alma Baptizes in the Waters of Mormon by Minerva Teichert\")\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n> \"And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are *desirous to come into the fold of God*, and to *be called his people*, and are *willing to bear one another’s burdens*, that they may be light; Yea, and are *willing to mourn with those that mourn*; yea, and *comfort those that stand in need of comfort*, and to *stand as witnesses of God* at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life—Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that *ye will serve him and keep his commandments*, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?\" ([Mosiah 18:8–10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8-10?lang=eng#p7), emphasis added).\\n> \\n> \\n> \\n\\n\\nThis passage concisely indicates that baptized believers make a covenant to do the following:\\n\\n\\n* Come into the fold of God\\n* Be called his people\\n* Bear one another’s burdens\\n* Mourn with those who mourn\\n* Comfort those who need comfort\\n* Stand as a witness of God at all times and places\\n* Serve God and\\n* Keep his commandments\\n\\nAt the same time, God promises to:\\n\\n\\n* Redeem them\\n* Number them with those of the first resurrection\\n* Give eternal life\\n* Pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon them.\\n\\nThe Why\\n-------\\n\\n\\nMembers of the Church are often admonished to remember the sacred covenants they have made with the Lord.

The account of Alma baptizing believers in [Mosiah 18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng) also draws us into the underlying theme of the atonement and asks us to imitate Christ’s infinite charity. As BYU professors of religious education, D. Kelly Ogden and Andrew C. Skinner, have noted:\\n\\n\\n\\n> Embedded in Alma’s description of our responsibilities regarding the baptismal covenant is the essence of the Atonement—to suffer vicariously the pains of others and provide them comfort.
