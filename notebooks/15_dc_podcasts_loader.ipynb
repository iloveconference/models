      "     The first time the story of Joseph Smith’s First Vision was ever printed was in a pamphlet written by Apostle Orson Pratt and published in Scotland while Pratt was on a mission there in 1840. Two years later, in 1842, a non-Latter-day Saint newspaper editor named John Wentworth solicited Joseph Smith to write his own story about the rise and progress of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Joseph’s response became known as the Wentworth Letter and contained his fourth and final firsthand telling of his First Vision experience. What’s especially intriguing about this 1842 account is how much Joseph drew upon the language of Orson Pratt’s original 1840 pamphlet to tell about his own experience, which includes personal details not found in his previous tellings of the vision. And, in addition to influencing the language of Joseph’s 1842 account, Pratt’s pamphlet also heavily influenced another insightful telling of Joseph’s vision, written by his fellow apostle Orson Hyde, which was published in Germany in 1842. Today on Church History Matters, we explore each of these three accounts and their unique contributions to our understanding of Joseph’s first visionary experience. I’m Scott Woodward, a Managing Director at Scripture Central, and my co-host is Casey Griffiths, also a Managing Director at Scripture Central. Thanks for joining us today. Let’s get into it.\n",

Today we’re going to be talking about Joseph Smith’s last account of the First Vision that he writes himself and a couple others that may have influenced it by Orson Pratt and Orson Hyde. But first, let’s do a quick recap on what we’ve already covered. So Scott, take it away.\n",

      "   <p>\n",
      "    Scott Woodward:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    All right. Yes. Well, if you’ve made it with us this far in the series, then you know that we have been talking about Joseph Smith’s First Vision as a foundational narrative of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We’ve talked about how it’s grown in institutional significance over time, right, meaning that its significance for members of the church and for how we tell the narrative of church history has continued to gain importance and central significance. We’ve been talking about Joseph’s own efforts to record his First Vision experience. There’s essentially four firsthand accounts, right? 1832, 1835, 1838, and 1842. And what we’ve been trying to do is, first, explain the context in which each account was written, and then, second, to look at the unique elements of each account, right, and then, third, to highlight how the context helps illuminate the content. And so in our first episode of this series we talked about the context of the 1832 account as being written as a result, or at least in part a result, of some reflective, soul-searching time that Joseph spent in a grove in Greenville, Indiana that year, and we highlighted how this highly personal context explains perfectly why this account includes so many personal details about Joseph’s inner world, his feelings, his thoughts, his reflections, at the time of the First Vision. It’s definitely our most personal account. And then in our second episode, last time, we discussed both the 1835 and 1838 accounts. We talked about how the context of the 1835 account is that it was written as a journal entry by one of Joseph’s scribes, recounting a conversation he had in Kirtland, Ohio with an eccentric visitor who called himself Joshua and styled himself as a Jewish prophet. Before Joseph learned more about the man and eventually made the connection that he was actually a guy who’d been tried for murder and manslaughter and child abuse, Joseph had actually shared with him an account of his First Vision, and the contextual fact that Joseph was explaining his experience to a stranger explains very well why this account focuses on objective details with little personal feelings, right? A big contrast to the 1832 account. Also, the contextual fact that Joseph initially believed the man was a Jew explains very well why Joseph de-emphasized some things, like the more Christian cultural aspects of his experience, like the revivals and his search for the true Christian church. In fact, he says in that account that he had been looking into, “different systems of religion.” It also explains why he would emphasize the more Jewish-friendly aspects of the vision, such as his ordeal—we talked about his ordeal, the wrestle with dark power; the pillar of fire with those shekhinah overtones, cloud by day, pillar of fire by night that Jews would have been familiar with; and the many angels that he mentioned, the only account that mentions angels is this, where he’s talking to a Jew, a nod to the divine counsel that Jews would be familiar with. And then, as for the 1838 account, we discussed how this account was written as part of Joseph’s official history, a project that he had just started that year, shortly after he and his family had arrived in Far West, Missouri. And the reason, the reason they had just moved to Far West was to escape serious persecution that they had been experiencing in Kirtland. Influential apostates from the church and others, other Christian folk, had been threatening Joseph. Some death threats had come to him that January. Now, persecution’s not particularly new to Joseph or the church at this time, but it had recently become quite intense. It had been ratcheted up several notches, and the rumors and the slander from their foes were not helping with public relations, right? This is only going to lead to additional persecution. And so it’s in that context, in 1838, that this account was written, intentionally written, with the help of some of Joseph’s right hand men, to set the record straight, right? To—his language was to, “put all inquirers after truth into possession of the facts in relation both to myself and the church,” right? We want you to get the facts, and we want you to get it from us. And I think that context explains extraordinarily well why this account is so factually detailed in terms of time and weather and exact quotations, and why Joseph goes to such extents here to go deeply into the Christian elements of his experience.\n",

      "    Those who’d been persecuting him were all Christian at this time, right? And so Joseph wants Christians everywhere to know how biblically based this experience was that he had, and he would like them to therefore stop persecuting us, thank you very much. He also provides—and I think you emphasized this very well last time, Casey—that he’s also providing a pattern for how he came to know the truth of these things for himself, perhaps as kind of a tacit model for those of his readers to go and do likewise if they have questions about this church. Look, this is how I came to an understanding of the truth, and so, instead of fighting against us, how about you do as James directs as well and ask the Lord about this? So anyway, that’s kind of a recap, I think, of where we’ve been so far. Anything you’d add to that?\n",

      "    John Wentworth is the editor of a newspaper called the Chicago Democrat, who apparently solicited Joseph Smith for a sketch of the rise, progress, persecution, and faith of the Latter-day Saints. Now, this history itself was never published by Wentworth, and we don’t actually have the original letter that is the Wentworth Letter, and the Joseph Smith Papers Project did a little bit of sleuthing and found out that Wentworth may not have intended to publish it to begin with. He was asking on behalf of a friend from Boston named George Barstow, who was preparing a history of the state of New Hampshire. And Joseph Smith has ties to New Hampshire, his family’s there for a little while, and he also knew that a history that was going to be published nationally would be a good way for the church to get itself out there, to provide some background on where we come from and tell our own story. So even if John Wentworth doesn’t publish it, and neither does George Barstow, Joseph Smith publishes it, and it’s published just under the title “Church History” in the Times and Seasons, 1842, March 1st.\n",

So he ends at 1819, and since the Latter-day Saint church had not been established until 1830, that was his justification for not including what Joseph had written in his history.\n",

So this one is more of a self-contained, brief narrative where Joseph really, really quickly and really efficiently goes over his early life, the First Vision, the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, Moroni, the founding of the church, and then the Standard of Truth—I think a lot of people out there would be familiar with the Standard of Truth.

And it’s a great, succinct history that covers all the big stuff up to the organization of the church and has some of Joseph Smith’s best language in it. And, like I said, there’s a reason why it’s probably a little bit more polished than other things Joseph wrote, too, because it appears that this was probably written in collaboration with Orson Pratt, who had already published a similar history, and Joseph just kind of draws from it and uses a lot of similar phraseology to describe what happened. He’s got something that already works. I mean, I was a curriculum writer for the church, and when they asked us to write something new, the first question always was, “Do we already have something that could just do this?”\n",

      "    And it’s going to talk to us about the factionality of Christianity, right? It’s going to emphasize the visionary qualities of the experience. He mentions—let me quote a little bit here from the account. He—this is kind of new language. He says that when he had been praying fervently in the grove, he said, “My mind was taken away from the objects with which I was surrounded, and I was enwrapped in a heavenly vision and saw two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other in features and likeness.” He hasn’t used this kind of language prior to this. This is interesting, that his mind was “taken away from the objects with which I was surrounded,” and then he mentions that these two beings exactly resembled each other in features and likeness. I think that’s one unique aspect of this.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Casey Paul Griffiths:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    I think that “features and likeness” observation that he makes there, too, is maybe an olive branch to traditional Christianity. I mean, at this point, saying that they’re two separate beings could be something that’s upsetting to some Christians. But to say, well, they precisely resembled each other, you know? That their unity isn’t just metaphysical, you know? It’s literal. They look like each other. They’re a literal father and son pairing. May have been a way of trying to reach out to Christians and say, yeah, what I saw was a unified pair that talked to me together. But again, this one, shortest message, too, he says, “They told me that all religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines, and none of them was acknowledged of God as His church and His kingdom, and I was expressly commanded to go not after them.” And so he doesn’t pull his punches, you know? He still is saying, the message to me was that the churches weren’t God’s kingdom. He doesn’t say that the churches were evil. This one’s maybe a little bit softer than 1838 where the creeds are an abomination and the ministers draw near to me with their lips but their hearts are far from me, but just a simple acknowledgement that every religious denomination had a few things that were wrong and that none of them was the church that Jesus had founded. So, like I said, I see it as an olive branch to basically say to people, we’re not saying that your church is the kingdom of the devil, or anything like that, we’re saying that over time, incorrect doctrines have crept into Christianity, and that the authority that was originally invested in the ancient church is gone, that it’s not there anymore, and so he says, “I was given a promise that the fullness of the gospel should at some future time be made known unto me.”\n",

He says none of the churches were acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom, but this isn’t all about doom and gloom and despair. He was promised that the gospel fulness would at some future time be made known to him. And let me tell you about what happened next, right? And so this is, in a way, a missionary text.\n",

For instance, in this one, when he describes translation, he gives the exact dimensions of the plates. The plates were this tall, this wide, this long. Three rings that bound them together. Then he describes the Urim and Thummim at length, and how he used the Urim and Thummim to translate. He’s taking into account things that the public might be interested in. And so it’s similar to 1838 in that he knows, I’ve got to get the facts pinned down here. So he probably sat down and said, gosh, how big were the plates? What was going on when the vision was received? What was the message that I was given? But it does seem like he adjusts the message a little bit so it’s not quite as confrontational as the 1838 account is. At this point he’s two years away from running for president, you know? And Latter-day Saints have built a pretty nice city and are being seen with a little bit more respectability. There’s a Masonic Lodge opening in Nauvoo. And so this is a very confident account of the First Vision. I mean, part of the polish here, too, might be that this one’s intrinsically linked to another account of the First Vision, which is actually the first published account of the First Vision. So we noted how Joseph Smith writes one privately in 1832, he has a conversation that’s recorded in ’35, starts on his history in 1838, and then in 1842 published it in the newspaper. But the first time that the story of the First Vision appears in print is Orson Pratt’s account—\n",

Pratt, actually joins the church before him and explicitly, like, makes a beeline for Canaan, New York, which is where Orson was, and tells him about the restored gospel. At 19 years old, Orson Pratt joins the church, is baptized by his older brother Parley. Shortly thereafter, it was, I think, maybe six weeks after his baptism, he meets Joseph Smith, [who] receives D&amp;C 34 on his behalf. When he’s 23 years old he is appointed to be part of the newly organized Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. This is 1835. And then with the Quorum of the Twelve, he’s going to serve a mission to the British Isles from 1840 to 1841. This is that time period when he’s going to publish this account. So he’s an apostle, and he had traveled, actually, to the eastern United States to get on the boat to go to the British Isles. He had stopped for a number of weeks there in the East, preparing to leave, and Joseph Smith actually happened to be in the East as well, petitioning the federal government for a redress for the Latter-day Saint Missouri losses. And so Orson Pratt’s going to attend some speeches that Joseph Smith delivered during his stay in the East, and he’s going to accompany him on a little journey from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania over to Monmouth, New Jersey in December 1839. So we know right before Orson Pratt leaves from the East Coast to the British Isles, he’s spending some significant time with Joseph.\n",

This is a lengthy history that contains a lot of specifics, too, about the plates, the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. It comes from a good source. And again, I can’t emphasize enough, Orson Pratt was a polyglot. Like, he was good at a lot of things. He was good at mathematics. He was good at writing.

In fact, Brigham Young said, “If Brother Orson were chopped up into one-inch bits, every one would cry out that Mormonism is true.” So this is best-case scenario, you know, a person telling the story who’s got the skills and the intellect to really write it well, and I think this is one of the great accounts of the First Vision, one that shouldn’t be overlooked just because it doesn’t come directly from Joseph Smith.

When the person who the experience happened to quotes a guy to tell his own story, that’s a nod. That’s really good.

And then Joseph will use his own unique language to talk about how there was a clash in religious sentiment going on, and if I went to one society they said one thing, and if I went to another, they pointed to their own particular creed as the summum bonum of perfection. That’s all Joseph’s own language. But then, as you go down a little bit, it happens again. Orson Pratt says, “He therefore retired to a secret place in a grove but a short distance from his father’s house and knelt down and began to call upon the Lord.” Joseph will shorten that, using similar phrases.

Was he sorting through his feelings?\n",

For instance, when he talks about Joseph going into the grove, and he begins to call upon the Lord, Orson says this: “At first he was severely tempted by the powers of darkness, which endeavored to overcome him.” That sounds like the 1838 account, 1835 account. “But he continued to seek for deliverance until darkness gave way from his mind. He was enabled to pray in fervency of the Spirit and in faith, and while thus pouring out his soul, anxiously desiring an answer from God, he at length saw a very bright and glorious light in the heavens above, which at first seemed to be at a considerable distance.” These details are fascinating.\n",

Therefore, there might be some hope he might survive. I mean, these are all details that only Joseph could have known and told his trusted friend and fellow apostle Orson.\n",

And so then he was enwrapped in a heavenly vision and saw the two glorious personages. So yeah, that is—it’s difficult. What language should we use? He uses the word vision here, but that’s only after the light touched him. Orson puts it as the moment the vision began was when the light touched him. It’s a great account. So detailed.

      "    This one’s from another Orson: Orson Hyde. He’s another original member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Orson Hyde has an interesting story, too. He’s a convert from the Kirtland area, one of Sidney Rigdon’s close associates. He is excommunicated before he writes his account of the First Vision, but according to his biographer has a vision of the Sons of Perdition that puts the fear of God in him enough that he comes back into the church and then volunteers to go on a 6,000-mile journey to Jerusalem to dedicate the Holy Land, has all kinds of adventures along the way, and in 1842 in Germany publishes—I’m not going to try and say the German. I will try. “Ein Ruf aus der Wüste,” which translates as “a cry out of the wilderness.” This one is also really heavily influenced by Orson Pratt’s. I’m guessing he had a copy of Orson’s with him. But he translates it into German. In fact, if you pull it up on the JSP site, they’ll still just have the original German page there. But they have the excerpt where the First Vision is described translated into English so you can see it. A couple things that he emphasizes here: so, starts out by describing at length, because his parents were poor and had to feed a large family, his education was meager. He was able to read fairly well, but his ability to write was very limited, and he had only very literary knowledge. His knowledge of letters did not go any further. Most of the subjects were generally taught in the United States of America were completely unknown to him at the time he received this heavenly message. So he really goes out of his way to emphasize that Joseph Smith is not a religious scholar: that he’s a young man who is disadvantaged who comes from the backwoods. And then one interesting thing that he adds here has to do with the darkness, the demonic attack that happens before the First Vision. This is unique to Orson Hyde’s account. “On one occasion he went to a small grove of trees,” this is what he writes, “near his father’s home and knelt down before God in solemn prayer. The adversary then made several strenuous efforts to cool his ardent soul. He filled his mind with doubts and brought to mind all manner of inappropriate images to prevent him from obtaining the object of his endeavors.” That’s probably as specific as any of the accounts get about what was actually going on with Joseph.\n",

And a colleague of mine at BYU named Andy Reed has done some good work on Orson because Andy’s background is in Jewish studies, and Orson has the strongest connection to Jewish people because he actually goes to the Holy Land. In fact, right on the Mount of Olives, Orson Hyde Memorial Gardens were dedicated back in the 1970s to recognize that Orson came there and dedicated the holy land years and years before the state of Israel’s founded and people start moving there, so two good folks.

Not too long before Brigham Young passed, he met with the entire Quorum of the Twelve and basically said, I’m going to reorganize seniority based on continuous service. And he tells Orson Hyde and Orson Pratt that because they were both excommunicated, their seniority reset, and John Taylor was going to be president of the church. Now, I could be wrong on this, but I don’t think there was any murmuring or jealousy from the two Orsons, even though they were in line to lead the church, and obviously we needed John Taylor during that really difficult period when the persecution surrounding plural marriage kind of reaches its apex, so—\n",

      "     Hi. This is Scott from Church History Matters. As we near the end of this series, we want to hear your questions about Joseph Smith’s First Vision. Next week we will be honored to have with us a special guest, Dr. Steven C. Harper, a church historian and scholar of the First Vision, to help us respond to your questions. So you can record yourself asking your question anytime up to March 29, 2023. That’s tomorrow if you’re listening to this on today’s episode’s release date. And send it in to info@scripturecentral.org. Let us know your name, where you’re from, and try to keep it to about 20 seconds or so. Also, please transcribe your question when you email it in. That helps out a lot. Okay. Now on to the episode. Thousands of people heard Joseph Smith’s testimony firsthand. Some of those testimonies included him telling about his First Vision experience, and some of those people who heard his witness wrote down the details of what they heard. Luckily, a few of those accounts have survived until today, and some of them contain even more details about Joseph’s vision, which add to our understanding of what happened in 1820 in the Sacred Grove in Palmyra, New York. Today on Church History Matters, we explore three of these secondhand accounts, and then one bonus thirdhand account, which contains a significant detail that no other account ever mentions. I’m Scott Woodward, a Managing Director at Scripture Central, and my co-host is Casey Griffiths, also a Managing Director at Scripture Central. This is our fourth episode in this series dealing with Joseph Smith’s First Vision. Now, let’s get into it.\n",

And what we’ve been trying to do is first to explain the context in which each account was written and then to look at the unique elements of each account and then, third, to highlight how the context helps illuminate the content, right? Why would Joseph say that, or why would he withhold certain details or facts based on the people to whom he’s speaking? And so should we try this? Should we try to do a quick—how fast do you think we can recap this?\n",

      "    So this is written—it’s a journal entry from one of Joseph’s scribes. Joseph had a conversation with a really interesting fellow, an odd duck, a visitor who’d just come into Kirtland named Joshua. He had styled himself as a Jewish prophet, and before Joseph learned that he was actually, like, a guy who’d been tried for murder and manslaughter and child abuse, Joseph had shared with him an account of his First Vision. The two, I think, most important and interesting things about the context on this one were first, that this is to a stranger, and I think that accounts well for why Joseph focuses on objective details with very little personal feeling, right, in contrast to 1832 account. And the second, I think, important historical context is that Joseph understood that he was talking to a Jew.\n",

      "    Which explains why he de-emphasized the more Christian cultural aspects of his experience, like the revivals and the search for the true Christian church, right? He just talked about looking for different systems of religion, right? And it also, I think, highlights why he, why he highlights more Jewish-friendly aspects of the vision, like his wrestle with darkness, this ordeal, and pillar of fire. That’s the only account he uses fire, and that’s very Old Testament, shekhinah-type language. The many angels, he mentions the many angels in this account, which is a nod to the divine counsel. So ’35 is interesting because it’s to a Jewish stranger. Okay, how about ’38? You want to do a ’38?\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Casey Paul Griffiths:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    ’38 is the one most people are familiar with. It’s the canonized accounts found in the Pearl of Great Price. It happens in the midst of serious persecution, both internal and external. Joseph Smith has fled from Kirtland because of internal problems, gets to Missouri where there’s external problems happening, and so it has kind of a defensive tone. I’m telling this to let people know exactly what happened, to put inquirers after the truth into possession of the facts. Joseph goes into a lot of things about grounding his experiences in the Bible. It also presents a good model for how any seeker can find the truth themselves, that you study the scriptures, ask God, expect opposition, but God will speak to you and give you the answer, and then you can expect opposition again, because another thing the 1838 account emphasizes is the reception of the First Vision, that Joseph Smith went and told a clergyman about it and didn’t really get the nicest response. So it’s the one most people are familiar with, and probably the most polished of the First Vision accounts, because Joseph Smith has several people help him with it when he’s writing.\n",

      "    Excellent. Okay, 1842. That was our last episode. We talked about that this account comes because of an invitation of a non-Latter-day-Saint newspaper editor named John Wentworth. And so he asked Joseph to compose a sketch of the rise and progress and persecution and faith of Latter-day Saints. Wentworth actually was requesting his history on behalf of his friend George Barstow, who was then preparing a history of the state of New Hampshire. But in Wentworth’s request, Joseph seemed to sense an opportunity to capitalize on the growing national interest in the church.\n",

      "    <br/>\n",
      "    So this time Joseph is more bold and confident than ever, and that, I think, explains the real self-assured, straightforward, matter-of-fact tone of this account. You know, for example, he’ll say that none of the churches were acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom. I think that’s pretty bold to say. But he was promised that the fulness of the gospel should at some future time be made known to him. And the fact that this is to a genuinely interested but non-LDS audience signals this missionary nature of the text, right? This is very much a missionary text.\n",

      "    Pratt’s was already a polished, concise, informative telling of the details of Joseph’s experience, and it was already calibrated as a missionary text, and so I just think it’s real interesting that 1842 is actually intended as a missionary text, but we often will quote from 1838 as missionaries. It could be used, of course, as a missionary text, 1838, but ’42 was, like, deliberately written in that way, so . . .\n",

Orson Pratt’s is published in Scotland. It’s actually the first published account of the First Vision. Orson Hyde’s is published in Germany, has to be translated from German, but you can found it at the Joseph Smith Papers site. And with that lead-in, today we’re going to be talking about some other secondary accounts of the First Vision. Orson Pratt and Orson Hyde are the most famous. But we’ve picked a couple here. We didn’t pick all of them, because there’s actually a lot more than you think once you start digging into it, but most of them are just brief references to Joseph testified that he’d seen the Father and the Son. These ones are ones that contain details and that came from someone—we made one exception—that heard it directly from Joseph Smith himself, but wrote it down.\n",

Levi is one of those people that pops up a lot in early church history but isn’t well-known. He is the older brother of Willard Richards, who’s a member of the Quorum of the Twelve and a member of the First Presidency. And Levi was in the middle of things. In Nauvoo, he’s a member of the Council of Fifty. He is a member of the Anointed Quorum. That’s the group that receives the temple ordinances first.\n",

So he’s true blue, through and through, all the way Latter-day Saint, but he does record some interesting details about the First Vision that we don’t see other places and that might be interesting, given the context that this happens in Nauvoo. So, Scott, you want to tell us a little bit about his account and what he says?\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Scott Woodward:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah, you bet. So this comes from his own history, his own journal, on the 11th of June, 1843. In fact, I talked to Andrew Ehat, who’s done a ton of research. He put together a fantastic book called The Words of Joseph Smith, kind of recollections of people in Nauvoo, their written accounts of Joseph’s sermons. I actually gave a presentation once about this account, or this was a heavy piece of my presentation, and I didn’t know that Andy Ehat was actually in the audience, and he came up afterwards and he said, “Hey, so you like that account I found?” And I said, “You found this?” He said, “Yeah.” He said, “Yeah, that was a gem.” I can’t remember where he told me he found it, but he was excited that it was being used and that we’re talking about it. I’ll just read a little bit of an excerpt from it. He says he attended a meeting at the temple. The weather was very fine, warm. And then Joseph Smith preached from Matthew. And then another guy got up and preached from the Hebrews chapter 6. And then there’s a break, and it says “At 6 a. m.,” And Andy Ehat said, “I am almost positive that should be p. m., but it seems like he made a mistake there.” Otherwise, that previous meeting was, uh, very early in the morning.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Casey Paul Griffiths:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    The long meeting. Yeah, very long.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Scott Woodward:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah. So, probably 6 p. m. This is key context. He said, “He heard Elder George Adams preach upon the Book of Mormon, and he proved from the 24th, 28th, and 29th chapters of Isaiah that, ‘the everlasting covenant set by Christ and the apostles had been broken.’” Isaiah uses that phrase, that they’ve “broken mine everlasting covenant.” And then he says that Joseph, after George Adams had taught that, used that phrase, the everlasting covenant has been broken, that seemed to trigger something in Joseph’s mind. Because Joseph Smith then will preach again right after that. He says, “President Joseph Smith bore testimony to the same,” meaning to that same truth, that the everlasting covenant had been broken, “saying that when he was a youth, he began to think about these things but could not find out which of all the sects were right. He went into the grove and inquired of the Lord which of all the sects were right. He received for answer that none of them were right, that they were all wrong, and that the everlasting covenant was broken.” That’s a detail we did not have in any of Joseph’s first ten accounts, and that’s a big deal. What we did have was in the ’42 account that the Lord said that the fullness of the everlasting gospel was soon to be, or would at some future day be made known unto him, right? But he didn’t say anything about everlasting covenant. Later on, in the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord will actually equate those terms. He’ll equate everlasting covenant and the fulness of the gospel. I’ll just throw out a few references, like D&amp;C 66:2, he says, “mine everlasting covenant, even the fulness of my gospel.” D&amp;C 39:11, “the fullness of my gospel, the covenant which I’ve sent forth.” One more, D&amp;C 133:57. He says, “the Lord sent forth the fullness of his gospel, his everlasting covenant.” And so I think that’s important to tie Levi Richards’ account to the 1842 account. The Lord said that the fullness of the gospel would at some future day be made known unto him, and the Levi Richards account’s saying that the everlasting covenant had been broken. Whatever the gospel plan is and whatever the ancients understood it to be and what Joseph would understand it to be, that system was not working in 1820. And the Lord declared as much, according to Levi Richards’ account, saying that that everlasting covenant’s not working. It’s not fully functioning. There’s pieces missing, or there’s some functionality that’s missing.\n",

      "    One more thought on that is D&amp;C section 1, and this is, what, 1831 November? A little more than a year and a half since the church has been organized. He was talking about the idolatry in the world, and he’s talking about people in the world, and he says, “they have strayed from my ordinances,” that would mean, like, my laws, “and have broken mine everlasting covenant.” There’s that phrase again. And then he makes a case for why he called Joseph Smith to be his servant in the last days. One of the reasons is verse 22, “that mine everlasting covenant might be established.” Next verse, “that the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and simple unto the ends of the world.” so this seems to be, like, at the heartbeat of the Restoration is we need to get back into place the fulness of the gospel or the everlasting covenant, the way by which mankind and God can cooperate and collaborate together to help bring about the salvation of mankind, so . . .\n",

Wolf, an Episcopalian clergyman,” and I don’t know if this means he was an Episcopalian clergyman that converted and had immigrated to Nauvoo or if he was just—Joseph Smith would often have people from other faiths come and talk to the Saints.\n",

      "    Right. That makes sense. All right, let’s keep moving along. The next one is same summer. Levi’s account is written down in June. This one’s written down on the 21st of August, 1843. And what’s interesting about this one is it’s given to a reporter, a non-Latter-day Saint, David Nye White. White is an interesting fellow. He’s a reporter for the Pittsburgh Gazette. He’s also the editor, partial owner of the Pittsburgh Gazette, and he’s in Nauvoo looking for stories, basically. We don’t know a lot about the context of why he comes to Nauvoo, but a big scan of his life is that he was an abolitionist. In fact, ten years after this, in 1855, he calls for a new party, and several people gather with him, they nominate a ticket, and this is one of the attributed starting points of the Republican Party, which aren’t big fans of the Saints in the 19th century, but the Saints become big fans of them later on a little bit, so this is Joseph Smith speaking to someone who has no background, probably has not read the Book of Mormon or other similar restoration scriptures or any church tracts, and it’s someone looking at it with a reporter’s eye. So it’s a very succinct account, but it does contain a couple of details that aren’t found in other accounts, too. For instance—and by the way, when you look up the earliest version of this, which you can do on the Joseph Smith Papers site, you’ll see a newspaper article, not a written journal. So we don’t know how Knight may have edited this, too, that we should take it carefully there, but it reads, “I immediately went out into the woods, where my father had a clearing, went to the stump where I had stuck my axe when I had quit work, and kneeled down and prayed, saying, ‘O, Lord, what church shall I join?’ Directly I saw light, and then a glorious personage in the light, and then another personage, and the first personage said to the second, ‘Behold, my Beloved Son. Hear Him.’ I then addressed the second person saying, ‘O, Lord, what church shall I join?’ He replied, ‘Don’t join any of them. They are all corrupt.’ The vision then vanished, and when I came to myself, I was sprawling on my back, and it was some time before my strength returned. So a number of interesting details here, the stump and the axe, which if you’ve seen videos of the First Vision, the latest one, Ask of God, actually shows the stump and the axe that he goes to.\n",

And so you see, when you read the King Follett Sermon, for instance, that Joseph Smith says, “I think the Germans have got a better translation of the Bible than anybody else.” That’s probably Alexander Niebaur helping him out there. Joseph Smith also, later on in his life, liked to play around with Hebrew phraseology in the King Follett sermon. So that’s probably Alexander Niebaur’s doing. And just of interest to us, Niebaur emigrates to Utah, continues to practice dentistry.

That’s awesome. Two things stand out to me here: number one, he’s speaking to a guy who’s a former Jew, and he uses fire again. Joseph only uses fire twice, and in both contexts, it was to people who had Jewish backgrounds.\n",

Wow. And then he says, “Mr. Smith then asked, ‘Must I join the Methodist church?’ ‘No. They are not my people. They have all gone astray. There is none that doeth good, no, not one. But this is my Beloved Son. Hearken ye Him.’” And then he says, “The fire drew nigher, rested upon the tree, enveloped him.” That one actually has some potential issues, doesn’t it, in terms of chronology in comparison with the other accounts? In this case, he’s saying that God the Father is the one that answered him not to join any church, and then he said, “This is my Beloved Son. Hearken ye Him.” And then the fire drew nigh and rested on him and enveloped him. So his chronology is a little off on all of this, and even who’s speaking, if we’re going to judge this account by the composite of the other accounts, we’re going to say he got a few of those details wrong.

The historical background of this one is a little shaky, to be honest with you, but it comes from a young man named Charles Lowe Walker, and it’s actually not his account of the First Vision. So this is technically a thirdhand account of the First Vision, and yet no reason to disbelieve it. Charles Walker is a young man in, I believe, Logan, Utah, who goes to testimony meeting and hears a man named John Alger share his testimony of hearing the First Vision when he was a young man. Now, information we have on John Alger is a little fragmentary, but we do know John Alger was baptized at age 11 in 1832, which means he would have been contemporary with Joseph Smith. That’s what it sounds like.\n",

But Charles Walker goes to the meeting. In fact, let me just read what Charles Walker’s journal says, because there’s some neat stuff in here we might need to process. “2nd of February, Thursday, 1893.” So that’s another thing is it’s a very late account. We’re talking 73 years after the event would have taken place, probably 60 years after John Alger heard Joseph Smith relate this. He said, “I attended fast meeting. Brother John Alger said while speaking of the prophet Joseph that when he, John, was a small boy, he heard the prophet Joseph relate his vision of seeing the Father and the Son, that God touched his eyes with His finger and said, ‘Joseph, this is my Beloved Son. Hear Him.’ As soon as the Lord had touched his eyes with his finger, he immediately saw the Savior.” Charles Walker even adds, “After the meeting, a few of us questioned him about the matter. He told us at the bottom of the meetinghouse steps that he was in the house of Father Smith in Kirtland when Joseph Smith made this declaration and that Joseph, while speaking of it, put his finger to his right eye, suiting the action with the word so as to illustrate and at the same time impress the occurrence on the minds of those unto whom he was speaking.” So that adds in one detail that is not found in any of the accounts.\n",

      "    So somewhere in that gray area, but I do think there’s one interesting precedent to this which corresponds in an interesting way chronologically. If this—he said it happened in Kirtland, and that would have been the time about when Joseph Smith had translated the Book of Abraham. And in Abraham Chapter 3, listen to this verse in light of that: verse 12, Abraham 3:12, “God said to me, Abraham, my son, my son, and his hand was stretched out. Behold, I will show you all these. And he put his hand upon mine eyes, and I saw those things which his hands had made, which were many.” And then he goes on, but, ooh, that’s interesting, right? God “put his hand upon mine eyes,” Abraham said, “and [then] I saw.” That is the pattern Joseph is saying here if this is what Joseph really said according to this account. Let me read it again. “God touched his eyes with his finger and then said, ‘Joseph, this is my Beloved Son. Hear Him.’ And as soon as the Lord had touched his eyes, that’s when he saw the Savior.” So I see a little overlap there. Again, maybe through the translation of the Book of Abraham, this sparked a detail that Joseph thought would be interesting for one audience to hear from his own First Vision which he had not told anybody else, right? If we’re leaning toward the believing side of this, assuming John Alger got the details right, perhaps it’s in that same time period of when Joseph had just translated that verse, which keyed the memory, which then evoked it in his telling of the story. And that’s the best I can do in terms of trying to puzzle this together.\n",

Like, if you’ve never had one, then, you know, you probably don’t want to weigh in as some kind of expert or somehow—you know what I mean?

      "    Well, and one interesting thing as we’ve considered the First Vision is that it’s interesting how it’s kind of shifted in importance. We mentioned in our first podcast that it wasn’t viewed as, like, the seminal event of the Restoration by the early saints. That was the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. That was something tangible, physical you could put into someone’s hands. And yet I think there’s a good reason why the First Vision has increased in importance.\n",

      "    It lays out this great pattern that anybody can follow to get answers to their prayers. It also just kind of plants a flag in the ground and says, hey, we’re not backing off on our truth claims. Look at the language President Hinckley uses. He says, “Two beings of substance were before him. He saw them. They were in form like men, only much more glorious in their appearance. He spoke to them. They spoke to him. They were not amorphous spirits. Each had a distinct personality. They were beings of flesh and bone whose nature was reaffirmed in later revelations which came to the prophet.” And then he makes some pretty black and white statements here. “Our entire case as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints rests on the validity of this glorious First Vision. Nothing on which we base our doctrine, nothing we teach, nothing we live by is of greater importance than this initial declaration. I submit that if Joseph Smith talked with God the Father and his Beloved Son, then all else of which he spoke is true. This is the hinge on which turns the gate that leads to the path of salvation and eternal life.” I mean, President Hinckley wasn’t a man known to make wild statements, right? He was a conservative individual. But in this particular case, and this is a 1998 talk called, “What Are People Asking About Us?” It was in general conference. He just kind of throws the gauntlet down, says, yeah, we’re not going to back off on this. This is how important it is to us. This is where the Restoration begins. And if this is true, we have to take seriously everything that comes after. So let’s wrap this up. Scott, what are your closing thoughts on the First Vision?\n",

      "    Well, I was in the Sacred Grove last week. I almost had the Sacred Grove to myself, I felt like. We had a little tour there, and the Sacred Grove’s pretty big. 10, 15 acres I think is kept up by the church and there’s little trails that meander through the Sacred Grove, and you can just kind of go get lost in there and get lost in your thoughts. And, you know, we’ve been talking about this for several episodes now and thinking about it there. I had a quote from President Hinckley going through my mind. He said, “I recently visited Palmyra, New York.” He said, “Of the events that occurred in that area, one is led to conclude they either happened or they did not. There can be no gray area,” he said. “No middle ground.” And as I was walking through the grove, President Hinckley was in my mind. And I was thinking, Scott Woodward, do you really believe that Joseph Smith was telling the truth? What he said happened here either happened or it did not, and I am just happy to report that I am on the believing side of that equation. I have done everything in my power that I know how to do academically, spiritually, to verify. I’ve considered Joseph’s entire life of sincerity and devotion, the goodness, the depth, the richness of his theology, all the good fruit and beautiful effect that it’s had in my own life, the thousand little evidences that have built up to create my own testimony, and as I think about that, I believe he’s telling the truth. Something significant happened in that grove, because of which the world will never be the same. I know my world will never be the same. So, mark me down as a believer, Casey Griffiths. Mark me down as a believer. Thank you for listening to this episode of Church History Matters.

      "     In 1835 Joseph Smith briefly received into his Kirtland, Ohio home an eccentric visitor who claimed to be a Jewish minister named Joshua. According to Joseph’s journal, it was to this supposedly Jewish man that he recounted what we know as Joseph’s second recorded account of the First Vision. Today we’ll explore how Joseph’s perception that he was speaking with a Jewish man influenced the details he chose to share and the language he used to tell about his experience. Also, three years later, in 1838, Joseph moved to Far West, Missouri, after a season of severe persecution in Kirtland and the apostasy of several church members there. It was while in Far West, with the help of several scribes, that Joseph began recording his official history, which begins with the account of his First Vision that became the official version canonized in Latter day Saint scripture. We’ll explore the unique details of this account and why it makes sense as the official account of Joseph’s vision. And we explore in depth perhaps the most controversial line of this account, where Jesus said of the Christian sects of the day that they were all wrong and that all their creeds were an abomination to Him. What did this mean? And what did this not mean? All of this and more coming your way on today’s episode of Church History Matters, a podcast of Scripture Central. I’m Scott Woodward, a Managing Director at Scripture Central, and my co-host is Casey Griffiths, also a Managing Director at Scripture Central, and today Casey and I dive into our second episode in this series dealing with Joseph Smith’s First Vision. So let’s get into it.\n",

      "    Last time we talked about how the First Vision is foundational to the church. Absolutely can’t get around that, but it’s interesting: We discussed how its significance has grown over time. It was always significant, of course, to Joseph Smith personally, but its institutional significance has grown pretty remarkably. And what I mean by institutional significance is its significance for members of the church, right? And for how we tell the narrative of our church’s history. For Joseph, it may not have been immediately obvious why his own sacred, personal journey would matter to the institutional church, but over time, it seems that that became more and more apparent, and as he started to tell the story more and record the story more, that’s going to naturally help this come into the consciousness and into the historical narrative of the church.\n",

      "   <p>\n",
      "    Casey Paul Griffiths:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    And one thing that we emphasized was that in recent years, it’s become well known that Joseph Smith wrote several different accounts of the First Vision. Essentially, there’s four firsthand accounts: 1832, which is what we discussed last time; 1835, which we’re going to talk about today; 1838, which we may get to today as well, we’re hoping; and 1842. We talked about how the 1832 account was written, at least in part, it seems because of experiences Joseph Smith had in 1832 in and around Greenville, Indiana. The 1835 account is an entry in Joseph Smith’s journal. So those first two aren’t official accounts. They’re not published. 1838 is the official history. That’s the one I think most people are familiar with. It’s the one that’s canonized in the Pearl of Great Price. And then probably the next most well known one is 1842, which is part of the Wentworth Letter, part of which is canonized and placed in the Pearl of Great Price. So…\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Scott Woodward:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah. We also highlighted the fact that they’re—when you look at those four accounts and compare them, there are some significant differences and emphases, right, in each one. And what you make of these differences depends upon your hermeneutic. We used that word, which means, like, your mental lens by which you view and interpret things. If there is no way in your mind that Joseph Smith is a true prophet, like, if you’ve already concluded, like some people have, that he’s an imposter, then you’re going to interpret every difference with, we call it the hermeneutic of suspicion, right? Just trying to catch Joseph in his lies, right? Trying to watch, see if he makes a slip. But if you’re like us—we read through the hermeneutic of trust. And when you read it like that, you interpret these differences as rich and meaningful nuances that naturally arise out of the context in which he related the account. And when each context is understood, then the differences in the accounts make all the sense in the world. So, for instance, you know, last time we highlighted the highly personal, soul-searching context in which the 1832 account was written, which explains perfectly why this account includes so many personal details about Joseph’s inner world at the time of the First Vision. It’s definitely the most personal account, right? By far. It’s got—he talks about his feelings and what’s going on inside: his feeling that he was a convicted sinner and that he wanted forgiveness like crazy, talks about the love that he felt in his heart for many days, and none of those details come up in the other accounts. Most of them not at all, and others are very obscured. So this one, the highly personal nature of the account itself, helps us understand why he included certain details, which he won’t in some of the more public accounts.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Casey Paul Griffiths:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    And so what we’re trying to do with each one of these accounts is just basically explain the context in which it was written, give you what’s unique about each account, and then we’ll also talk about how the context affects the content. So let’s jump in, but before we do 1835, there was one point about 1832 that we just wanted to take a brief moment and address, which is the First Vision takes place in 1820. The earliest account is written in 1832. Twelve years later, most historians will tell you the nearer to an event that an account is written down, the more accurate it tends to be. So, some people would say, “Why wait 12 years to write it?” Scott, how would you answer that question? Why did he wait 12 years before he wrote the First Vision?\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Scott Woodward:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Right. Yeah. Isn’t that historically suspicious, that he wouldn’t write it down until 12 years later? I’d say, well, through the hermeneutic of suspicion, yeah. Yeah. That’s suspicious. The likes of critic Fawn Brodie, we mentioned her a little bit last time, she’ll conclude from that fact that Joseph concocted the vision years after he said it happened just to bolster his claims of prophethood. And so I think that only works if you look at it superficially. If you look at the details in depth and you look at the context, we cannot emphasize context enough here in this podcast. Then a different story emerges. For instance, it’s important to note that prior to 1832, Joseph had never attempted to record his personal history. This is his first attempt, 1832. All record keeping prior to this had centered primarily on preserving his revelations, but as far as his personal history, that’s what I mean. He had never attempted this. So he’s 26 years old in 1832. He’s not a personal journal keeper. It wasn’t until the summer of 1832 that he starts his personal history, and then that fall, in November, he will start his own personal journal. And so it’s important to know that when Joseph did begin writing his history, the First Vision was one of the very first things he records. So if Joseph had kept a journal and had conveniently omitted the First Vision from this record, now, that would be suspicious, yes, from a historical perspective, right? But when you understand that he had never kept a history until 1832, and then one of the very first things that he records in that history is his First Vision account, that’s a different thing altogether.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Casey Paul Griffiths:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    And honestly, if you were to ask 14 year old me, “Did you write anything down?” I mean, no. Just like we mentioned earlier, he sees this, it seems, as a personal manifestation. And I also think there’s a part of Joseph Smith that wanted the work to speak for itself. He wanted the Book of Mormon to be the first thing that people studied to gain a testimony of his message. But you’re absolutely right. The first time he writes down his story, he records the First Vision.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Scott Woodward:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Casey Paul Griffiths:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    That seems to fit with the context that we know.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Scott Woodward:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    It’s probably also important, in 1838, in that account, he’s going to tell us that when he did try to tell this story, he said it “excited a great deal of prejudice, and was the cause of great persecution, which continued to increase. I continued to attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects of the day,” he says, “and in a manner to create in them a spirit of the most bitter persecution and reviling.” So he’d learned early on, he’d gotten burned when he did try to tell that story. He got burned every time. And so I sense in him a reluctance. Whenever I tell that story, it just kicks up the hornet’s nest, right? I get persecution and reviling. So maybe there’s some of that, too, some psychological reason for not leading with the First Vision, right? Like you said, just let’s let the work speak for itself. Examine the Book of Mormon. You don’t have to take my word for it. Just look at the book.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Casey Paul Griffiths:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    You know, if he’s got a book that is 500 pages long, it’s easier for him to defend himself. The First Vision is such a personal experience that he goes into these conflicts with no way to defend himself, basically, so—\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Scott Woodward:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Casey Paul Griffiths:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    It makes sense. You know, you’re traumatized as a young man. The 1838 account, he mentions that he was really, really sort of taken aback when he told a minister that he had seen God, and the minister told him it was all of the devil. And, I mean, at that young age, receiving a strong rebuke from an authority figure, seems like someone that he trusted, you can understand would create a hesitancy for him to want to share this.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Scott Woodward:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah, so I just say in response to why did he wait 12 years, I just say, you know, when you look at the details, right, instead of supporting the conspiracy theory that Joseph’s concocting this idea in 1832 to bolster his prophetic claim, the historical evidence supports the narrative that A, Joseph was not inclined to tell his story because he’d been burned in the past when he did so, and B, that since he’d never kept a journal or personal history prior to 1832, we wouldn’t have expected him to have written it down before then, right? And then it’s important to note that the very first thing he does when he does start a history is tell this story. And so, yeah, I think upon close examination, that’s, that is not an issue, and it’s completely understandable within the context.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Casey Paul Griffiths:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah, I agree. Well, let’s move on to the 1835 account of the First Vision, which probably has the weirdest context of any account of the First Vision. This has some really, really crazy stuff happening when Joseph gives it. We mentioned earlier, this isn’t a public publication. This is written in his journal, and it’s recorded in his journal as part of an encounter that Joseph Smith has with a guy named Joshua the Jewish prophet, AKA Matthias the prophet, AKA Robert Matthews, who’s a colorful figure, deserves a book all of his own, who kind of shows up in Kirtland in 1835 and stays with Joseph Smith for a couple days. Tell us a little bit about Robert Matthews, Scott, and where he’s coming from.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Scott Woodward:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah, there’s some funny kind of quirky details that are recorded in the journal about him. Joseph says he was somewhere between 50 and 55 years old. He had a gray beard. He was slender. He said he wore a green coat and pantaloons and a black fur hat. He frequently shut his eyes with a scowl when he spoke, kind of—I’m trying to picture this guy with his gray beard, black fur hat, wearing a green coat and scowling when he talks, kind of, maybe squinting? Squinting, scowling, I don’t know. Kind of a fun description, but then Joseph learns a little bit more about the suspicions about his past, right? Do you want to talk about the—what he was suspected of?\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Casey Paul Griffiths:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah. There’s a journal entry that just, line by line, is crazy as you read through it, especially when you consider 1830 standards of hospitality, like, if one of these red flags came up today, I think every one of us would kick Joshua out of the house. But it’s like—he keeps staying there. So the journal reads as follows: “Suspicions were entertained that the said Joshua was the noted Matthias of New York, spoken so much of in the public prints on account of the trials he endured in that place before a court of justice for murder, manslaughter, contempt of court, whipping his daughter, et cetera.” And so they start to suspect that he’s this kind of well-known figure who’s been accused of, you know, everything from whipping his daughter up to murder, and then next thing, November 9, after equivocating he confessed he really was Matthias. And at this point, you’re like, kick him out of the house. Don’t let him stay with you. But he’s still there. In fact, he hangs in there for a couple more days. November 10, so this is the day after the guy confesses that he is the noted Matthias accused of murder. “I resumed conversation with Matthias and desired him to enlighten my mind more on his views respecting the resurrection.” And then it cuts, “I told him his doctrine was of the devil and that he was in possession of a wicked and depraved spirit, although he professed to be the spirit of truth itself and said that he also possessed the spirit or soul of Christ.” So this guy doesn’t just have delusions of grandeur, he’s claiming that he is the Holy Ghost, and that he possesses the spirit of Jesus Christ.\n",

      "    You look it up, and I’ll keep going, because it actually says after this conversation, when Joseph Smith tells him he’s possessed of a wicked and depraved spirit, Matthias still doesn’t leave. It’s not until the day after. “He tarried until Wednesday the 11th,” the journal reads, “after breakfast,” So they feed him breakfast first, “when I told him that my God told me his god was the devil, and I could not keep him any longer, and he must depart, and so I for once cast out the devil in bodily shape and, I believe, a murderer.”\n",

      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah, so I’ve got it here. I’m on Joseph Smith Papers looking at this account, and he said, yeah, he doesn’t know who he is yet when he tells the story. All he knows is that this guy is a Jewish guy. And I think that’s actually important for how Joseph tells the story—which I’ll make the case here in a minute, but he says this: So after he says that he was dressed with a sea-green frock coat and pantaloons of the same color and a black fur hat with a narrow brim and he shut his eyes frequently with a scowl on his countenance when he spoke. He then just says this: he says, “I made some inquiry after his name but received no definite answer.” And then he said, next line, “We soon commenced talking upon the subject of religion, and after I had made some remarks concerning the Bible, I commenced giving him a relation of the circumstances connected with the coming forth of the Book of Mormon as follows.” And then he starts telling the First Vision story. So he tells his First Vision story on the way to telling about the coming forth of the Book of Mormon.\n",

      "    It’s fairly brief. It’s a couple paragraphs in Joseph Smith’s journal, but there’s a lot in this one that’s unique or original. In fact, I’d say after the 1832 account, this is probably the one that has the most unique features. It might be the one that has the most unique features among the Joseph Smith accounts that are given. For instance, one thing that is unique in this is this is the first reference to James 1:5, that he’s reading through the Bible. He says, “Being perplexed in mind, I retired to the silent grove and bowed down before the Lord under a realizing sense that he had said, if the Bible be true, ask and ye shall receive, knock and it shall be opened, seek and ye shall find. And again, if any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not.” So he makes a direct appeal to the scriptures. This part of James 1:5 and the idea of asking God coming from the scriptures is going to become a central tenet of the rest of the accounts. Maybe the most important part of the accounts, because he’s trying to, I think, explain later on how other people can do what he did—that anybody can ask God. That’s a unique feature. What else is unique about this as we go through?\n",

      "    1832 account, he doesn’t even mention Satan, but here, boy, let me read this. He said, “Information was what I most desired at this time, and with a fixed determination to obtain it, I called upon the Lord for the first time in the place above stated, or in other words, I made a fruitless attempt to pray,” he says. “My tongue seemed to be swollen in my mouth so that I could not utter. I heard a noise behind me, like some person walking toward me. I strove again to pray, but could not. The noise of walking seemed to draw nearer. I sprung up on my feet and looked around, but I saw no person or thing that was calculated to produce the noise of walking.” Yeah, this is the only account that mentions this, right? This noise of walking, this kind of sense that someone’s there. And then when I tried to pray, my tongue was swollen in my mouth. That’s interesting, right? So it’s almost as if the dark power is, like, trying to intimidate or scare him out of praying in this sense, and then trying to bind his tongue. He will mention the bound tongue in the 1838 account.\n",

And in a rainstorm, and just with my cell phone flashlight, I went to the Sacred Grove in Palmyra, just thinking, I want to be in the Sacred Grove.

All of his other accounts call it a pillar of light, but “a pillar of fire appeared above my head, and it presently rested down upon me and filled me with joy unspeakable.” And then he says, “a personage,” one, “a personage appeared in the midst of this pillar of flame, which was spread all around and yet nothing consumed,” as if the fire, he thought, might consume the leaves. And then he says, “Another personage soon appeared, like unto the first. And he said unto me, ‘Thy sins are forgiven thee.’ He testified unto me that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and I saw many angels in this vision. I was about 14 years old when I received this first communication.” And that’s the end of the account. So we’ve got pillar of fire, pillar of flame, Father and the Son appear not together, but one and then the other. That’s an interesting insight. And then “thy sins are forgiven thee.”\n",

Now watch how this, like, plays out, I think this is pretty powerful. So first of all, the guy’s a stranger, so this is going to account for the objective details, right? Very little personal feelings here. Way different than the 1832 account in that regard. He is also speaking here in religious generalities, which both Jews and Christians could relate with. Like he’s saying things like, “matters that involved eternal consequence,” right? He didn’t even bring up that he was trying to understand which church he should join. It’s “matters of eternal consequence.” And then he only briefly touches on the revivals, which would have been of little interest to a Jew, right? Christian revivals. And then I think telling about Satan in talking to a Jewish man is something that Jews understand. They’re called ordeals, right? Where a prophet, before his call, wrestles with the powers of darkness somehow. Feelings of fear, feelings of inadequacy. Isaiah comes to mind, like Isaiah 6. And then mentions of a pillar of fire instead of a pillar of light. Boy, if that’s not a direct reference to the shechinah, right, that the Jews would have recognized.

Again, Isaiah 6 is a good example of that. When Isaiah is called, there’s other angels there. He looks, he sees God. There’s also some seraphim or something that brings a coal and touches his mouth, and there’s kind of this ordeal of purification. He’s afraid, and there’s more beings than one there. Jews would have recognized this reference to a divine council. That’s a fairly strong Jewish concept. And yet he doesn’t hold back from testifying boldly of two divine beings, and that one was Jesus the Christ, who forgives sin.

An organic story like this is going to be a little bit different based on where Joseph Smith is at, and I hadn’t thought about that before, that there’s a lot of Old Testament imagery—a pillar of flame—that might be better suited for a Jewish person than the usual Christian imagery that He invokes in his other First Vision accounts.\n",

In the midst of the gods,” these spiritual, divine beings, “he holds judgment.” Then another one, 1 Kings 22:19, it’s the prophet Micaiah. He says, “Hear thou, therefore, the word of the Lord, Jehovah. I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.” So there’s two examples of the divine council. And so I think that’s pretty significant in terms of the only account that mentions a bunch of angels. How did he say it? He said, “many angels I saw in this vision,” right? He doesn’t say where they were. Were they surrounding God? That’s how I picture it. Surrounding the Father and the Son on both sides, like Micaiah said. But he doesn’t mention—like you said, it’s kind of frustrating. We wish we had more details about that, but I think his Jewish audience would be nodding his head as Joseph told that story.\n",

This work is a collaboration. There’s a lot of fingerprints on it from different people, but this early part, which—the very first, we don’t have the original manuscript. It was copied into the history of the church, but we think that Joseph Smith starts writing it at Far West, Missouri, his scribes are George Robinson and Sidney Rigdon, and becomes the start of what becomes the six-volume History of the Church. It takes almost 20 years for the history of the church to be published.\n",

Like, he sits down, you can imagine, with his scribes and works out all the facts, makes sure that his dates and his locations are precise. There’s not that same kind of precision in the earlier two accounts. And to be honest with you, I mean, this should be the canon account.

      "    This is from Arthur Henry King. He’s this British professor of English literature that converts to the church, and I love this quote. I share it with my classes just to show why the 1838 account is special. This is a professor of English at a British university, and he says that what converted him to the church wasn’t necessarily the Book of Mormon, it was the simplicity of the language in the 1838 account. Here’s what he wrote: “When I was first brought to read Joseph Smith’s story, I was deeply impressed. I wasn’t inclined to be impressed as a stylistician. I spent my life being disinclined to be impressed. So when I read his story, I thought to myself, ‘This is an extraordinary thing. This is an astonishingly matter-of-fact and cool account. This man is not trying to persuade me of anything. He doesn’t feel the need to. He’s stating what happened to him, and he’s stating it not enthusiastically, but in quite a matter-of-fact way. He’s not trying to make me cry or feel ecstatic.’ That struck me, and that began to build my testimony, for I could see that this man was telling the truth.” And so this British professor is basically saying the strength of this account is its simplicity. I mean, even comparing it to the 1832 account, which has a lot of kind of, I guess, grand language. This is a by the books, here’s exactly what happened to me. I went here, I did this thing, and this happened. And as a historian, you know, that’s one of those things where you’d say are they clear and neutral in their tone?\n",

I think he’s trying to persuade you with the facts. Like, if I could just tell my story, I think the truth will cut its own way, right? In that way it’s persuasive. It’s persuasive in the simplistic, straightforward telling of the facts. I like that. He’s not trying to get you to cry when you tell this story. Sometimes I feel like as missionaries, we want people to feel it when we tell this story, right? If not cry, at least feel something deep in your heart, but Joseph’s approach was, I’m just going to tell you the facts as they transpired, and I’ll let you come to your own conclusion.

There’s real power in the story, and I think this is the best written version of the story. So let’s talk about what makes it unique.

Like, help us understand. Help paint the picture here. And so he’s going back and grasping for all those details, which is super helpful in kind of recreating this in our minds. Oh, and by the way, he spends 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, almost, verses on the Christian revivals, right? What he barely even mentioned in 1835 account. But if his audience here is primarily Christian, it’s interesting that he’d spend so much time on the Christian revivals here. Just lo here, lo there, the feeling between the Presbyterians, the Methodists, how his family is kind of dividing along Presbyterian and is it Methodist lines? Yeah. You know, what is to be done? Who of all these parties are right? The real question that he’s highlighting here is which church should I join, right? I get Christianity’s divided, they’re not all united, they all have different claims, and I’ve been confused, and maybe Joseph’s hoping that his Christian readers are nodding their heads in recognition that, yeah, like, we know what you’re talking about, brother.\n",

And that’s not wholly unique among Christian religions, but Joseph Smith is stating a how-to: I read this in the Bible. You’ve probably got a Bible. Why don’t you go read this passage? I went out in the woods to pray. You probably have a private place you can pray. I had this experience. You could have this experience, too. Takes me back to Joseph Smith saying, God hath not revealed anything to Joseph, but that he would reveal to the Twelve and the least Saint as soon as they’re able to bear it. Like, at this point he’s trying to not emphasize that he’s special because God spoke to him, but emphasizing process. Here’s how you can have the same experience that I had, too.

And another thing that’s unique to this is this probably has the most extensive description of the demonic force, of the force that tries to stop him before he sees the pillar of light. And, I mean, I can understand some of the earlier accounts, him not wanting to mention this. I did a paper a couple years ago on films about the First Vision, and all the filmmakers said, that was one thing that we ran into, is if we’re making a movie for missionary purposes, do we put in the part where he’s overcome by darkness before the light appears? I think a reason why this might not have been emphasized as much in ’32 and ’35 is it raises a whole other can of worms, right?

The powers of darkness didn’t want what was about to happen to happen. I was seized upon. “I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction, not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being.” Like, this—what happened next, the powers of darkness, Satan, the being from the unseen world.

Two personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description. One spoke, Pointed to the other, said this is my beloved Son. There’s none of the vagueness found in the earlier accounts here.

Well, isn’t it interesting that what he’s omitting here is anything about his own personal seeking for forgiveness, and what he doesn’t mention here, which he already has in the first two accounts, is that the first thing that was told him was, your sins are forgiven thee. He doesn’t make any mention of that here. I don’t know why. I think it would have fit fine here, because I think Christians all believe in the forgiveness of sin. Many Christians and members of the church who had recently left, apostates, believe Joseph was a sinner. So maybe that would have been a good thing to include, but I don’t know. I’m not critiquing Joseph’s account. I just wonder, that seems like it would have fit here, but for some reason, he omits it.\n",

And he also emphasizes, “My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join.” In the ’32 account, he is seeking personal forgiveness of his sins, which—these motives overlap with each other, right? Yeah. “What church should I join” is directly connected to the forgiveness of sin, right? That makes sense because it’s through the grace of God mediated by the true church that I will have access to the forgiveness of sin, I think, would be the thinking of the time, right? So those do go together. He turns the volume way up on which church I should join here, and turns down almost to silent here that he was seeking for forgiveness of sin, whereas in the 1832, it’s exactly reversed, right? Turns the volume way up on, I’m seeking personal forgiveness and very little, just a brief mention, of the confusion about the churches, so. Just, again, emphasis based on the context, based on audience, based on the hoped-for outcome. In this sense, a public profession of what occurred here with an outcome hoping to diminish persecution and, like you’re saying, hopefully give people a pattern or a template how they can also know how to evaluate this church, this church that there’s so many weird rumors about. If you want to evaluate this church, I can relate. I can relate to that. I’ve been in that position where I’ve tried to be evaluating churches the best I could, and it’s so confusing, and a lot of churches are saying a lot of things about other churches, and does that sound familiar? A lot of people are saying things about this church right now, my church, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and so this is how I went about my journey, and so can you.\n",

For at this time it never had entered into my heart that all were wrong. And which I should join? I was answered that I must join none of them. They were all wrong. The personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight, that those professors were all corrupt, that they draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, for they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.” Now, he just gets right to the point there, doesn’t he?\n",

      "    Scott Woodward:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah. Yeah. I think this is so important to get right, because this verse—this is verse 19 in the Pearl of Great Price version here, is so easily read as a condemnation of other Christians, right? Because he says “they were all wrong, and that all their creeds were an abomination in His sight,” and “those professors were all corrupt,” that “they [drew] near to me with their lips [and] their hearts were far from me.” In some ways it’s like, well, how could you not take that as a condemnation of other Christians? And for sure, yeah, the hypocritical ones. Yeah, those who are drawing near to him with their lips, but their heart’s far from him, yeah. He’s condemning hypocrisy here for sure, but I think this is more fundamental than sometimes we make it. Sometimes we make this, like, a doctrinal issue. Like, well, a lot of people didn’t have a correct understanding of the Godhead, and that just bothers the Savior to no end. And so he condemns their creeds that just don’t get it right, you know, and boy, I just wholeheartedly disagree with that based on Joseph Smith’s subsequent statements. A lot of them that he makes in Nauvoo, he actually says that their creeds have some truth in them. They also have some error, but that’s not the issue. For Joseph Smith, he was fundamentally anti-credal. It’s the creeds themselves. I think that’s what the Savior’s saying here, that their creeds are an abomination. So, what Joseph said about the creeds is this. He said, “I want to come up into the presence of God and learn all things. But the creeds,” speaking about the Christian creeds, “the creeds set up stakes and say, ‘Hitherto shalt thou come and no further,’ which I cannot subscribe to,” Joseph said. He also said, “The Latter-day Saints have no creed but are ready to believe all true principles that exist as they are made manifest from time to time.” So it’s not that what was in the creeds are so abominable, it’s that creeds make us believe too little. They make us believe too little. And God is bigger than creeds. The First Vision was not the Lord saying He hates Catholics, or He hates Methodists, or He hates Baptists or Presbyterians. Not at all, right? If we’re reading this carefully, we’re finding that what He hates is hypocrisy and limiting creeds that limit and confine people’s belief, sometimes to erroneous things, but sometimes not. I think that’s what Joseph was pushing back on in his Article of Faith 13 when he said, “We believe all things.” He’s actually trying to push back against this idea of you can summarize all your beliefs in one succinct document, and that’s it. So Joseph’s anti-credal. I think that’s the more fundamental issue here that he learned first in the Sacred Grove.\n",

He said, “The first and fundamental principle of our holy religion is that we believe that we have the right to embrace all and every item of truth,” now catch this language, “without limitation or without being circumscribed or prohibited by the creeds or the superstitious notions of men.” Yeah. Creeds make you believe too little. We don’t want to be hindered, limited, circumscribed in believing all things that are true. That’s the issue here, not that, well, you know, sometimes it’s pretty confusing about the Godhead, the way that they kind of articulate it.

There’s no limitation in the Bible itself. It’s an open book that’s still being written.\n",

And that seems to be the third issue we haven’t highlighted here is that Jesus says “they have a form of godliness,” other Christians of Joseph’s day, “but they deny the power thereof.” It’s not enough to have the form or go through the motions. This is—a fundamental principle of the Restoration is going to be how can we get the power of godliness back into the lives of men and women in the sense in which it was in the New Testament times? And that’s going to—we’re going to find out as the story unfolds. It’s going to have to do with ordinances, right? The ordinances are going to be the gateways to the power of godliness. It’s going to have to do with the priesthoods that mediate those ordinances. And so there’s a whole lot that’s coming down the pike here, but all Joseph knows initially is hypocrisy: I don’t like it; creeds: too limiting; and power of godliness is essential for the full Christian experience to receive all that God actually has to give, so yeah. This is not a condemnation of Christianity, but it is, I think, a commentary that there is more that needs to be opened up to at that time and ever after, and Joseph will say that to all of his Christian brothers and sisters. He’ll say, please, keep all the good that you have, and then come and see if we can’t add to that. I love that invitation. And what is it that we have to add? It centers in the ordinances, right? It’s about that power of godliness, peace, and so.\n",

I then said to my mother, I have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true.” As gentle a statement as he can make to his mom, who’s just become a Presbyterian.

To decrease persecution, but also, as you’re pointing out, give them a guide on how they, too, can personally get some sort of confirmation of the truthfulness, right? So this was the most factual by far, with details, early spring 1820, beautiful spring day, morning, direct quotations, things he talked about to his mom, things that people were saying back and forth to each other, what the Bible said, emphasis on the Christian revivals, I prayed because the Bible told me to. He also mentions, and we haven’t said this, he also mentions feeling like Paul, who was a revered Christian hero, who also saw a vision, right? And Joseph will ask, well, who am I that I can withstand God? Why does the world think to make me deny what I’ve actually seen? So he’s casting himself very much in that biblical role of prophets. This is not a fringy, weird thing that’s occurring amongst us. It’s actually the same thing that has occurred many times in biblical ages, right?\n",

Next week we continue this series on Joseph Smith’s First Vision by exploring his 1842 account, written in response to a newspaper editor’s request to Joseph for him to provide a brief sketch of the rise of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We’ll also look at Orson Pratt’s own telling of Joseph’s experience, which he published in 1840, and the interesting influence it had on Joseph’s own 1842 account. Today’s episode was produced by Zander Sturgill and Scott Woodward, edited by Nick Galieti and Scott Woodward, with show notes and transcript by Gabe Davis.

For example, if Joseph Smith saw God the Father and Jesus Christ in a vision, does that mean he didn’t actually see them in reality? And what are we to make of the fact that other people around the time of Joseph Smith’s vision also claimed to have had visions of God, many of whom were Methodists? And how might the form of these Methodist conversion narratives at the time have impacted how Joseph Smith recorded his vision? Furthermore, what is the interplay between Joseph Smith’s memory of his First Vision and the various contexts in which he recalled it and recorded it? Today on\n",

In fact, I want to talk about one of Steve’s publications. He just had a book come out from Oxford a couple years ago called The First Vision Memory and Mormon Origins, which kind of traces the history of the First Vision the way it’s been used in the church. Fascinating book, a great read, and I’m glad to have Steve here because he’s a good colleague.

      "    So, okay, so Steve, let me start with a question. It’s kind of also a autobiographical question. So I’ve noticed in listening to you over the years that one of your favorite words to use to describe yourself is a seeker. And I love that. Tell us a little bit about where and when your seeking began, and then specifically where and when your intensive interest in and then research on Joseph Smith’s First Vision began.\n",

      "   <p>\n",
      "    Steven C. Harper:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Oh, great question. I did not realize it as a teenager, but I had a seeker’s spirit. I didn’t yet have tools and skills for seeking, but my dad and mother helped me to be a seeker, helped me to want to know the truth and be willing to quest for it, work hard for it, seek after it. So it’s sort of a heritage. It’s a blessing belonging to the family that I *inaudible* to, but I was on my mission when I really gained a desire to study the scriptures intensively. I wanted to spend the rest of my life doing that, and then as I got interested in teaching the scriptures and the history of the Church as a career, became aware of a really important talk that you both know by President J. Reuben Clark, who gave it in the late 1930s to Church religious educators, and one of the things he emphasized in that talk is that there are two things that if you’re going to be a church, a religious educator, you’ve got to really know and believe as literal reality, and one of those is the atonement of Jesus Christ, and the other one is the First Vision of Joseph Smith. And so I don’t love one of those more than the other, right? For me there are two things that are inseparably connected, but my training and background is better suited to studying the revelations of Joseph Smith in the early American context. So I thought there’s nothing better I could research and write about than those revelations, and preeminent among them is Joseph Smith’s First Vision. It really kicked off for me, though, the going beyond my own intense research of the First Vision accounts, and the visionary accounts of other people in this time and place, that didn’t start for me until about 2008 when I was part of a summer seminar with Richard Bushman. It was called “Joseph Smith and His Critics,” and the goal was to study the criticisms of Joseph Smith and his revelations and to respond to them in different ways than we had. We kind of realized that, you know, we’ve responded quite a bit, and maybe we need to think of some new responses and address these important questions with fresh eyes, and my assignment in that seminar was First Vision, and that led to just an intense and long-standing, continuing academic interest to go along with my spiritual interest in it.\n",

You want to throw a question out at Steve here? And we’ll just, we’ll just go through some of these. See how much we can get through.\n",

      "   <p>\n",
      "    Casey Paul Griffiths:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah, absolutely. We’re just going to run down the list, and the first one is actually a question I’ve been asked by students in my classes, which is was the First Vision a vision or a physical visitation, and did Joseph Smith really see God the Father and Jesus Christ if it was a vision? So Steve, was it a vision or was it a visitation? Were they physically there? Was he seeing something? What’s your take on that from the sources?\n",

      "   <p>\n",
      "    Steven C. Harper:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    This is a terrific question, and I can answer it in one sense, but not in some kind of final, ultimate sense, because I frankly don’t know the physics or the metaphysics of it. If I had been with Joseph in the grove, I’m not sure I would have seen what he saw, but that is not me saying that he didn’t actually see them in person. So he was emphatic that he did see them in person: “I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light, I saw two personages, and they did, in reality, speak to me.” He’s emphatic that he saw God and Christ, and so I think you’re noticing that I’m avoiding the words it was either a vision or a visitation. Those are words that we put on it today. We want to know, right? That’s sort of a characteristic of our time and place. How real was it? The answer to that was, it was real. It was real. One way we can see this is that in the late 1890s there was a fireside, what we would today call a fireside, in St. George, and an old timer spoke, and he told about when he was a little boy, way back in the earliest days of the church, and he heard Joseph Smith tell the story of his First Vision, and he said that Joseph said that the Father touched him on the eye, and that Joseph held up his hand and touched himself on the eye to demonstrate, and he said that when the Father touched his eye, Jesus appeared, and he could see the Savior. So that’s a singular account. It’s a thirdhand one. We don’t have a way to triangulate it. I’m not trying to contend that that detail is an absolute fact. What I’m trying to say about this is that there’s evidence in the historical record, besides Joseph’s emphatic testimony, that other Latter-day Saints thought of it as a physical visit from God and Christ, and I have no reason to think otherwise than that.\n",

      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Love it. Now, you mentioned that you’ve not only studied Joseph Smith’s vision, but also contemporaries of Joseph Smith, and that leads to another question. Actually, there’s multiple ways that different listeners have asked the question, so I’ll read a few varieties of this, and then you can respond to this. Some of our listeners have said this: “I heard that other people had similar visions in the 1800s in upstate New York about God and Jesus Christ. Is there anything true about that?” Another listener said, “I’ve heard that stories about people having visions weren’t really that uncommon during Joseph Smith’s day. What makes his account different from others?” Another listener actually, like, loaded up a bunch of specific names, like, “I’ve heard that Norris Stearns had a vision in Greenfield, Massachusetts in 1815 which is very similar to Joseph’s.” Elias Smith in 1816, Charles Finney in 1821, and the list goes on.\n",

      "    These are very cool questions. I’m excited that people are asking these questions. These are the kinds of questions I ask in my research and writing, and I learned to do so from Professor Richard Bushman. He published a really, really, really important article, prize-winning article, about this in the late 1990s, “The Visionary World of Joseph Smith.” It’s in\n",

      "    </em>\n",
      "    . If you Googled “Bushman” and “visionary world,” it would turn it up. And so Richard Bushman, a Latter-day Saint scholar and historian and a highly acclaimed scholar, is the one who turned us on to the facts of the matter. And the facts of the matter are there are people not just in upstate New York, but throughout the North American continent, at least the eastern parts, that are settled by descendants of Europeans—so, there are people there in the late 1700s, early 1800s, who testify that they’ve had some variation on a vision. Some say they saw angels or spirits. One fellow used the word a genie. It was like a genie. Others say the Father, the Son. Some say the Father and the Son. And these are similar to Joseph’s in some ways, and then they’re quite different in some ways. I—what do I make of them? I do not doubt them or dispute them. I try to help people understand that there’s no reason why we shouldn’t expect that to have been happening. If you lack wisdom, ask God. If you knock, it’ll be opened.\n",

      "    There’s no reason to assume that only Joseph Smith is asking these questions or longing to know his relationship with and standing to God, and there’s no reason to assume that God wouldn’t answer others. Now, I don’t know. I can’t validate or verify whether these are actual experiences or not, but I don’t doubt that they could be. And what I do notice, though, is that the idea of writing off Joseph’s—the reality of his experience because there are other similar ones, it’s bad logic. It’s bad reasoning. It’s a non sequitur, it does not follow. So if your first premise is there were lots of people—and there weren’t lots. It was not terribly uncommon, but it also wasn’t common, it’s not 9 out of 10 people who are seeing the Father and the Son in the woods. It’s one out of a who knows how many, but it’s a small number, but probably enough that most people have heard of somebody, somewhere, in their recent past or lifetime that had an experience in their bedroom or in their law office or in the woods with a vision of some kind or other. So Joseph Smith’s gets more concrete and more—he gets more emphatic over time as he describes it about the theological content of what happened. In other words, Joseph’s vision leads, by his 1838-39 narration of it, to the establishment of the Church of Jesus Christ, and he—the more he’s opposed by it and the more it goes counter to his culture, the more adamantly Joseph Smith affirms it.\n",

      "    That is exactly the opposite of Charles Finney. Charles Finney is the most famous other person who experienced a vision of the Savior in the woods of Western New York or actually in his lofts. He prayed in the woods of western New York in Adams County, about the same time Joseph Smith did, and then later, in his law office, envisioned the Savior. Over the years, as Finney became a leading figure in Presbyterian revivalism, a lot of listeners will know the burned over district. That—we sometimes use that a bit anachronistically. Western New York didn’t become known as the burned over district until after Joseph Smith had moved away from it, and it became the burned over district largely because of the preaching, the revival preaching of Charles Finney. He becomes a deeply committed convert to Presbyterianism as a result of his vision. As the years go by and Joseph Smith is getting more and more emphatic about his vision and the Father and the Son telling him that their church was not on the earth and so forth, Finney actually backs away from his vision. And by the his mature years, it’s sort of a spiritual experience, it’s more fuzzy around the edges, and he doesn’t use it nearly so much to establish the theological content of his teaching as we see Joseph Smith doing. The farther we go in time, the more Joseph Smith relies on his vision in some ways, which is different from the others.\n",

      "    Yeah. So contrast that, right? Whereas Finney says, well, yeah, it kind of was just a vision sort of thing, maybe metaphysical, not physical, you have Joseph Smith saying, “I saw two personages, and they did in reality speak to me,” right? He gets more emphatic about it, and that’s against—both of them are talking against the tide of unpopularity, right? It’s not mainstream to say you had that kind of experience. It’s not unheard of, but it’s not mainstream. And so as Finney moves and becomes the epitome of that mainstream, Joseph Smith is further and further from it. So that leads us to your question about how much Joseph Smith’s experience is like Methodist conversion narratives or evangelical Christian conversion narratives: It is quite like them in some ways and then very different from them in other ways. You might think of Methodism as the language. If you’re going to have a vision in the woods or wherever else, what language are you going to use to speak it? I know it’s English, but you might think of the vocabulary and the script for this sort of thing as a Methodist dialect. What else does Joseph Smith have, right?\n",

He’s heard it lots of times before, and he compares his experience to it and uses it as best he can to narrate it. I don’t think he feels terribly satisfied with that, right? He—in the beginning of his 1832 autobiography and his later one he starts by telling us he’s very poorly educated and he can’t do a very good job of describing what defied all description. But Christopher Jones is the scholar who has shown us how closely Joseph’s accounts follow some tropes and some themes of Methodist conversion. But there’s some interesting dynamics there to be sure, and that is that in Joseph’s earliest autobiography, his 1832 account, he follows that script pretty closely, and in some ways it therefore doesn’t sound very distinctively Latter-day Saint. It’s the most generic, we might say. Well, by 1838-39, he is peeved at the Evangelical clergy. You can tell by the way he starts his account. And then, by the way, he calls them priests.

      "    Exactly. So in this version of the story, Joseph uses the Methodist form, but he turns it on its head. He uses it to indict the Methodists. The Methodists had used it to indict others. So, for example, the founder of Methodism, or at least the pioneer, John Wesley, had told his followers a generation before Joseph Smith, or two, he had said, guys, we will become very numerous because we have what everybody’s looking for, but the danger of that is that we will become like them. We will get to the point where we have a form of godliness, but we deny the power thereof.\n",

So another way of saying that is that Methodism, as one analyst put it, Orthodoxy, Orthodox Evangelical Christianity, became Methodized, meaning the Methodists sort of took it over because they treated personal spiritual experiences like Joseph’s seriously. That wasn’t a crazy thing. It was something God would really do, just like the New Testament said, He would put His Spirit into the people and they would have the gifts. Well so Methodists take that seriously. Joseph Smith wants, he tells us—in one account of his vision, he tells us that he attended the Methodist meetings, and he wanted to feel what they felt and shout like they shouted, but he couldn’t. He didn’t get it. So then the vision occurs, and he thinks, I did, it worked, it finally worked, and he’s eager to report that to the Methodist minister, and then the minister treats him with contempt instead of validation. And this is a very difficult disconnect for Joseph. He has to, therefore, figure out what the vision meant. Now, people might object. They might say, well, huh-uh, because he understands from the beginning everything about it and how it’s going to lead to him being the president of the church. That’s not true.\n",

      "    Great questions. Let’s set forth the facts, the historical facts. So these are things that are the same no matter what perspective you choose, what interpretation you choose. Interpretations vary, but the facts that don’t vary are that the historical records say only two things about who he told and when he told, and one of them is what we’ve been reading. The most specific one is verse 21 of Joseph Smith’s history in the Pearl of Great Price, which is a selection from his manuscript history. “Some few days after I had this vision, I happened to be in company with one of the Methodist preachers who was active in the aforementioned religious excitement. I took the occasion to give him an account of the vision,” and he was—he reacted with contempt. Joseph Smith was surprised, as Scott said. This is not an expected answer. It caught him by surprise. It was psychologically painful. It was, I think—and now I’m interpreting, right? So the fact of the matter is he says he reported the vision, and it was—he was surprised, and he was rejected. So what might that fact mean? I have made a lot of that fact following on the pioneering work of James B. Allen. He thought we ought to make a lot of that fact and that there was probably a key in it. And I think there was, too, the key meaning that Joseph Smith probably decides to clam up about the vision after that rejection. It’s not fun to be rejected. None of us like being rejected, and if we go and tell our, our happiest thing that’s ever happened to us, the greatest thing we’ve ever seen, and an authority figure who we trusted and who we thought would validate us rejects us just as soundly as possible, then the likeliest thing to do is to clam up.\n",

Well, those are things that we might think of of our time and place, but that’s not universal reality. There’s no reason to believe that those assumptions are correct, and it’s terrible history. You can’t do history that way. In history, you have to go with what the historical facts say and the evidence. The other fact is that in his 1832 autobiography, the earliest one, Joseph simply says, “I could find no one who would believe the heavenly vision. Nevertheless, I pondered these things in my heart,” echoing there the gospel of Luke about Mary. And doing that, by doing that, telling us that he had some sacred stuff that he wasn’t going to throw out there because it wasn’t appreciated.\n",

And Joseph being called to the work in his narrative starts with that. And that’s how Mother Smith tells the story as well. So early saints didn’t necessarily even know there was a First Vision. We might think that’s impossible, or if there was a First Vision, he certainly would have told them, if there was a First Vision, they would have all known about it.

It’s awkward when I write, but when I speak, I feel like I can speak freely. I can have the Spirit of God, but writing is awkward, and I’m not good at it, and people are going to mock at these things, Lord.\n",

      "    Steven C. Harper:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah. Understanding that is a real key to understanding why Joseph Smith was reluctant to record the vision and then why he recorded it the ways that he did when he did. So let’s map that out a little bit. He had a terrible dilemma. There are two dilemmas at the heart of the First Vision. The one we’re talking about here is the dilemma that has to do with recording it. So by 1830, by the time the church is founded, he has two manuscripts of the Book of Mormon, an original and a printer’s. He’s got a couple of dozen written revelation manuscripts, and those just continue to multiply. He’s not at all reluctant to write the revelations the Lord gives him. He’s confident in those. But notice that he does not yet have a written record of his first revelation, and he’s very reluctant to write it. The Lord tells him the day the church is organized to let there be a record kept and document your apostolic work, right? And Joseph delays that. He doesn’t do it. He doesn’t start a journal, etc. until two and a half years later when the Lord tells him again, emphatically now, in section 85 of the Doctrine and Covenants, you’ve got to get this written down. If you don’t, there’s no record of your earliest revelation. So Joseph, that same day that revelation comes, gets a journal. He starts a journal. About that same time he starts his earliest autobiography and tells the earliest account of his vision, but the first thing he does out of the gate after he says, I’m going to document the marvelous experiences that the Lord has given me, then he says, I’m not a very good writer. I didn’t get to go to school. So he’s got this conflict. I’ve got to record it, and I’m inadequate to record it.\n",

      "   <p>\n",
      "    Casey Paul Griffiths:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    And I want to add to that, basically, by just saying it seems like it increases in theological significance to him, too. The earliest accounts of the First Vision are, my sins were forgiven me. That’s the main outcome. By the 1838 it seems like he’s tapped into this idea of, this is a big deal for everybody, not just for me, and so he’s talking about the theological consequences for all people, including, you know, the big bombshell that there’s no church on the earth today that belongs to Jesus Christ, which is still the probably the most controversial claim you can tie back to Joseph Smith.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Steven C. Harper:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah, I think you’re right about that, Casey, that the 1832 account, the focus of it is Joseph’s individual salvation. It’s his personal sinfulness that is the driver of his quest. And that means that he needs a church. He needs The Church of Jesus Christ, and his observations tell him that none of the ones he’s observing is matching the New Testament version. This becomes grief to his soul, and he finally discovers that he can go to God directly in the woods and receive the forgiveness that he so desperately needed. It’s not that the question about a church isn’t there, but it’s background. It’s not the foreground questions: can I be forgiven, and how? By 1838-39, right, it’s a competition of churches, and Joseph is in battle. So our present circumstances make a huge difference in the way we remember things. And some people might not think so. They might think that they’re perfect at remembering things the same way every time. They just haven’t observed their own memories enough, if that’s the case. All of us reshape our memories in real time based on what actually happened in our past and our present circumstances. All of us have experienced memory distortion. Memories are not accurate or inaccurate. They’re both accurate and inaccurate. Joseph Smith, in 1838-39, when he writes the account, or has someone else write it for him in the manuscript history, he has just come off the worst year of his life, and he has been incarcerated. He’s been—he’s watched his people be brutally treated. He’s been driven from two different states. And he is upset. Really upset. And you can hear that as it begins. “Owing to the many reports put in circulation by evil disposed and designing people.” And in this account, he uses the word persecute or persecution over and over. And he often has an adjective, “hot persecution,” “the bitterest persecution.” So his present circumstance is giving this one a very defensive tone and an embattled tone, right? And when he searches his memory for the beginning of his persecuted life, he remembers, yeah, it started a few days after the vision when I came in company with that minister, who I thought should be my friend and my ally, who I really needed, and ever since then, people who should have befriended me have been my enemies and have persecuted me. It’s important to understand his present so we can see how it’s shaping his memory of his past.\n",

      "    Can I ask a follow-up on this, too, Steve? Here’s another question from our listeners I think would fit right here. They asked, “How do we engage in constructive interfaith discussions about the tough language that’s used to describe other faiths in the 1838 and 1842 accounts?”\n",

      "    <br/>\n",
      "    For instance, Joseph Smith—History 1:19, he said, “I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong. And the personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight, and that those professors were all corrupt.” In the 1842 account, he’s a little more concise, but he says, “They told me,” they meaning the Father and the Son, “that all religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines. None of them was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom, and I was expressly commanded to go not after them.” Casey and I have taken our swing in previous episodes to try to address this. What would you say? How do we engage in constructive interfaith discussion when you have this kind of tough language?\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Steven C. Harper:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah. That’s a terrific question. One way to approach it is to think of what you’re doing as an act of love, right? So it’s not a good idea to think of yourself as superior to some other Christian or person of any other kind of faith or no faith, but it is fine to think of some things as true and some things as not true and some things as less true. So if you had the truth, if you had the fact of the matter, if you knew it, or thought you did, that God had appeared to a young man in western New York and had ushered in a new gospel dispensation of fullness, then you would not be a true Christian if you didn’t offer that to every other person on this earth. You would not be a true follower of Jesus if you didn’t take that Pearl of Great Price and share it with every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. So we live in a hypersensitive time where we’re so worried about hurting feelings, and I’m not advocating being a jerk to other people, okay? And I would have people be aware here that Joseph Smith is hurting. He’s traumatized. And some of this language is the fruit of trauma, of a lifetime of being beaten, imprisoned, having his family subjected to terrible circumstances and his people be driven. A governor has issued an order saying, your people should be exterminated from my state. When that happens, you get defensive. So let’s give Joseph some slack. Notice that his other accounts are not as hostile in their language, but it’s still the case that he says, the Lord told me they were believing in incorrect doctrines. Well, that’s another way of saying that creeds are an abomination. The creeds are wrong about the nature of God and Christ. If you believe in the Restoration, that’s a fact. And if Latter-day Saints don’t offer that truth to our brothers and sisters everywhere else, we’re not acting very lovingly toward them. Now, we claim the privilege of worshiping God according to the dictates of our conscience, and we allow them the same privilege. And I should be at least as interested in what they have to offer me as I would like them to be in what I have to offer them. So I can’t—if I’m hypocritical, if I’m condescending, if I’m self-righteous or superior, I’m not following Jesus in my interfaith efforts or my ministry. But if I am trying to, sincerely as I possibly can, give to all of God’s children the things that are the most precious to me, then I can’t hold back from saying this is what I think is absolutely the truth, and I want to give it to you. I want you to have the opportunity to see if it’s what you have been looking for. And of course, for many, many people, it is. So I think we can’t hedge on the truths that have been restored through Joseph Smith, but we can be Christian in the way we engage our brothers and sisters in our interfaith dialogue. Casey’s actually really fantastic at this. I’m not so good at it myself. I’m more of a controversial person, but Casey’s really good at treating people the way he would like to be treated and offering all the truths that he knows and not expecting that he’s better than someone else or unwilling to listen to what they have to offer to us.\n",

      "    I’ll just offer an aw, shucks. That is a major compliment. Thanks, Steve. We’ve only got you for a few more moments, so I want to jump to a question. You wrote a wonderful article, and it’s tied to your Oxford book on the First Vision called Raising the Stakes. Talks about how over time the First Vision has increased in significance to Latter-day Saints, and I guess the question is—well, let me let me phrase it the way one of our listeners did: “Was it inevitable that members and leaders of the church would raise the stakes about the significance of the vision over the decades, and was that a helpful development? Do you think the First Vision should be the centerpiece, or should we have a broader perspective? What are the pros and cons?”\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Steven C. Harper:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Oh, yeah. Great. Cool questions. So that article argues that the First Vision’s place in our memory, our collective Latter–day Saint memory, is not inevitable, and it traces how that came to be. It might surprise some listeners to know that the First Vision was not first and foremost the fact of our story to the earliest Latter-day Saints, not for a couple of generations, and that it began to become so around 1880 when it became canonized in the Pearl of Great Price. But even then it took a couple of generations or more. So it was not inevitable. It was the result of several really important contingencies, decisions, choices, and I’ll just refer people to that article if they want to learn more about that. It’s free. I’m not trying to sell anything. It’s at byustudies.byu.edu. If you just Googled “raising the stakes BYU First Vision,” it would turn it up. So I think of history as way more interesting when I think of it as full of human agency. The interplay between God’s guarantees and human agency is fascinating to me: probably the most fascinating historical dynamic that there is. And so I don’t think of very many things as inevitable. I think of the ultimate outcomes of God’s promises as inevitable, but how we get there and the rollercoaster ride between here and there is full of human choices and contingencies that could go all kinds of ways, depending on what we decide to do.\n",

      "   <p>\n",
      "    Scott Woodward:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Love that. All right, here’s an impossible question to answer, but I want to know your thoughts on this, Steve. One of our listeners asked, “If we had an 1820 record of Joseph’s experience, would we be impressed by it? Would it be better than the later memories?”\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Steven C. Harper:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    I can’t answer the subjective parts of that because I just don’t know, but there are really interesting ways to think about that whole question. If we had an 1820 record of his experience, what we would notice is that it would be—overwhelmingly it would be factual memory. Like verse 21 of the Joseph Smith—History and the Pearl of Great Price, factual meaning it would record the things that Joseph experienced, or some of them. Not all of them, certainly. It would say things like, I read this verse, I went to the woods, I knelt where I—the place I stuck my axe. Who knows what else it would say, but it would have the facts, but it would have very little of the interpretive memory that you get in verses 22, 23, 24, because you can’t form that memory until you have space to look back on the experience and think about what it means, how to best interpret it. You don’t say things like, “I have often thought then and since,” right? You don’t have this 15-plus years of persecution to tie back to that original event. So if we had a journal entry, it would give us factual memory and maybe some initial reactions. Maybe it would say, yeah, I finally had my Methodist conversion experience just like the minister told me I would. Can’t wait to talk to him a few days from now, and I’m going to see him and tell him all about it. It would have that kind of short-term understanding of what just happened, but it wouldn’t have the longer interpretive framework. It wouldn’t tell us what it meant to Joseph over time. It would tell us what it meant to him at the time.\n",

You have studied the First Vision more than anyone that I know, probably more than anybody currently living, and we’re so thankful for your scholarship. How would you like to end? I mean, you’re a believer, Steve. Still, after having studied everything about the First Vision that there is to study, you’re still a believer.

      "    Steven C. Harper:\n",
      "    <br/>\n",
      "    Yeah, you’re right about that. I am a believer. I believe President J. Reuben Clark was right that the First Vision is a historical reality. I think that that is one of the most wonderful truths in the world. Jesus Christ is the sinless Son of God. He was resurrected from the dead. And not just that, they came again in this dispensation and restored their gospel, and it’s for everyone. It’s not for people who are currently Latter-day Saints and no one else. And that’s why we do this kind of stuff where we tell everyone the good news that we know, right? We’re not trying to tear anyone else down. We’re trying to do what Doctrine and Covenants 10 says, which is to “build up my church.” And when Jesus says that in that verse, he means Christianity. The restored gospel is the leaven of the Lord’s church across the whole earth. So I am grateful that we have the accounts of the vision. There’s so much rich evidence, and it all testifies that God is good. God is loving, right? There’s a deep question in Joseph’s mind about whether God is the Presbyterian version of the 1820s and before or the Methodist version. And another way of saying that is, is God damning me to hell, or is God offering me a chance at His grace if I reach out to Him? And the answer is God is offering me all of His grace if I reach out to Him. That’s what Joseph learned in the grove. That is the truth. God is good. God is full of love for all of us.\n",

And because of that, I know that there’s a God of love so that when I need to go and get forgiveness for my sins, I know where to turn. I know that I have a Savior and a Redeemer in Jesus Christ, who’s just as interested in us here now as He was ever in them there then.

Casey and I have both been studying and teaching Latter-day Saint church history topics in one way or another for over 20 years. So if you’re like us and can’t seem to get enough of church history, or if you’ve got questions on any of these topics we’re discussing and want to do a deep dive with us, then you’re in the right place. We’re excited and happy to have you along for the ride. For our first series, we chose to discuss Joseph Smith’s First Vision because that seemed like a great place to start. So here we go. Enjoy our first episode. Joseph Smith’s First Vision is foundational to our narrative of the Restoration today, but it was not always so from the church’s beginning. In fact, some early converts join the church without ever having heard of Joseph’s First Vision, since he seems to have rarely shared this experience publicly. So how did the First Vision go from what began as a very personal experience of Joseph’s to growing in institutional significance for the whole church as it has today? Joseph also wrote or dictated essentially four separate accounts of his First Vision over a 10-year period, from 1832 to 1842, and each account contains unique differences from the others, sometimes significant ones. Some details, like Joseph’s age at the time and the number of beings he saw in the vision can also be perceived as possibly contradictory or at least ambiguous. So how are we to make sense of these differences, possible contradictions, and ambiguities? And what role does our personal hermeneutic play in how we do so? Also, did you know that Joseph Smith’s first recorded account of his vision, written in 1832, was also his last account to come to light? It wasn’t rediscovered and made publicly available until the second half of the 20th century. What’s the story behind that? There’s also a letter Joseph Smith wrote to his wife, Emma, while he was stuck in Indiana, that has recently been suggested by one scholar as offering clues to the obscure historical context behind his 1832 account. What unique elements are explained by this new Indiana framing of the historical context? All of this and more coming your way on today’s episode of\n",

If Joseph Smith’s testimony of seeing God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ is not true, then Mormonism represents a false system of belief. But if this vision was reality, then the Church of Jesus Christ was and is restored on earth again.” So there you go. I think President Benson, if he was here, he would say, yeah, this is foundational. This is heart and soul of the church.

There’s a great article by Steve Harper called “Raising the Stakes: How Joseph Smith’s First Vision became All or Nothing,” where he talks about how in the early church, it doesn’t seem like the First Vision was held up as, like, the central or first thing that you teach everybody. Like, when I was a missionary in the late ’90s, we went to a person’s house, we introduced God and Jesus Christ, prophets, and then bam: First Vision.\n",

Did you say everything that happened, first of all?” “No. We only had a minute.” And then I say something like, “Would you have told the story differently if you were talking to a different person?

I believe he’s imperfect for sure, but, I believe he’s telling something that really occurred and something that’s very significant to him, and so when you come at it with a hermeneutic of trust, you’re now going to be reading these accounts and the differences in the accounts with trust. So, for instance, in the 1940s, Fawn Brodie, a woman who left the church and kind of on her way out of the church she wrote a book, a biography of Joseph Smith,\n",

Again, if you understand how historiography works, especially how—the church archives, I’ve got to be honest with you, weren’t always as well organized as they are today.

Some of these doctrinally amazing, like, watershed revelations that are just remarkable. Missionary work is going great. Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible’s proceeding very well. But on the other hand, Joseph and Sidney had been tarred and feathered in March of that year in Hiram, Ohio, and that caused Joseph Smith’s son to die that night. The door was left open when they dragged Joseph out of his home, and his son, who was already sick, just a baby at the time, because of exposure that night passed away. So Emma is grieving over that, and so is Joseph, of course, but Joseph needs to then leave and go to Missouri to attend to some of the business of the church over in Missouri.

More church members are in Missouri than in Ohio at this point. On their way back, they’re riding in a stage coach near Greenville, Indiana, and the stage coach has a runaway, and they have to jump out. And Joseph’s friend, Newell K.

They’re anxious to go home, but Newell can’t travel. He’s too badly beat up, and so Newell has to stay. Joseph Smith volunteers to stay behind with Newell in Greenville while everybody else goes on.

He writes her and says, “My situation is a very unpleasant one, although I will endeavor to be contented, the Lord assisting me. I have visited a grove, which is just in the back of town, almost every day, where I can be secluded from the eyes of any mortal and there give vent to all the feelings of my heart.” So he’s visiting a grove near town.

But as the letter continues, he brightens a little bit. Here’s the next thing that he writes: “But God is merciful and has forgiven my sins, and I rejoice that he sendeth forth the comforter unto as many as believe and humbleth themselves before him. I shall try to be contended with my lot, knowing that God is my friend. In him I shall find comfort. I’ve given my life unto his hands and am prepared to go at his call. I desire to be with Christ.” So there’s so many contextual clues there that maybe the reason why he writes his history down for the first time is he just has a moment to pause.

So it would make sense that while he has some time—he says in his letter to Emma, “I’ve called to mind all the events of my past”—that maybe he’s sitting down, trying to write it, which does suggest one compelling reason to write the history at this point. He might be writing the history for himself. He’s had so many difficult things happen, including Sidney Rigdon is really negatively affected by the mob attack. Later on in the summer, Sidney Rigdon is going to say some crazy things, and Joseph Smith is going to have to remove his preaching license for a little while. It’s possible that he’s writing this to remember that he has received a remission of his sins and that he has this divine call. I think that the possible audience for the 1832 history might be Joseph Smith: that he’s writing to make sense of his feelings and to work it out, because the indications are that the document we have right now, the one you’d see on the Joseph Smith Papers site was copied from some kind of earlier document. So Matt Godfrey’s theory is that he may have written it while he’s in Greenville, and then when he gets to Kirtland, he enlists Frederick G. Williams and records it in a more permanent form into this notebook that we have today as the 1832 account of the First Vision.\n",

This actually answers one of the big, classic attacks on the First Vision. Back in the 1950s there was a guy, Wesley Walters, who was an evangelical, who was kind of the first one to launch a sophisticated attack on the First Vision. Like, rather than just saying Joseph Smith was a liar, so the First Vision isn’t true, Wesley Walters used historical methodology to attack the First Vision. He looked up a bunch of Methodist records—and Joseph Smith mentions he was drawn to the Methodist sect—and says there was no Methodist revival in Palmyra in 1820.

It was based on your harvest and your planting seasons and everything like that. And if this is his first stab at the history and it’s 12 years later, It’s very understandable that he would be like, I’m not even sure how old I was when that occurred. Now, when he writes his 1838 history, which is intended for the public, he pins down the dates, okay? I mean, it’s in the spring of 1820. He still doesn’t know the exact day, but it was in the spring of 1820 when I was in my 15th year.

In fact, this is worth reading. This is what he records the Savior as saying. “He spake unto me, saying, ‘Joseph, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee. Go thy way. Walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments. Behold, I am the Lord of glory. I was crucified for all the world that those who believe on my name may have eternal life. Behold, the world lith and sin at this time, and none doeth good. No, not one. They have turned aside from the gospel and keep not my commandments. They draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me, and mine anger is kindling against the inhabitants of the earth to visit them according to their ungodliness and to bring to pass that which hath been spoken by the mouth of prophets and apostles.

Eyring came and dedicated that atrium, and when he dedicated it—this is the only place I’ve ever seen this. We have a little plaque there. President Eyring pointed out a really significant thing that we wouldn’t know if we didn’t have the 1832 I’ve been forgiven of my sins account. He said this, “The First Vision represents the moment when Joseph learned there was a way for the power of the Atonement to be unlocked fully. Because of what Joseph saw and what began at this moment, the Savior was able, through this great and valiant servant and through others that he sent, to restore power and privilege. That power and privilege allows us and all who will live to have the benefit of Jesus Christ’s Atonement work in our lives.” President Eyring’s kind of arguing the point that if the First Vision is the starting point of the Restoration, what’s the first thing that gets restored? And not necessarily priesthood or doctrine: that comes later. The first thing that has to be restored is our connection to the Savior and his Atonement. The power to be forgiven of sins. And I just love that idea, that the very first thing that’s restored in the course of the Restoration is the ability to receive forgiveness of your sins. That’s a neat insight to me.\n",

      "    He uses feeling words. He said he was feeling convicted for his own sins. He was mourning for both his sins and those of the world. He talks about his awe and pondering on the majesty of God. He mentions Jesus’s tender declaration that his sins were forgiven. Highly personal issue. He talks about how his soul was filled with love for many days thereafter, and how he pondered these things in his heart. This is very internal. This is Joseph’s internal world. And so just noticing context. Context, context, context.\n",

      "    And that makes this a real, like I said, hidden gem. It’s deeply personal. It may have been intended for the public. It may have not been intended for the public. At any rate, it’s really a great starting point to understand Joseph Smith and his perspective on God. And that letter to Emma Smith that we quoted earlier, I think, makes a sweet connection, too, that 12 years later he’s still wrestling with questions of worthiness, with questions of ability, with, hey, I’ve been asked to do this huge thing. Am I up to it? The First Vision helped give him the courage that he needed to keep doing what he was doing, to have the fortitude to move forward with what was always a really difficult prophetic mission, but he had confidence in his past experiences. There’s days when I have to look back and say, “Gosh, I don’t know if I can do what I have to do right now, but I’ve done things in the past that were beyond my capability with the Lord’s help. If he helped me then, I believe he can help me now.”\n",

      "    . Next week we continue this series on Joseph Smith’s First Vision by exploring his 1835 account, written as a journal entry about a conversation with an eccentric visitor who styled himself as a Jewish prophet. We will also explore the 1838 account, which was a public-facing, official history written under Joseph’s direction in Far West, Missouri in the aftermath of rumors, slander, and even death threats against Joseph and other Saints. As with the 1832 account, understanding the historical context surrounding the 1835 and 1838 accounts will help us make sense of why Joseph chose to share certain details about his vision in each account. Today’s episode was produced by Zander Sturgill and Nick Galieti, edited by Scott Woodward and Nick Galieti, with show notes and transcript by Gabe Davis.\n",
