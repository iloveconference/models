Richards of the Quorum of the Twelve \\nApostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints published a short \\nnotice in the Church’s European newspaper, The Latter-day Saints’ Millennial \\nStar, announcing the publication of “a new work which will soon be ready for \\nsale. ” This work was expected to be “a source of much instruction and edifi -\\ncation to many thousands of the Saints. ” The name Elder Richards gave this \\nnew volume was the Pearl of Great Price, taking his inspiration from Jesus’s \\nparable in Matthew 13:45–46. \\nWriting from Liverpool, England, Elder Richards informed readers in \\nthe preface to the first edition of the Pearl of Great Price that he felt the vol -\\nume was necessary because of “repeated solicitations of several friends of \\nthe publisher, who are desirous to be put in possession of the very import -\\nant articles contained therein. ” By compiling this collection of “revelations, \\ntranslations, and narrations” of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Elder Richards \\nhoped that members of the Church would “increase their ability to maintain \\nand to defend the holy faith” by becoming better informed of the “precious \\ntruths” revealed by the Prophet. “It would, ” he assured, “commend itself to all \\ncareful students of the scriptures. ” The content selected by Elder Richards for \\nthis new compendium included:\\n• Extracts from the book of Genesis and the Gospel of Matthew from \\nJoseph Smith’s inspired translation or revision of the King James Bible \\n(known today among Latter-day Saints as the Joseph Smith Translation)\\n• The book of Abraham, an inspired translation of some Egyptian papyri \\nacquired by the Prophet in the summer of 1835\\n• Extracts from the Prophet’s personal history composed in the summer \\nof 1838 and serialized in Church newspapers both in North America \\nand Europe beginning in 1842\\n• Extracts from the Doctrine and Covenants, one of the three canonical \\nbooks of the Church at the time (along with the Bible and the Book \\nof Mormon)', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='ii   |   Introduction\\n• An extract from an 1842 account of Joseph Smith’s history describing \\nthe foundational beliefs of the Church\\n• A poem composed by Elder John Jaques titled “Truth”\\nThe Pearl of Great Price was immensely valued by the Saints in Great \\nBritain, who then had convenient access to some of Joseph Smith’s most im -\\npactful revelations and historical writings. But it was not long until Elder \\nRichards’s pamphlet, which was intended primarily for British Latter-day \\nSaints far removed from the bulwark of Zion in Utah, grew beyond its initial \\naudience. By the end of the decade, the Pearl of Great Price was being cited in \\ngeneral conferences in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and it was eventually realized \\nthat a second edition would be necessary to satisfy increasing demand. Ac -\\ncordingly, in 1878 Elder Orson Pratt of the Quorum of the Twelve—with the \\nassistance of Elder Richards and fellow Apostles Elders Albert Carrington, \\nBrigham Y oung Jr., and George Q. Cannon—produced a second edition of \\nthe Pearl of Great Price that made significant revisions in both content and \\nstructure to the first edition while remaining true to the book’s original in -\\ntent. Two years later on Sunday, October 10, 1880—the fifth day of the Fif -\\ntieth Annual General Conference of the Church—President Cannon, First \\nCounselor in the First Presidency, proposed before the assembled body of \\nSaints that the Pearl of Great Price be sustained as  the Church’s fourth book \\nof scripture and be “binding upon us as a people and a Church. ” The proposal \\nwas sustained unanimously. \\nAfter its canonization, the Pearl of Great Price underwent three more \\nmajor editions: one produced in 1902 under the supervision of James E. Tal -\\nmage, another in 1921 under the supervision of Elder Talmage and other \\nmembers of the Quorum of the Twelve, and a third in 1981 (revised in 2013), \\nwhich is the current official edition of the Church. The 1902 edition prepared \\nby Elder Talmage standardized the contents of the Pearl of Great Price: the \\nbook of Moses, the book of Abraham, the “Writings of Joseph Smith” (lat -\\ner Joseph Smith—Matthew and Joseph Smith—History), and the Articles of \\nFaith. Two revelations added to the Pearl of Great Price on April 3, 1976, \\nwere moved a few years later in 1979 to the Doctrine and Covenants, becom -\\ning sections 137 and 138 of that book. Otherwise, the content of the Pearl of \\nGreat Price (including its versification), known and cherished by Latter-day \\nSaints today, has remained effectively the same for over one hundred years.\\nAlthough diminutive in size, the Pearl of Great Price has had a profound \\nimpact on the faith of the Latter-day Saints. It is a book of scripture that spans \\ndispensations. It reveals the grand scope of Creation as it unfolded under the \\ndirection of God and His Only Begotten; it reaches far back into the history \\nof God’s interactions with His children, preserving heretofore unknown ac -\\ncounts from the lives of Adam, Eve, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Moses; it \\nnarrates the calling of Joseph Smith as prophet, seer, and revelator in modern', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

Successive generations \\nof committed disciple-scholars who have closely studied the Pearl of Great \\nPrice have reaped a bountiful harvest, offering many important insights that \\ngreatly enhance appreciation for this remarkable text. Readers of the Pearl of \\nGreat Price today have access to a treasure trove of academic resources that \\nmake studying the text relatively easy and immensely rewarding.\\nTo help facilitate awareness of these resources and to provide a sense of \\nhow they might be usefully synthesized to increase faith and understanding, \\nthe creation of a study edition of the Pearl of Great Price felt both appropriate \\nand needful. The offering presented here, The Pearl of Great Price: A Study Edi -\\ntion for Latter-day Saints , hopes to satisfy the counsel given in Doctrine and \\nCovenants 88:118 and to help both new and longtime members of The Church \\nof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints magnify their study of this sacred text.\\nThe idea for this study edition had its genesis with the work of Book of \\nMormon Central, a nonprofit research foundation dedicated to making the \\nBook of Mormon accessible, comprehensible, and defensible to the entire \\nworld. In its early years, Book of Mormon Central focused exclusively on \\nmaking academic resources on the Book of Mormon accessible to a growing \\ndigital audience of curious and sometimes troubled Latter-day Saints who \\nwere encountering new information about their faith at a seemingly break -\\nneck speed. In 2019, Book of Mormon Central launched Pearl of Great Price \\nCentral—the first of several planned interconnected websites in a larger dig -\\nital ecosystem—that sought to do for the Pearl of Great Price what it had al -\\nready done for the Book of Mormon. By the end of 2020, Pearl of Great Price \\nCentral had produced dozens of short, informative articles on the individual \\nbooks of the Pearl of Great Price, extensive bibliographies and archival re -\\nsources, Y ouTube videos and podcasts, an online study edition of the book of \\nAbraham, and a digital book on Joseph Smith’s First Vision. With these and \\nother academic resources in mind (and, as mentioned above, with a desire to \\nraise the Saints’ engagement with the text), research associates and members \\nof the executive board of Book of Mormon Central felt a study edition of the \\nPearl of Great Price would be an excellent medium for delivering this content \\nto a broad general audience.', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='iv   |   Introduction\\nAlthough this study edition endeavors to be informative and offer \\ngrounded readings of the text, it does not presume to offer the final say on \\nhow to understand or otherwise interpret the individual books of the Pearl \\nof Great Price. Furthermore, the commentary offered herein has been delib -\\nerately kept short and focused so as not to draw readers’ attention away from \\nwhat matters most: the inspired scriptural text. As is true with any commen -\\ntary, there is much that had to be left unsaid and many avenues of thought \\nthat had to remain unexplored out of practical necessity. For example, the \\nmatter of how to harmonize the scriptural accounts of Creation or the his -\\ntorical lives of Adam and Eve with the findings of modern science has been \\nleft alone for the simple reason that the proper approach to these important \\ntopics requires the laying of more scholarly and exegetical groundwork than \\ncould be provided in the commentary offered herein. Similarly, because it is \\nthe prerogative of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apos -\\ntles to determine doctrine for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, \\nthis study edition has largely avoided providing doctrinal explication on the \\ntext. Because devotional and pastoral application of scriptural teaching is so \\ndeeply personalized to the needs of the individual, such has also been left  \\nalone in this study edition. The focus of the commentary provided in this \\nstudy edition is, consequently, predominantly historical, linguistic, text-crit -\\nical, structural, and theological—that is, this edition attempts to understand \\nthe broader significance of the text’s religious message. Both a general bibli -\\nography for the study edition as a whole and specific bibliographies for each \\nscriptural book in the text have been provided, and readers are encouraged to \\nconsult the sources contained therein as well as the resources available online \\nat pearlofgreatpricecentral.org for additional scholarly insight. \\nA NOTE ON THE TEXT  \\nThe text underlying this study edition of the Pearl of Great Price is the \\ncurrent (2013) official edition published by The Church of Jesus Christ of \\nLatter-day Saints. (With the kind permission of the Church, Book of Mor -\\nmon Central has been granted a license to use the current official edition of \\nthe scriptures in its study material.) To simplify readability, this study edi -\\ntion has repunctuated and reformatted the 2013 text with, for example, new \\nheadings to subdivide the text into meaningful narrative units. Otherwise, \\nit remains unchanged from the 2013 text. Significant or meaningful textual \\nvariants from past editions are noted and discussed in the commentary.', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The Book of Moses   |   1 \\nThe Book of Moses\\nIntroduction\\nHistory\\nIn June 1830—just months after the publication of the Book of Mormon on \\nMarch 26, 1830, and the founding of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day \\nSaints on April 6, 1830—Joseph Smith received an extraordinary revelation \\nconcerning a previously unknown incident in the life of the biblical prophet \\nMoses. This revelation brought to light “the words of God which he spake \\nunto Moses at a time when Moses was caught up into an exceedingly high \\nmountain” (Moses 1:1). This revelation, now known as the first chapter of \\nthe book of Moses, was the first tangible result of an inspired translation or \\nrevision of the Bible that the Prophet occupied himself with for at least the \\nnext three years of his life. The resulting text (known today as the Joseph \\nSmith Translation of the Bible but simply designated a “new translation” by \\nthe Prophet himself [see Doctrine and Covenants 124:89]), and especially \\nthe portion related to Genesis 1:1–6:13 now canonized as the book of Moses, \\nhas profoundly influenced Latter-day Saint theology. \\nThe content from Joseph Smith’s revision of the King James Bible pre -\\nserved today in the canonical book of Moses was revealed, or translated, \\nbetween June 1830 and February 1831. Assisting the Prophet as scribes in \\nthis portion of the work were Oliver Cowdery, John Whitmer, Emma Smith, \\nand Sidney Rigdon. By the spring of 1831, after the Saints had relocated to \\nKirtland, Ohio, this initial dictated manuscript, commonly designated Old \\nTestament Manuscript/Revision 1 (OT1), was copied and revised under the \\ndirection of Joseph Smith. It served as the base text from which the Prophet \\ncompleted the rest of his translation of the Old Testament, which is referred \\nto as Old Testament Manuscript/Revision 2 (OT2). However, some revisions \\ncontinued to be made to the original dictated manuscript as well. Whereas \\nOT1 reflects the Prophet’s initial prophetic outpouring connected to the Bible \\nrevision project, OT2, with its numerous revisions and emendations, appears', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2   |   The Book of Moses\\nto essentially reflect the final form of the text as intended by the Prophet. To -\\ngether, OT1 and OT2 constitute the earliest extant manuscripts of the book \\nof Moses (and the rest of the Joseph Smith Translation) and are profitably \\nstudied together to discern how the Joseph Smith Translation, including the \\nbook of Moses, grew out of an unfolding, “line upon line” revelatory process \\n(2 Nephi 28:30; Doctrine and Covenants 98:12).\\nIn addition to early manuscript copies of the text that circulated among \\nsome Latter-day Saints, portions of the book of Moses appeared in print as \\nearly as August 1832, when William W . Phelps published what is now Moses \\n7 in The Evening and the Morning Star  in Independence, Missouri. Addition -\\nal excepts from the book of Moses (including what is now designated Moses \\n5:1–16; 6:43–68; and 8:13–30) appeared in print not long thereafter. In the \\n1835 first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, excerpts from the transla -\\ntion of Genesis were quoted in the Lectures on Faith, further signifying the \\nimportance the early Saints attached to the Prophet’s biblical revisions. On \\none occasion Joseph Smith indicated that it was “not the will of the Lord” for \\nthe New Translation to be published serially as other histories or revelations \\nwere but that it would be published as a single volume instead. (The New \\nTestament was intended to also be published together with the Book of Mor -\\nmon.) He accordingly made serious though unfruitful efforts to publish the \\ntext in its entirety during his lifetime.\\nRecognizing the enormous value and doctrinal contributions of this text, \\nElder Franklin D. Richards included portions of the book of Moses in the \\n1851 first edition of the Pearl of Great Price, drawing from both previously \\npublished excerpts and, it appears, unpublished manuscript copies in circu -\\nlation at the time. Unlike the text’s current form, however, Richards’s version \\nbegan with Moses 6–7 and then followed with Moses 1–5, 8. The text un -\\nderwent further modification in the 1878 second edition prepared by Elder \\nOrson Pratt. Besides rearranging the contents of the book of Moses into its \\ncurrent order, Pratt utilized the published edition of the New Translation—\\nthe Inspired Version prepared by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of \\nLatter Day Saints (now the Community of Christ) in 1867—as the base text \\nfor this edition. It was this edition that would become canonized two years \\nlater, thus solidifying the basic structure of the text as read and appreciated \\nby Latter-day Saints today.\\nStructure\\nThe book of Moses is recited in both first- and third-person narrative voices. \\nThe text opens with a third-person narrator describing Moses receiving a \\nseries of grand panoramic visions in which God reveals to him details about \\nthe earth and its inhabitants as well as the wider Creation. This opening \\nchapter frames the ensuing narrative by depicting God as instructing Moses', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The Book of Moses   |   3 \\nto record the information He is about to give him concerning the Creation \\nand the early history of humanity (1:40–41; 2:1). Thereafter the text switch -\\nes to the first-person voice of God as He retells the stories of Creation, the \\nGarden of Eden, and the Fall of Adam and Eve in Genesis 1–3. At Moses 5:4, \\nhowever, the narrative voice reverts to the third person for the remainder of \\nthe canonical text. The cumulative effect of this narrative disjointedness blurs \\nthe lines between the primary narrators within the text (God and Moses) and \\nJoseph Smith as the modern prophetic intermediary who rendered it into the \\nfamiliar biblical idiom of the King James Bible for modern readers.\\nEmbedded in the narrative of the book of Moses is a series of visions and \\nrevelations given to the primeval ancestors of humanity. Readers thus en -\\ncounter revelations given to Moses (1:3–9, 24–41), Adam and Eve (6:51–68), \\nand Enoch (7:2–11, 23–59, 65–67) as they progress through the story. They \\nlikewise encounter sometimes lengthy discourses, most notably Enoch’s ex -\\ntended address at 6:40–7:1. Also woven into the narrative are artfully execut -\\ned literary and thematic elements, such as the stark moral dichotomies de -\\npicted between the wicked descendants of Cain (5:42–57) and the righteous \\ndescendants of Seth (6:10–25), or the juxtaposition of Adam as the proto -\\ntypical priest of God offering sacrifice in the similitude of the Only Begotten \\n(5:4–12) and Cain as the prototypical priest of Satan offering his brother as \\nhumanity’s first martyr (5:26–41). Poetic elements likewise feature in the text \\n(7:41, 48), as do irony (5:33) and immense pathos (7:28–37). As a literary \\nwork, the book of Moses is abundantly rich.\\nBeing, as it is, in part a revision of the text of the King James Version of \\nGenesis 1:1–6:13, the book of Moses, of course, parallels the familiar biblical \\nstories of the early chapters of Genesis. However, at several key points the text \\nradically departs from the biblical text, introducing new themes, doctrines, \\ncharacters, and narrative points. Satan, for example, who is absent from the \\nGenesis text, makes several open appearances in the narrative as the chief \\nantagonist of the drama (see Moses 1:12–23; 4:1–4; 5:13–15, 18–31). Like -\\nwise, the mention (and presence) of God’s Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, \\npervades the narrative. Although mentioned only briefly (and cryptically) at \\nGenesis 5:18–24, Enoch plays a significant role in Joseph Smith’s reworking \\nof the biblical material, prominently occupying nearly two chapters (Moses \\n6:26–7:69) out of the eight that presently constitute the book of Moses. The \\nprophet Noah, who otherwise utters not a single word of dialogue in the \\nGenesis text, is recast in the book of Moses as a preacher of righteousness \\nwarning the evil inhabitants of earth of the impending deluge (8:23–24). \\nThese expansions afford the book of Moses, in many points, a remarkable \\nresemblance to the so-called “rewritten Bible” tradition that flourished in \\nancient Judaism and Christianity (a point that has been appreciated by both \\nLatter-day Saint and non-Latter-day Saint commentators).', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='4   |   The Book of Moses\\nSignificance for Latter-day Saints\\nAs mentioned above, excerpts from Joseph Smith’s translation of Genesis \\nwere already circulating in print in the decades leading up to their inclusion \\nin the 1851 first edition of the Pearl of Great Price. Latter-day Saints both \\nthen and now have greatly cherished the book of Moses for the knowledge it \\nrestored about the lives and teachings of Adam and Eve and other antediluvi -\\nan personalities. Without question, the crowning truth revealed in the book \\nof Moses is the primacy of the gospel of Jesus Christ and that Adam and Eve \\nwere explicitly instructed directly by God in the foundational principles and \\nordinances of this gospel (5:4–12, 58–59; 6:51–68). This reconfiguration of \\nthe Genesis account to include plain mention of the salvific work of Jesus \\nChrist in the earliest stages of human history drastically impacts how Lat -\\nter-day Saints conceive God’s unchanging, eternal plan of salvation for all \\nHis children.\\nIn addition to making clear the primacy of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the \\nBook of Moses also prefigures the rise and triumph of Zion in the latter days. \\nAs narrated in the text, Enoch and his people attained such a level of holiness \\nin their Zion community that they ultimately enjoyed the blessing of transla -\\ntion into God’s own presence (7:18–22, 60–64, 68–69). The concept of Zion, \\nthe New Jerusalem, in Latter-day Saint religious consciousness can in no small \\nmeasure be traced back to this foundational text, which underpins the sub -\\nsequent revelations Joseph Smith received on the establishment of latter-day \\nZion in anticipation of the return of Enoch’s holy city at the Second Coming of \\nthe Son of Man (Moses 7:60–64; D&C 45; 97:18–28). The book of Moses has \\nlikewise greatly impacted Latter-day Saint temple theology and worship, and \\nan increasing consensus among Latter-day Saint scholars sees chapters 2–8 of \\nthe text as a temple text—an account of ritual ascent that is comparable with \\nthe account of Moses’s heavenly ascent in the opening chapter. \\nOne of the most profound passages in the book of Moses that affects the \\nLatter-day Saint understanding of the nature of God comes from Enoch’s \\nvision recorded at 7:23–40, wherein the prophet, to his great astonishment, \\nbeholds in vision God weeping in sorrow because of the abject wickedness \\nof His children. This moving display both refutes sectarian notions of an im -\\nmutable, impassible deity and reorients how Latter-day Saints imagine their \\nrelationship with God as their Father. Other vivid anthropomorphisms in \\nthe text (see Moses 1:6, 13, 16; 2:26–27; 6:57; 7:35) have become an integral \\npart of the scriptural foundation from which Joseph Smith and subsequent \\nLatter-day Saint thinkers have built compelling theologies concerning the \\nnature of God.\\nWith the modern rediscovery of forgotten or neglected ancient apoc -\\nryphal texts—texts that also narrate accounts of the lives of Adam and Eve, \\nEnoch, Noah, and other ancient prophets—Latter-day Saint scholars have,', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

The first line of OT1 iden -\\ntifies this text simply as “ A Revelation given to Joseph the Revelator June 1830. ” Scholars con -\\ntinue to wonder if Moses 1 is a standalone revelation or if it acts as a sort of preface to the rest \\nof the Prophet’s inspired revision of the book of Genesis. Moses 1:40 appears to indicate that \\nthe account preserved in this chapter is a sort of framing device for the subsequent narrative. \\nAlthough 1:40–41 indicates that Moses recorded his experience, without recourse to any an -\\ncient manuscripts it is unknown how much of this chapter is a restoration of lost text as op -\\nposed to Joseph Smith’s expansive revelation about an important (but otherwise unknown) \\nincident in Moses’s life. 1:1–2  Moses being “caught up” into a high mountain and beholding \\nthe glory of God face-to-face evokes a temple setting and context comparable to imagery at -\\ntested throughout the Hebrew Bible and other ancient sources. Latter-day Saint commentators \\nhave written extensively on this chapter, noting its similarity to other ascension texts wherein \\na prophet ascends into the presence of God and receives a divine commission. The striking \\nparallels between Moses 1 and this body of ancient literature are undeniable. (Consult the \\nbibliography for representative samples of this scholarship.) Saw God face to face.  Compare \\nExodus 33:11; Deuteronomy 34:10. Other prophets so privileged to have beheld the Lord “face \\nto face” include, but are not limited to, Enoch (Moses 7:4), Abraham (Abraham 3:11), Jacob \\n(Genesis 32:30), and Moroni (Ether 12:39). 1:3 Endless .

The status of Moses as a son of God will feature \\nprominently later in the narrative when Lucifer attempts to deceive Moses into worshipping \\nhim (1:12–13).

But in this context, the phrase likely implies more than mere divine parentage, \\nsignaling Moses’s status as a participant in God’s heavenly divine council. 1:5 The phrase “on \\nthe earth” is absent from OT1 and was inserted interlineally in OT2. The implication seems to \\nbe that anybody who experiences the full scope and extent of God’s eternal glory throughout \\nCreation cannot be withheld from a greater or more permanent level of deification, and there -\\nfore Moses was shown only a portion thereof. 1:6 Here the title of “Only Begotten” is invoked \\nfor the first time. This epithet will feature prominently throughout the rest of the book (see \\nMoses 2:1, 24–27; 3:18; 4:1, 3, 28; 5:7–9, 57; 6:52, 57, 59, 62; 7:50, 59, 62). As used in the New \\nTestament, the term derives from the Greek monogenēs  (with equivalents in Hebrew and Ar -\\namaic: yĕḥîd ) and is featured in other scripture as a title for Jesus (see John 3:16; Alma 5:48; \\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:23). It carries a sense of possessing a unique or special relation -\\nship to somebody else and otherwise of being “one of a kind. ” (Isaac is afforded this attribute \\nat Genesis 22:2 and Hebrews 11:17 even though Ishmael was his older half-brother.) No God \\nbeside me . See also Isaiah 45:5, 21–22; Hosea 13:4–5; Doctrine and Covenants 76:1. This dec -\\nlaration is an affirmation of God’s incomparable status as the Father of humanity and Lord of \\nCreation, not necessarily a declaration of His sole existence. Indeed, as depicted unmistakably \\nthroughout the text, besides God stands His Only Begotten Son. 1:8 Children of men . The \\nHebrew meaning of this term ( bĕnêy ʾadam ) is simply “mortals, humans” (compare Abraham \\n3:27) 1:10  Compare Joseph Smith—History 1:20, where the Prophet Joseph Smith reports \\nbeing similarly exhausted after his visionary experience. See also 1 Nephi 1:6–7; Alma 19:6.  \\n1:11  In the ancient mindset, encountering God or other divine beings was considered extraor -\\ndinarily dangerous and potentially fatal (see Exodus 33:20; Judges 6:22–23; 13:21–23), for \\nprecisely the same reason given here. 1:12  Satan appears in the narrative here for the first time thee, Moses, my son.

And where is thy glory, that \\nI should worship thee? 14\\xa0For behold, \\nI could not look upon God, except \\nhis glory should come upon me, and \\nI were transfigured before him.

For his glory has been upon me; \\nwherefore I can judge between him \\nand thee. Depart hence, Satan. ” \\n19\\xa0And now, when Moses had said \\nthese words, Satan cried with a loud \\nvoice, and ranted upon the earth, \\nand commanded, saying, “I am the \\nOnly Begotten. Worship me!” 20\\xa0And \\nit came to pass that Moses began to \\nfear exceedingly. And as he began \\nto fear, he saw the bitterness of hell. \\nNevertheless, calling upon God, he \\nreceived strength, and he command -\\ned, saying, “Depart from me, Satan, \\nfor this one God only will I worship, \\nand will be a prominent antagonist throughout the rest of the account, scheming to influence \\nthe lives of the children of Adam and Eve in deleterious ways. Son of man . Satan demotes \\nMoses’s status to that of a mere mortal in an attempt to command his allegiance, seemingly \\nunaware of God’s declaration at Moses 1:4. Moses counters in the next verse and at 1:16 by \\naffirming his ennobling status as a son of God in the “similitude” (that is, likeness or resem -\\nblance) of God’s Only Begotten. 1:15  Darkness unto me . Both OT1 and OT2 use the word \\n“blackness” instead of “darkness. ” This earlier reading may evoke a more visceral visual expe -\\nrience on Moses’s part (that is, Satan’s imitative glory is as the pitch blackness of night com -\\npared to the splendor and glory of God) and might relate to the “blackness” that characterizes \\nthe people of Canaan at 7:8 and the descendants of Cain in 7:22. (See also the commentary on \\nthese verses.) 1:17  This verse preserves one of God’s instructions to Moses otherwise unattest -\\ned in the Hebrew Bible (see Exodus 3). 1:18  OT1 and OT2 add “and it is glory unto me” after \\n“his glory has been upon me. ” 1:19  Satan ranted upon the earth . OT1 and OT2 both read that \\nSatan “wrent” upon the earth. This is most likely a variant of “rent” (the past tense of “rend”), \\nmeaning that Satan broke up the earth around Moses in a terrible display of fury. The change \\nto “ranted” occurred in the 1981 edition of the Pearl of Great Price. With either verb the im -\\nagery is basically the same: Satan, out of desperation and anger that Moses refused to worship \\nhim, lashed out in some type of terrifying display (see also 1:21). I am the Only Begotten . With \\nthis declaration, Satan desperately attempts to reassert his status as a once-ranking member of \\nthe divine council. He is, in effect, attempting still to subvert the Father’s plan even after his \\ndisastrous attempt to claim glory for himself in the premortal council (compare 4:1–4; Abra -\\nham 3:24–28).  1:20  Compare the description given by Joseph Smith of his encounter with', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

Two subsequent scribal edits \\nchanged this to “his Son” and then finally “the Only Begotten, ” the latter of which was used by \\nOrson Pratt in the 1878 edition and subsequent editions of the Pearl of Great Price. Moses’s \\ninvoking the name of the Only Begotten as opposed to the name Jesus Christ is more in har -\\nmony with the repeated mention of this title throughout the previous verses, which perhaps \\naccounts for the change. 1:22  Weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth is characteristic of Sa -\\ntan and those who share his eternal fate (see Mosiah 16:2; Alma 40:13; Doctrine and Cove -\\nnants 19:5; 101:91; 133:73). 1:24 The imagery of Moses lifting up his eyes to behold another \\nheavenly vision reflects a common biblical idiom sometimes used in visionary or quasi-vi -\\nsionary contexts (see Genesis 13:10, 14; 18:2; 22:4, 13; 24:63; 31:10, 12; 33:1; Exodus 14:10; \\nNumbers 24:2; Deuteronomy 4:19; Psalm 121:1; 123:1; Isaiah 40:26; see also the commentary \\nat Abraham 3:11–12). 1:25  Compare Exodus 7:1, where the Lord declares that Moses is “a god \\nto Pharaoh. ” The promise that Moses will have power over the waters is an obvious allusion to \\nthe parting of the Red Sea (see Exodus 14:21–31). 1:29  Moses beholds in vision many lands \\ncalled “earth. ” The immediate context and Moses 1:40 suggest that Moses is beholding many \\nlands and their inhabitants on this planet, with each land called “earth” (Hebrew: ʾereṣ , “land,', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",

Face to face . For a second time Moses beholds the \\nLord face-to-face. As with Abraham (in Abraham 3:11) the context is a visionary glimpse of \\nCreation. 1:32  The Only Begotten is identified as the Word of God’s power, anticipating the \\nprofound Logos hymn of John 1:1–18. 1:33  Compare Doctrine and Covenants 76:23–24. 1:34 \\nThe gloss provided in this verse identifies Adam as “many” (although the antecedent to “many” \\ncould also be “man” or “men, ” a reading that is reinforced by Moses 4:26).

This will feature more prominently later (at 2:26) and is in harmony with \\nthe book of Abraham’s depiction of Creation, which also speaks of more than one divini -\\nty participating (Abraham 4:1). 2:2 The earth being without form and void ( tôhû wā-bôhû ), \\nwith “darkness” ( ḥôšek ) being upon the face of the “deep” ( tĕhôm ), all evokes a sense of the \\ncosmos in its primordial, uninhabitable condition (compare Abraham 4:2). 2:3 My Spirit . The \\nHebrew word used in Genesis 1:2 for “spirit” ( rûaḥ ) can also mean “wind, breath. ” Alongside \\nthe presence of God’s Only Begotten and Word (Moses 2:5), it is difficult not to read the text \\nas describing the presence of each member of the Godhead in this scene. 2:4 OT1 has the de -\\nfinitive article “the” instead of the demonstrative “that” modifying “light. ” 2:5 OT1 has “Word” \\ncapitalized.

Image and likeness . Besides the obvious impli -\\ncations this language has for divine anthropomorphism and corporeality (compare Genesis \\n5:3; Ether 3:15–17), the language of humanity being in the image and likeness of God and His \\nOnly Begotten hearkens to the prevalent ancient Near Eastern practice of placing an image \\nof a deity in a temple or shrine. Here God and His Son are enshrined, as it were, in Their \\nnewly formed terrestrial temple—the earth—through the creation of humanity. Furthermore, \\nroyalty in the ancient Near East was sometimes said to be in the image or likeness of a given \\npatron deity, meaning the monarch had been endowed with a divine nature and was thus the \\nmortal representative of the deity on earth. This concept is democratized in here, in the book \\nof Abraham, and in Genesis to extend to all of humanity. Dominion over the earth . Humanity \\nis given dominion ( rādāh ; “to rule, have dominion”) over the forms of animal life heretofore \\ncreated, putting them in the role, essentially, of God’s viceroys on earth. Far from granting \\nhumanity license to exploit or abuse the earth’s ecology, humanity’s lordship over other forms \\nof animal life places on it a responsibility to treat the earth’s natural resources with care and \\nequity, as any monarch ideally would to its subjects. Wanton bloodshed, the needless taking \\nof life, and failure to show respect and restraint toward Creation is portrayed elsewhere in the \\ntext as Satanic (see Moses 5:31–33, 49–57). Male and female . Members of both sexes are said \\nto be made in the image of the God and His Only Begotten. This extends the divine nature of \\nGod to both men and women.

Scholars have proposed various etymologies for \\nthe name Eden, ranging from roots meaning “steppe, plain” to “pleasure, luxury” and “boun -\\ntiful, abundance. ” That the garden was intended to be envisioned as a place of paradisiacal lux -\\nury and abundance is reinforced by the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible known \\nas the Septuagint, which renders the word for “garden” in Genesis 2:8, 15 as paradeisos . 3:10 \\nThe beginning of this verse (“I, the Lord God, caused”) was inserted in OT2.

The land of Eden is said to have a river flowing out of it \\nthat splits into four branches. This indicates that the land is elevated since the rivers flow away \\nfrom it. Eden’s setting on a mount, or hill, evokes temple overtones. Indeed, based on this and \\nother details, multiple scholars have persuasively argued that the Garden of Eden functions as \\na prototypical temple and Adam as a prototypical temple priest. 3:11  OT1 and OT2 originally \\nboth read, “Where there were created much gold. ” The text was modified in OT2 to include \\n“the Lord” as the creative agent.

This intriguing interpretation of the Hebrew tardēmâ  (“deep sleep, \\nslumber”) suggests that the removal of Adam’s rib was a visionary experience rather than a \\nphysical one. Adam’s rib . The word used at Genesis 2:21–22 has traditionally been rendered \\n“rib” based in part on the ancient Greek ( pleura ) and Latin ( costa ) translations of this passage. \\nBut another possible translation is simply “side” ( ṣēlā‘ ).

Spiritually speaking, they died \\nat the time they ate the fruit, after which they would physically die at the end of their mortal \\nprobation (compare Helaman 14:16). 4:13–14  With their eyes now open to the reality of good \\nand evil, Adam and Eve recognize their vulnerability and nakedness before God’s presence \\n(compare Moses 4:16), whereas previously they had no such recognition (3:25; compare Gen -\\nesis 2:25). In response, they sew aprons (“girdles, loincloths”; ḥăgōrōt ) for themselves to cover \\ntheir nakedness and hide in the trees of the garden. Walking in the garden . In the Genesis \\naccount, Adam and Eve hide themselves when they hear the sound of God walking through \\nthe garden on a breezy day (Genesis 3:8).

The \\nrhetorical nature of the question has less to do with God somehow wondering where Adam is \\nand more to do with the former calling on the latter to account for his present circumstances. \\n4:20–25  As punishment for their respective roles in transgressing His command to not eat the \\nfruit of the tree, God dispenses punishments tailored to each participant: the serpent is to be \\ndebased and despised among the animals (a type for Satan), Eve is to bear children in pain \\n(ʿeṣev ), and Adam is to toil in hard labor as he supports himself and Eve. Notably, death is not \\ndecreed on either Adam or Eve as a punishment, suggesting that their foretold deaths (Moses \\n3:17) are perhaps not a God-ordained inevitability but a natural consequence of the Fall. 4:21  \\nThe antecedent to “he” at the end of this verse both here and in the biblical text (Genesis 3:15) \\nis the woman’s seed. OT1 follows the King James Version by using the pronoun “it. ” (OT2 \\ninitially follows OT1 but was revised to “he. ”) The Hebrew pronoun ( hûʾ) can mean either. \\n4:25 \\xa0The final injunction of this verse plays on both the meaning of Adam’s name (derived \\nfrom the Hebrew word for “ground, ” ʾădāma ̂) and the depiction of how God created Adam \\nat Moses 3:7 (compare Genesis 2:7). 4:26  The name Eve ( ḥawwa ̂) derives from the Hebrew \\nroot ḥyh, meaning “to live, ” and is related to the word ḥāy (“living, alive”) used immediately from the presence of the Lord God \\namongst the trees of the garden. \\n15\\xa0And I, the Lord God, called unto \\nAdam, and said unto him, ‘Where \\ngoest thou?’ 16 And he said, ‘I heard \\nthy voice in the garden, and I was \\nafraid, because I beheld that I was \\nnaked, and I hid myself. ’ 17 And I, the \\nLord God, said unto Adam, ‘Who \\ntold thee thou wast naked?

The rhetorical thrust of the question is to cast aside the power of the \\nLord and reject His authority. 5:17  Abel’s name in Hebrew ( hebel ) derives from the word for \\n“breath, vapor, ” perhaps foreshadowing that he will be “snuffed out, ” as it were, by his brother \\nas the first martyr and murder victim. 5:26–31 \\xa0The biblical record is notoriously laconic when \\nit comes to the motive behind Cain’s murder of Abel, saying only that he was “very wroth” with \\nhis brother on account of the Lord’s accepting Abel’s offering over his own (Genesis 4:5).

The King James Version of Genesis 4:25 has Eve giving \\nSeth his name and making this exclamation. The underlying Hebrew of this verse has Eve \\ngiving Seth his name but is somewhat ambiguous grammatically as to whether she or Adam \\nmade the exclamation (although contextually it seems to be Eve). Ancient versions (including \\nthe Septuagint and the Aramaic Targum Onkelos) clearly have Eve making the pronounce -\\nment. Interestingly, some apocryphal sources, such as the book of Jubilees, depict Adam as \\nnaming Seth and making the declaration. The name Seth ( šēt) derives from the word “to set, \\nappoint” ( šît), as reflected in the pronouncement that God “appointed” Seth to be a replace -\\nment to Abel (compare Genesis 4:25). 6:5–9  Genesis 5:1 mentions a “book of the generations \\nof Adam, ” but here the text greatly expands on this concept and restores details not present in \\nthe biblical record. Most notably, the text mentions a pure language spoken by Adam in which \\nhe instructed his family and kept a book of remembrance.

In his possession was a collection of Egyptian mummies and papyrus \\nscrolls. After exhibiting the antiquities to Joseph Smith on July 3, 1835, the \\nProphet determined that one of the scrolls contained the writings of Abraham \\nand another, the writings of Joseph of Egypt. He subsequently purchased at \\nleast four or five papyrus documents and four mummies from Chandler for \\nthe sum of $2,400 and set about efforts to translate the records. Precisely how \\nJoseph translated the papyri is unknown. Contemporary sources indicate \\nthat the Prophet translated the record by divine revelation (a few mention \\nthe Urim and Thummim in connection with the translation) but do not offer \\nmore specific details. \\nThe successive migrations of the Latter-day Saints from Ohio to Missouri \\nand then to Illinois in the late 1830s halted work on the book of Abraham. \\nDuring this time, Joseph Smith expressed his desire to continue translating \\nthe Egyptian records but was unable to because of pressing church and civic \\nduties. He was finally able to prepare a publishable version of the book of \\nAbraham in early 1842. The text and three accompanying facsimiles first ap -\\npeared serially for a public readership in Nauvoo, Illinois, in the Times and \\nSeasons  between March 1 and May 16, 1842. Later that year, the text (and the \\nfirst facsimile) was republished in the Millennial Star  in England for British \\nLatter-day Saints under the editorial supervision of Apostle Parley P . Pratt. \\nNine years later, in 1851, the book of Abraham was included in the first edi -\\ntion of the Pearl of Great Price and has appeared in each subsequent edition \\nof the book.\\nAfter his death in 1844, Joseph Smith’s collection of papyri and mum -\\nmies transferred to various individuals (including his mother, Lucy Mack', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 57}),\n",

Unlike any other book of Latter-day Saint scripture, the \\nbook of Abraham is appended by three facsimiles which serve to visually \\nillustrate the text’s narrative (Facsimiles 1 and 3) and draw readers into its \\ncosmology (Facsimile 2). \\nThe text ends abruptly in the Garden of Eden with Adam naming the \\nnewly created animals. Textual elements (see 2:21) and Facsimile 3 suggest \\nthat the narrative was on track to have readers eventually witness Abraham \\nin Egypt instructing Pharaoh’s court in matters of astronomy (indeed, the \\nvery astronomy being annunciated in the text, as indicated at 3:15). Themes \\nof priesthood, covenants, sacrifice, obedience, and Abraham’s aptitude as a \\nseer run throughout the extant narrative, suggesting that these elements too \\nwould have been prominent in the remainder of the account. Unfortunately, \\ndespite the explicitly stated intentions of Joseph Smith, no additional sto -\\nry content was published beyond what is extant. Some sources suggest that \\ntextual material beyond what appears in the published book of Abraham \\nhad been translated by the Prophet, but no such putative material was made \\navailable in print before his death on June 27, 1844.  \\nPeppered throughout the text are clearly recognizable Hebrew words \\n(see, for example, 3:13, 16, 18) that are undoubtedly the result of Joseph \\nSmith’s study of Hebrew under the tutelage of Joshua Seixas in the early \\nmonths of 1836. Likewise, key phrases in the text’s Creation account are ren -\\ndered in ways that are more in harmony with the underlying Hebrew of the \\nKing James Version of Genesis 1–2 (for example, the choice of “expanse” over \\n“firmament” at 4:6). These and other clues from the extant manuscripts sug -\\ngest that the Prophet was actively and consciously involved in shaping the \\nEnglish translation of the book of Abraham and not merely a passive agent \\nreceiving and channeling a pre-rendered text. Without the ability to check \\nthe English text against any purported ancient Abrahamic manuscript, \\nhowever, the precise nature of the translation of the book of Abraham', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 59}),\n",

Although other books of \\nLatter-day Saint scripture contain references to the concept of the pre-mor -\\ntality of humankind, it is Abraham’s vision recorded at 3:22–28 that captures \\nmost clearly a picture of the eternal identity of God’s children and their pur -\\npose here on earth. This cosmology is memorialized in the beloved hymn \\n“If Y ou Could Hie to Kolob, ” penned by William\\xa0W . Phelps, who scribed for \\nJoseph Smith during the text’s translation process. Drawing from the book \\nof Abraham’s description of the great star or planet nearest to the throne or \\nresidence of God (see 3:3–10), the hymn evokes contemplative reverence for \\nthe grandeur of eternity and the human soul’s yearning to progress back to its \\nFather’s presence, themes appropriately in harmony with Abraham’s account.\\nBesides offering a depiction of the pre-mortal council, the book of Abra -\\nham significantly augments how Latter-day Saints understand the Abraham -\\nic covenant. Elements missing in the Genesis account of Abraham’s covenant \\nwith God (Genesis 17) but preserved at Abraham 2:6–11 include the central \\nimportance of priesthood in the Abrahamic covenant and the culminating \\nblessings of eternal life. The book likewise expands how Latter-day Saints \\nconceive of Creation since the text departs in numerous ways from the con -\\nventional readings of the Creation account contained in Genesis 1:1–2:4. For \\nexample, the book of Abraham refashions the “days” of Creation into “times, ” \\nemphasizing the (apparently lengthy) periods of unfolding preparation in the \\nprocess of the earth’s creation (Abraham 4:1–5:3). The text likewise explicit -\\nly mentions the participation of multiple gods counselling together as they \\nundertook Creation (4:1), a detail hinted at in the Genesis account (Genesis \\n1:26–27) but prominently narrated in the book of Abraham (for example, \\n4:26–27; 5:2–3). \\nThe book of Abraham’s portrait of the ancient world of the patriarch’s day \\nand its expansive cosmology have piqued the curiosity of generations of Lat -\\nter-day Saint writers who have sought ways to make sense of this sometimes \\nperplexing text. While much about the book of Abraham remains elusive—\\nnot the least being the precise relationship the translated text shares with \\nthe papyri scrolls obtained by the Prophet Joseph Smith—scholars have been \\nable to piece together a plausible ancient context and setting for the book \\nthat makes it much more comprehensible and enriching.

The writings of Abraham . The heading as published in the T&S  describes the text as “pur -\\nporting to be the writings of Abraham. ” The phrase “purporting to be” was dropped in the \\n1878 edition of the Pearl of Great Price. This should not be taken to mean Joseph Smith or \\nthose who assisted him in the translation of the book of Abraham doubted or questioned the \\nauthenticity of the text. Rather, “purport” in the Prophet’s day merely meant “to mean, to sig -\\nnify. ” By his own hand . The idiom “by the hand”  is attested as an ancient Egyptian idiom to \\ndenote authorship and agency. It also appears in the Hebrew Bible (see, for example, Haggai \\n1:1; 2:1; Zechariah 7:7, 12; Malachi 1:1) to denote the prophetic agent issuing the word of the \\nLord (compare 1 Corinthians 16:21; Galatians 6:11; Colossians 4:18; 2 Thessalonians 3:17; \\nPhilemon 1:19). The phrase “written by his own hand, upon papyrus, ” accordingly need only \\nbe taken here as attributing authorship of the text to Abraham, not necessarily as a declaration \\nthat Abraham physically wrote the papyrus manuscripts acquired by Joseph Smith.

Although Joseph Smith intended to translate and publish more text, he unfortunately \\ndid not accomplish that before his death. The location of Abraham’s Ur of the Chaldees (see \\nAbraham 1:20; 2:1–4; compare Genesis 11:27–32) is disputed. The most popular candidate for \\nAbraham’s Ur is Tell el-Muqayyar in southern Iraq.

Other -\\nwise, it is called an “offering” or “thank-offering” (1:9–10). The extent to which peoples of the \\nancient Near East practiced what is sometimes today called “human sacrifice” remains debat -\\ned. Ritual or sacred violence is attested among the Egyptians of Abraham’s day in the form of \\nexecration rituals in which enemies and other threats to Egypt were ritually destroyed. These \\nrituals were mainly carried out on effigies but in at least one documented case on an actual \\nhuman victim.

The structure of the covenantal pattern evolved over \\ntime, but typically featured a solemn oath or ceremony, a preamble, a historical prologue, \\nnamed witnesses to the covenant, stipulations, promised blessings for keeping the covenant, \\nand promised curses for breaking the covenant. The covenant Abraham enters with God here \\nfeatures several of these elements, including a solemn ceremony (Abraham 2:6), a preamble \\n(2:6–8), stipulations (2:9–10), and blessings and curses (2:11).

Therefore, see that ye \\ndo on this wise: 24\\xa0let her say unto \\nthe Egyptians, she is thy sister, and \\nthy soul shall live. ” 25\\xa0And it came to \\npass that I, Abraham, told Sarai, my \\nwife, all that the Lord had said unto \\nme, “Therefore say unto them, ‘I pray \\nthee, thou art my sister, that it may \\nbe well with me for thy sake, and my \\nsoul shall live because of thee. ’”\\nAbraham Receives a \\nRevelation by the Urim and \\nThummim\\n3 And I, Abraham, had the Urim \\nand Thummim, which the Lord \\nmy God had given unto me, in \\nUr of the Chaldees. 2\\xa0And I saw the \\nstars, that they were very great, and \\nthat one of them was nearest unto the \\nof Joshua as a city captured by the Israelites (Joshua 7–8). 2:21 \\xa0The motivation for the journey \\nto Egypt is, as with the motivation to leave Haran, to escape a famine. In the extant text of the \\nbook of Abraham, however, the patriarch never actually sets foot in Egypt. 2:22–25 \\xa0Unlike in \\nthe parallel account in Genesis 12:11–13, here the Lord instructs Abraham to call Sarai his \\nsister instead of his wife. The concern behind this subterfuge is clear from the text. Given that \\nancient Egyptian texts depict pharaohs as taking any women they wanted, and given the ca -\\npacity for callousness in ancient royalty, this fear was not unrealistic. The text is taking advan -\\ntage of an ambiguity in ancient Egyptian language and culture. In ancient Egyptian, the word \\nfor wife (ḥmt) meant “wife, ” but the word for sister  (snt) could mean either “sister” or “wife. ” In \\nany case, Genesis 20:12 identifies Sarai as Abraham’s half-sister. The Lord was thus not in -\\nstructing Abraham to lie but rather to be evasive or purposefully ambiguous. Interestingly, a \\ntext recovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls depicts Abraham as being warned of this impend -\\ning danger in a dream.\\n3\\xa0This chapter features some of the more distinctive (and important) elements of Latter-day \\nSaint cosmology. The depiction of Kolob, a great star (or planet) nearest to the throne of God, \\nand some of the most explicit details in Restoration scripture about the premortal council in \\nheaven are derived from this chapter. 3:1–2 \\xa0Urim and Thummim . Abraham is said to have had \\nthe Urim and Thummim, by which he communicated with God. Note that Abraham does not \\nnecessarily see his cosmic vision through the Urim and Thummim but rather seems to use it \\nto, at a minimum, speak with God (Abraham 3:4). That Abraham’s Urim and Thummim was \\nthe same as the one possessed by the brother of Jared (Ether 3:21–28) is unlikely. Rather, it \\nseems more probable that Abraham possessed a separate seeric or oracular instrument that \\nwas rendered as “Urim and Thummim” by Joseph Smith in his translation.

Ancient and medieval sources report that Abraham was knowledgeable in the \\nastronomical sciences. Some of these sources even depict Abraham as bringing a knowledge \\nof mathematics and astronomy to Egypt. 3:3\\xa0Kolob . Here Kolob is mentioned for the first time. \\nIn the text it is said to be a star or planet; a “great [star/planet]” and a “governing one”; “nigh \\nunto the throne of God”; used to tell relative time (Abraham 3:4); and a signifier of “first cre -\\nation” (Facsimile 2, fig. 1). The name arguably derives from the reconstructed Afroasiatic root \\n*ḳlb/ḳrb , meaning “interior, inside, middle. ” Descendent cognates that likely relate to Kolob \\nare attested in Egyptian ( ḳꜢb; “interior, midst”), Akkadian ( qerbum ; “inside”), and Hebrew \\n(qereb ; “inside, middle”). Alternatively, the name Kolob might derive from the Semitic root \\nklb, meaning “dog” (as in the Akkadian kalbu  or Hebrew keleb ), and might thereby be identi -\\nfiable with the dog-star Sirius, which held especially significant calendrical and religious sig -\\nnificance for the ancient Egyptians. The converging characteristics between Kolob and Sirius \\nare compelling (for example, Sirius was recognized as a great star by the ancients, served an \\nimportant calendrical and timekeeping purpose, was depicted as being a ruling star, and so \\non) but this identification remains unconfirmed. Near unto God . An important theme in this \\nchapter is the relative proximity of graded stars to God’s celestial residence. Kolob is repeated -\\nly said to be nearest to the throne of God (here and at 3:9–10, 16), thus making it the greatest \\nof the governing astronomical bodies. If Kolob does indeed derive from the root *ḳlb/ḳrb,  \\nthen this emphasis on its nearness and proximity to God would work well as a pun on the \\nname. 3:5–10 \\xa0Geocentric cosmology . The “order[s]” and “set time[s]” of celestial objects (the \\nmoon, the sun, other planets, and Kolob) are enumerated from Abraham’s vantage point on \\nearth (“upon which thou standest”).

As \\nEnoch (Moses 7:4; Doctrine and Covenants 107:49) before him and Jacob (Genesis 32:30) and \\nMoses (Exodus 33:11; Moses 1:2, 31) after, Abraham receives a dramatic theophany (compare \\n2:6). The parallel language with Moses’s theophany on the mount is especially striking. Abra -\\nham the seer .

The word is clearly recognizable as \\nthe Hebrew word for “everlasting, eternal” ( ʿolam ). In Genesis 21:33 Abraham plants a tama -\\nrisk tree at Beer-Sheba and dedicates it to “the everlasting God” ( ʾel ʿolam ). The eternity of \\nspirit or intelligence was a teaching the Prophet Joseph Smith emphasized in the final years of \\nhis ministry, including in his now-famous King Follett Sermon of April 7, 1844. 3:22–23 \\xa0Abra -\\nham is shown the premortal intelligences that were “organized” into the premortal divine \\ncouncil. These intelligences or spirits are described as “noble and great ones” and are decreed \\nby God to become “rulers” in mortality because they are good. Abraham is identified as one of \\nthese noble and great spirits. This evokes depictions of the divine council of God and His at -\\ntending divine beings (called, variously, gods, the sons of god[s], angels, holy ones, and so on) \\nin the Hebrew Bible and other ancient Near Eastern texts. Furthermore, it subtly plays on (and \\nsubverts) ideas in ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian religion that kings were divinely fore -\\nordained by the gods to be rulers.

Unlike traditional Jewish and Christian teaching, the text at Abraham 3:24 \\naffirms creation from preexisting matter, not creation ex nihilo , or from nothing. In creation \\nmyths from Abraham’s day, Creation was often envisioned as an act of divine fashioning of \\nchaotic elements (typically a primordial cosmic ocean). This, indeed, is how Genesis 1:1–3 \\nenvisions Creation. The purpose of mortality . At Abraham 3:25 an important purpose is given \\nfor why the earth was created and populated with the premortal spirits: to see if they would \\nobey the commands of the Lord God, the supreme intelligence. From other scripture, it is clear \\nthat this test of obedience is part of the Lord’s work to bring to pass the immortality and eter -\\nnal life of humankind (see Moses 1:39). The first estate . The language of Abraham 3:26 is ap -\\npropriated from Jude 1:6, which speaks of angels who did not keep their “first estate” (more \\nliterally, their “own position [of authority]”; eautou archē ) but instead were destined for dam -\\nnation. The point made in the text here is that those intelligences who excelled in their “first \\nestate” (premortal, disembodied state) by adhering to the Lord’s commandments would have \\n“glory” (eternal life and exaltation) added upon them if they successfully traversed their “sec -\\nond estate” (probationary mortality). It is, in effect, a concise formulation of the plan of salva -\\ntion. The Son of Man . In biblical Hebrew, the phrase “son of man” ( ben ʾadam ) connotes “mor -\\ntal, human. ” It is used prominently in the book of Ezekiel when God addresses the prophet and \\nalso in Moses 1:12 when Satan denigrates Moses. In later apocalyptic works, most notably \\nDaniel (especially 7:13–14), the Son of Man (Aramaic: bar ʾenash ) is an eschatological figure \\nwho assumes rulership over the earth at the end of days. Believed by His disciples to be this \\nvery eschatological figure (compare Revelation 1:13), Jesus is identified as the Son of Man in \\nnumerous instances throughout the canonical Gospels. In the book of Moses (6:57; 7:35), one \\nof the Adamic names for God the Father is revealed to be Man of Holiness. The identity of the \\npremortal Jesus as “one like unto the Son of Man” at Abraham 3:27 might be understood si -\\nmultaneously in these contexts: He is the Firstborn of the Man of Holiness (compare Doctrine \\nand Covenants 78:20; 93:21–22; 95:17), one who condescended to become a mortal (compare \\n1 Nephi 11:14–36), and the foreordained millennial King (compare Revelation 19:15–16). The \\nfall of Lucifer . At 3:27–28 the fall of Lucifer is briefly narrated (compare Moses 4:1–4; 2\\xa0Nephi \\n2:17–18). Upset that he was not selected to be the Father’s redemptive emissary, Lucifer (here \\nleft unnamed, merely identified as “another” or “the second”) becomes angry and draws many \\nof the premortal intelligences away with him.

And \\ndarkness reigned upon the face of the \\ndeep, and the Spirit of the Gods was \\nbrooding upon the face of the waters.\\n4\\xa0The book of Abraham’s account of the Creation significantly impacts how Latter-day Saints \\nunderstand this important theological subject. The more noteworthy elements introduced by \\nthe book of Abraham include creation by organizing preexisting matter, multiple Gods (the \\ndivine council) participating in the process, and the seeming fact that the periods (“days”) of \\nCreation were less temporally definite. The Creation account here directly follows the divine \\ncouncil scene of Abraham 3:24–28 and should indeed be read as the narrative continuation \\nof that scene. The modern chapter divisions for the text were introduced in 1902 by James\\xa0E. \\nTalmage. As it appeared in the T&S  under the editorship of Joseph Smith and as it appeared \\nin the 1851 first edition of the Pearl of Great Price, there was no chapter division between 3:28 \\nand 4:1. Read as one continuous narrative, the divine council decides on a course of action \\nin 3:24–28 and then executes that decision beginning here. (See further the commentary for \\nMoses 2.) 4:1\\xa0Let us go down . The cohortative language here clearly parallels Genesis 1:26; \\n11:7. As so used both here and in Genesis, it signals the execution of group action. In the bib -\\nlical Creation narrative of Genesis 1, God does not enlist the effort of the divine council until \\nthe creation of humankind. Here, however, and in the book of Moses (2:1), the divine council \\nparticipates in Creation from the earliest steps. The Gods.  As with the glosses earlier in the \\ntext (at, for example, Abraham 1:7, 9, 12, 14, 20, 23; 2:11), it is not clear if these explanatory \\ncomments were original to Abraham or introduced by Joseph Smith or his scribes. In either \\ncase, the text departs from the Genesis account by explicitly introducing multiple divinities \\nas being involved in the creative process. Organized and formed . The text explicitly rejects no -\\ntions of creation ex nihilo by employing the verbs “organize” and “form” throughout. Although \\ndeparting from traditional Jewish and Christian ideas of Creation, this absence of creation \\nex nihilo grounds the book of Abraham more comfortably in the milieu of the ancient Near \\nEast during Abraham’s day. It also more closely aligns the text with the underlying Hebrew of \\nGenesis 1. This may likely be, in part, the result of Joseph Smith’s study of Hebrew under the \\ntutelage of Joshua Seixas in Kirtland, Ohio, in the early months of 1836. As with the Hebrew \\nterminology that appears in the text (see, for example, Abraham 3:13, 16, 18) and the explana -\\ntions to the facsimiles (see, for example, Facsimile 1, fig. 12; Facsimile 2, figs. 4–5), it appears \\nthat the Prophet’s rendering of this Creation account was influenced by his knowledge of He -\\nbrew. It remains uncertain to what extent his secular learning helped shape the articulation \\nof this revelation—or, conversely, to what extent the revelation itself, as tailored by a divine \\ninfluence, was adapted for or integrated with Joseph Smith’s growing knowledge of ancient \\nlanguages. 4:2\\xa0The formation of the earth .

Often rendered as \\n“soul” (or left untranslated), the Ba essentially constituted the nonmaterial \\nessence of an individual (their personality, character, reputation, their “self, ” \\nand so on). Gods also had a Ba that could be detected in any phenomenon \\nor action, which demonstrated the given deity’s presence or essence. The Ba \\ncould freely come and go after death and could even be sent and commanded \\nto perform certain tasks (such as deliver messages or appear in dreams) if \\nproperly ordered. For this last reason, it seems, in the Greco-Roman period \\nthe Ba was sometimes rendered in Greek as “assistant, attendant” ( paredros ) \\nand was conceptualized in parallel function with “messengers” ( angeloi ). \\nThis figure corresponds to the “angel of [the Lord’s] presence” described at \\nAbraham 1:15; 2:12, who rescues the patriarch from death.\\nFigure 2 .

       " Document(page_content='88   |   The Book of Abraham\\nCommentary on Facsimile No. 2\\nFacsimile 2 of the book of Abraham is a type of Egyptian document called a \\nhypocephalus. The name derives from Greek ( hypo tēn kephalēn ) and means \\nliterally “under the head” (corresponding to the Egyptian ẖr tp ). The hypo -\\ncephalus was a specialized funerary amulet that was placed under (or some -\\ntimes just near) the head of the deceased and served to protect the deceased \\nin the afterlife, provide light and heat for the deceased, and to transform the \\ndeceased into a resurrected divine being. Hypocephali also served as astro -\\nnomical documents, functioning as a type of guide through the cosmos for \\nthe deceased. The hypocephalus that served as the basis for Facsimile 2 was \\nowned anciently by a man named Sheshonq, whose name appears in fig. 8, \\nand most likely dates to the Ptolemaic period.\\nFigure 1.  Kolob, signifying the first creation, near -\\nest to the celestial, or the residence of God. First in \\ngovernment, the last pertaining to the measure -\\nment of time. The measurement according to celes -\\ntial time, which celestial time signifies one day to \\na cubit. One day in Kolob is equal to a thousand \\nyears according to the measurement of this earth, \\nwhich is called by the Egyptians Jah-oh-eh.\\nKolob features prominently in the cosmology of the book of Abraham as a \\nstar or planet nearest to the residence of God (see Abraham 3:3–10). As with \\nthe explanation to this figure, Kolob in the text of the book of Abraham is \\nsaid to have timekeeping significance (Abraham 3:9). The comment that ce -\\nlestial time “signifies one day to a cubit” is perplexing, but perhaps is meant \\nto describe angular velocity, or the speed at which an object revolves relative \\nto another object (in this case the orbits of celestial bodies). According to \\nthis understanding, the movement of Kolob (assuming it is intended to be \\na physical star in the visible night sky; see the commentary accompanying \\nAbraham 3:3) is being measured in cubits, an anciently attested phenome -\\nnon for other celestial bodies. In its Egyptian context this figure is commonly \\nidentified in other hypocephali as the god Amun (or Amun-Re), a supreme -\\nly important deity in ancient Egypt as the primeval, self-generating creator \\ngod whose name means “hidden one” ( ỉmn). Although usually depicted in \\nhypocephali with four heads, representing the universality and totality of \\nthis god’s power over the cosmic elements, here the figure has two heads, as \\nalso attested in other hypocephali.

Embedded in \\nthis lengthy revelation is a recitation of and expansion on Jesus’s Olivet Dis -\\ncourse as recorded in Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21 (Doctrine and Cov -\\nenants 45:15–59). This section is prefaced with the Lord’s declaration that He \\n“will speak unto you and prophesy, as unto men in days of old” and would \\notherwise “show it plainly as I showed it unto my disciples as I stood before \\nthem in the flesh” (45:15–16). After rehearsing this material—consisting of \\nJesus’s prophecy of the destruction of the Jerusalem temple, the scattering \\nof the Jews, and the signs of His return as the glorified Son of Man—the \\nLord instructed the Prophet to commence translating the New Testament as \\npart of his inspired revision of the Bible (now called the Joseph Smith Trans -\\nlation) that he had begun that previous summer (45:60–61). With Sidney \\nRigdon as his scribe, Joseph began producing his “Translation of the New \\nTestament translated by the power of God” (so designated in the head to the \\noriginal manuscript) the next day, March 8, 1831, leaving off where he had \\nreached in his revision of the Old Testament (Genesis 24:41).\\nIt is not known precisely when Joseph Smith reached Matthew 24 in this \\n“new translation” of the Bible (as he himself called it), but it certainly would \\nnot have been much longer after he began revising the New Testament on \\nMarch 8. As with his translation of the opening chapters of Genesis that is \\nnow canonized as the book of Moses, the Prophet originally dictated his re -\\nvision of Matthew 24 to Sidney Rigdon, who captured the dictation in what is \\nnow commonly designated New Testament Manuscript 1 (NT1, which cov -\\ners Matthew 1:1–26:71). Shortly after this initial translation work, on April 4, \\n1831, Church historian and recorder John Whitmer began producing a copy', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 106}),\n",

This manuscript, commonly designated New Testa -\\nment Manuscript 2 (NT2), underwent additional revisions as the Prophet \\nrefined the project, including the material that had been previously produced \\nwith Rigdon in NT1.\\nAs with his translation of the content in the book of Genesis that is now \\nthe book of Moses, early Latter-day Saints quickly recognized the signifi -\\ncance of the Prophet’s revision to Matthew 24. In the mid-1830s, what is \\nnow designated Joseph Smith—Matthew appeared in print and circulated in \\nthe form of a standalone “broadside” (a handbill), which was subsequently \\nrecopied in other contemporary publications such as John Corrill’s 1839 A \\nBrief History of the Church of Christ of Latter Day Saints  and the first edition \\nof the Pearl of Great Price, prepared by Elder Franklin\\xa0D. Richards in 1851. \\nThere it appeared as “ An Extract from a Translation of the Bible” alongside \\nthe extracted material from Joseph Smith’s revision of Genesis (also circu -\\nlating in print during the Prophet’s lifetime), and it has appeared in each \\nsubsequent edition of the Pearl of Great Price.\\nStructure\\nAlthough Joseph Smith—Matthew is commonly referred to as a translation \\nor revision of Matthew 24, it in fact begins at Matthew 23:39 with a brief \\nnarrative that frames the discourse. Following the Gospel of Matthew, Jo -\\nseph Smith—Matthew narrates Jesus finishing His lamentations over Jeru -\\nsalem, leaving the city and crossing the Kidron valley, and delivering the \\ndiscourse on the Mount of Olives (see, respectively, Matthew 23:37–39 and \\nJoseph Smith—Matthew 1:1; Matthew 24:1–2 and Joseph Smith—Matthew \\n1:2; Matthew 24:3 and Joseph Smith—Matthew 1:4). As also with Matthew, \\nJoseph Smith—Matthew presents this discourse as a response to the disci -\\nples’ inquiring of Jesus concerning the signs of His coming (Matthew 24:3; \\nJoseph Smith—Matthew 1:4).\\nOne of the most pronounced revisions Joseph Smith—Matthew makes \\non the biblical version of this discourse is to more clearly present Jesus as \\naddressing two separate, consecutive events: (1) the destruction of Jerusalem \\nand its temple and the scattering of the Jews; (2) His return as the triumphant \\nSon of Man. The pivot appears at around Joseph Smith—Matthew 1:21, al -\\nthough it is still not entirely clear where to precisely demarcate when Jesus \\nis prophesying events in the first century AD and when He is prophesying \\nevents related to His Second Coming. Blurring this even more is the repe -\\ntition of some events or themes in both timelines, such as the desecrating \\nsacrilege (the “abomination of desolation” mentioned at 1:12, 32), or the rise \\nof false Christs (1:6, 22), or the spread of iniquity (1:10, 30).

The first, the parable of the car -\\ncass and eagles (or vultures) at Joseph Smith—Matthew 1:27, concerns the \\ngathering of the elect. The second, the parable of the fig tree at 1:38–39, em -\\nphasizes the need to be watchful for the signs of Jesus’s return. The third, \\nthe parable of the thief in the night at 1:47–48, warns that the disciples must \\never be on their guard lest they be caught unprepared at their Lord’s return. \\nThe fourth and final parable (at 1:49–55) provides contrasting portraits of \\ngood and evil servants and their respective rewards at the Lord’s coming. In \\neach case the parable is followed by additional instruction that develops the \\nrespective intent. Quotations of or allusions to texts from the Hebrew Bible \\nare also peppered throughout this discourse, reinforcing the prophetic impli -\\ncations of these passages. \\n Significance for Latter-day Saints\\nThe Latter-day Saint concern for eschatology, or the theology of the last days \\nand the final destiny of humanity, arose early in the restored Church of Jesus \\nChrist. Several of Joseph Smith’s canonized revelations in the Doctrine and \\nCovenants (for example, sections 1, 29, 43, 45, 84) elaborate on the signs and \\nevents leading up to the return of Jesus Christ to the earth, the Millenni -\\num, and related doctrines. The millenarian worldview of the early Saints was \\ngreatly informed both by the Prophet’s revelations and also by his revising of \\nbiblical prophecies, including those recorded in Matthew 24.  \\nAlthough the Lord’s warnings to His disciples in the Olivet Discourse are \\ngrave, their intention is not to frighten but rather to inform and, ultimately, \\nencourage. The promise extended to faithful, watchful Saints in the last days \\nis that their diligence and precaution will be rewarded with their joining the \\nLord at His coming and their triumph over the wicked (see Joseph Smith—\\nMatthew 1:37, 55). Read in this light, Joseph Smith’s revisions to the Olivet \\nDiscourse ultimately reaffirm the relevance of the Lord’s promises to His an -\\ncient disciples and to modern Saints: that once the earth finds its millennial \\nrest, He “shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he will \\nbe their king and their lawgiver” (Doctrine and Covenants 45:59).\\nSelected Bibliography\\nAnderson, Richard L. “Joseph Smith’s Insights into the Olivet Prophecy: \\nJoseph Smith and Matthew 24. ” In \\xa0Pearl of Great Price Symposium: \\nA Centennial Presentation (22 November 1975) , 48–61.

It refers to a pollutant that sacrileg -\\nes the holiness of the temple, leaving it desolate. The desecration of the Jerusalem temple by \\nAntiochus IV Epiphanes during the Maccabean Revolt of 167–160 BC, wherein he erected an \\nimage of Zeus in the temple, is often linked to this prophecy in the book of Daniel (compare \\n1\\xa0Maccabees 1:54). Jesus uses this imagery from Daniel as a type for both the imminent deso -\\nlation of Jerusalem (and with it, Herod’s temple), as well as the desolating sacrileges preceding \\nHis Second Coming (Joseph Smith—Matthew 1:32). The disciples are admonished to stand in \\nholy places when they encounter such sacrilege. 1:13–17\\xa0 To escape the foretold calamities, \\nJesus warns His disciples to be prepared to flee at a moment’s notice. The instruction to flee \\ninto the mountains went against conventional ancient thinking, which prompted people \\nduring a siege or prolonged warfare to secure themselves in walled cities (such as Jerusalem) \\nfor better protection. With this, Jesus warns that the disciples will not find safety in manmade \\nartifices. Those with vulnerable family members such as children will find their situation ex -\\nacerbated since hunger and famine frequently follow disruptive events like those described \\nhere. Likewise, those forced to flee during the rainy winter, when travel is difficult, or the \\nsabbath, when travel is forbidden, will likewise be at a great disadvantage. 1:18–20\\xa0 The tribu -\\nlations of the Jews following the disastrous outcome of the Jewish Revolt are described in', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 111}),\n",

This early catalyst for the Latter-day Saints’ historical enterprise result -\\ned in the composition and publication of several histories of varying intent \\nand scope during the Prophet Joseph Smith’s lifetime. Each of these histories \\n(including the Prophet’s unpublished 1832 personal history and the published \\n1842 “Church History” editorial) preserve important reports of Joseph’s ad -\\nolescence, the inaugural events of the Restoration, and the early years of the \\nChurch. But it is the history begun in the spring of 1838 and resumed in the \\nsummer of 1839 that has arguably had the most significant impact on the \\nhistorical consciousness of the Latter-day Saints. This history, often referred \\nto simply as the 1838 history and presented to the world as the “History of \\nJoseph Smith, ” stands out among the Prophet’s other projects to chronicle his \\nlife if for no other reason than it is the only such project to enjoy canonical \\nstatus within the Church. \\nThe 1838 history was begun in late April of that same year after Joseph \\nSmith and the main body of the Saints had relocated from Kirtland, Ohio, \\nto Far West, Missouri. As recorded in an April 27, 1838, journal entry, the \\nProphet on that day began “writing a history of this Church\\xa0from the earliest \\nperiod\\xa0of its existence” with the assistance of Sidney Rigdon and George\\xa0W . \\nRobinson acting as scribe. Unfortunately, there are no known extant manu -\\nscripts of this initial undertaking. The earliest surviving manuscript copies of \\nthe 1838 history are two drafts composed by scribe James Mulholland, who \\nbegan work as one of Joseph’s clerks in September 1838.

After Mulholland’s death in November 1839, \\nsupervision of the history fell into the hands of clerks including Robert B. \\nThompson, William W . Phelps, and Willard Richards, who continued to com -\\npose material and make revisions to the history during the Prophet’s lifetime.  \\nThe 1838 history first appeared in print in the spring of 1842. The first \\nportion of the history appeared in the March 15, 1842, issue of the Times \\nand Seasons , the same issue that saw, among other things, the publication \\nof the second installment of the book of Abraham (Abraham 2:19–5:21 and \\nFacsimile 2). The history would continue to be published serially in the Times \\nand Seasons  until the Saints’ exodus from Illinois in 1846, and by the time \\nof the Prophet’s death on June 27, 1844, the Times and Seasons  had reached \\nDecember 1831 in the history’s narrative. Upon their settlement in Utah, the \\nSaints resumed publishing the history from 1851–1858 in serial installments \\nin the Deseret News .\\nMeanwhile, across the Atlantic in Great Britain, the Church’s newspaper \\nThe Latter Day Saints’ Millennial Star  had begun republishing the “History of \\nJoseph Smith” as early as June 1842, initially under the editorship of Apostle \\nParley\\xa0 P . Pratt. This series (a reprinting of the Times and Seasons ’ install -\\nments) would run until 1845 and then pick up again between 1852–1863 by \\nreprinting the Deseret News ’ run of the series. This web of publications and \\nrepublications would eventually be stabilized in B.\\xa0H.

Still, until such a time when, if ever, any of these other histories are \\naccepted into the canon, Joseph Smith’s 1838 history will remain the preem -\\ninent retelling of his early life and prophetic calling. \\nStructure\\nAs would be expected, Joseph Smith—History is told in the Prophet’s auto -\\nbiographical voice. It is entirely a prose narrative that is recounted, with the \\nexception of one small portion (Joseph Smith—History 1:64–65), from the \\nProphet’s own perspective. Although it seeks to “put all inquirers after truth \\nin possession of the facts” (1:1), the history is far from a neutral, dispassionate \\nchronicling of the events it describes. The composition of the history began \\nbetween the bitter apostasies of Kirtland in 1837 and the mounting tensions \\nin Missouri that would explode in late 1838 as the Missouri Mormon War. It \\nwas in this hostile, polemical environment that the Prophet opens his history \\nby decrying the “reports which have been put in circulation by evil-disposed \\nand designing persons” who wished “to militate against its character as a \\nChurch and its progress in the world. ” Indeed, feeling “induced” to go on \\nthe record, the Prophet’s stated intention with the history was to “disabuse \\nthe public mind” that was being excited against the Latter-day Saints with \\nscurrilous claims coming from a less-than-sympathetic national press. This \\nundoubtedly accounts for the defiant tone that runs throughout the history, \\nthe negative portrayal of those who opposed Joseph (whose actions are rou -\\ntinely described as “persecution” and “mobbing”), and the sense of persecu -\\ntion young Joseph felt in response to his visionary experiences that frames \\nthe opening and closing verses of the canonical text (1:21–26, 61, 74–75).\\nThe canonical 1838 history draws partially from extant records, which \\nit embeds into the narrative. This is seen most clearly with the retelling of \\nMartin Harris’s February 1828 visit with Charles Anthon and other schol -\\nars, which quotes verbatim an otherwise unattested account from Harris (see \\n1:64–65). The manuscript version of the history and the early publications of \\nthe same also embedded revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants as they \\nwere received at key points in the unfolding early events of the Restoration, \\nbut these were removed by Franklin\\xa0D.

This can \\nbe detected in how the Prophet sometimes uses qualifiers or approximations \\n(for example, “I was in my tenth year, or thereabouts . . . , ” “sometime in \\nthe second year after our removal to Manchester . . . , ” “a little over four -\\nteen years of age . . . , ” “sometime in this month of February . . . , ” “in due \\ntime [it would] be conferred on us . . . ”) when giving some dates and details, \\nwhile at other times providing details that are firm and concrete (see Joseph \\nSmith—History 1:27, 59, 68, 72). This should come as no surprise since some \\nof the events the Prophet recounts occurred when he was a young boy and a \\nteenager nearly two decades earlier. It should also come as no surprise that \\nthe events of 1837–1838 may well have influenced his memory and how he \\nretold his story, including, as mentioned above, the extreme sense of perse -\\ncution Joseph remembers feeling as a young man that is not as pronounced \\nin other histories. Rather than being signs of intentional misrepresentation \\nor deceit, however, these features give the history a marked sense of authen -\\nticity and sincerity. \\nSignificance for Latter-day Saints\\nAfter its canonization with the rest of the Pearl of Great Price on October \\n10, 1880, the impact (and importance) of the 1838 history on the Latter-day \\nSaints’ historical identity grew significantly. Now the Saints had an accessible \\naccount of the founding events of their religion that carried with it canonical \\nweight and authority. Sensing its importance, generations of Saints after the \\nhistory’s canonization have endeavored to reproduce, retell, and disseminate \\nits content and message as widely as possible. From the late nineteenth cen -\\ntury and into the twenty-first, a veritable avalanche of missionary tracts and \\npamphlets; articles; books; Sunday School, priesthood quorum, and Relief \\nSociety curricula; videos; music; and other media reproduced, retold, and \\nrepurposed the canonical text of the 1838 history as the defining institutional \\nand cultural narrative of Joseph Smith’s earliest visionary experiences.\\nBesides serving as the Church’s flagship story of its earliest years, Joseph \\nSmith’s 1838 history has also served as a deep theological wellspring from \\nwhich Latter-day Saints draw out significant doctrinal truths. For example, \\nfrom the Prophet’s account of his First Vision (1:14–20) members of the \\nChurch have extrapolated important points that touch on the nature of the \\nGodhead (that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, are two separate, \\nembodied personages) and the reality of modern revelation. Far from treat -\\ning it as nothing but a dry historical report, the Saints have largely treated the \\ncanonical version of Joseph’s 1838 history as a sacred repository that can be \\nused to formulate lasting theological paradigms. \\nBut perhaps the most pronounced effect the 1838 history has had on the \\nlives and faith of individual Latter-day Saints can be seen in how so many', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 119}),\n",

Revivalism in Western  \\nNew York\\n5\\xa0Some time in the second year after \\nour removal to Manchester, there \\nwas in the place where we lived an \\nunusual excitement on the subject \\nof religion. It commenced with the \\nMethodists, but soon became general \\namong all the sects in that region of \\ncountry. Indeed, the whole district \\nof country seemed affected by it, \\nand great multitudes united them -\\nselves to the different religious par -\\nties, which created no small stir and \\ndivision amongst the people, some \\ncrying, “Lo, here!” and others, “Lo, \\nthere!” Some were contending for the \\nMethodist faith, some for the Presby -\\nreaders to this content, but it appeared too late for the T&S  and MS printings of the history, \\nand consequently the 1851 edition of the Pearl of Great Price. Another addendum here in the \\nmanuscript provides the birth information and paternal genealogy of Joseph Sr. (see also the \\ncommentary at Joseph Smith—History 1:20, 27–28). 1:4\\xa0The Year of Alvin Smith’s Death . In the \\nmanuscript the date of Alvin’s death is provided as November 19, 1823, in an interlinear inser -\\ntion by Willard Richards. This is the date found on Alvin’s tombstone, which is still standing \\nin the Palmyra, New Y ork, cemetery. In the published version of the history in both the T&S  \\nand the MS as well as in the 1851 edition of the Pearl of Great Price, the date is not provided. \\nIn a history prepared between 1834 and 1836, Joseph mistakenly gave the date of Alvin’s death \\nas November 19, 1825. The 1902 edition of the Pearl of Great Price prepared by James\\xa0E. Tal -\\nmage also incorrectly gave the date as November 19, 1824, an error that was perpetuated until \\nthe 1981 edition. The move to Palmyra, New York . Joseph Sr. moved to Palmyra, New Y ork, in \\nthe summer of 1816. Lucy and the children, including Joseph Jr., left for New Y ork to meet \\nJoseph Sr. later that winter. Before moving to Palmyra, Joseph Sr. and Lucy had lived in multi -\\nple towns in Vermont and New Hampshire (including Tunbridge, Vermont; Randolph, Ver -\\nmont; Royalton, Vermont; Sharon, Vermont; Lebanon, New Hampshire; and Norwich, Ver -\\nmont). The move to Manchester, New York . Manchester Township lies just a few miles south of \\nthe Palmyra village to which the Smith family relocated between 1816 and 1817. During the \\nwinter of 1818–1819 the family moved into a log home that was adjacent to forested land in \\nManchester. Although the forested land was in Manchester Township, the cabin itself was still \\nin Palmyra Township (but not the village). 1:5\\xa0The timing of the First Vision . Here the Prophet \\nplaces the timing of the events leading to the First Vision as beginning “some time in the sec -\\nond year after our removal to Manchester, ” meaning 1819–1820. In a previous history (JS1832) \\nhe specified that he became “seriously impressed” with religious matters and the welfare of his \\nsoul “at about the age of twelve years, ” meaning in 1818. Harmonizing the accounts indicates \\nthat the events leading up to the First Vision (Joseph’s personal quest for salvation, his concern \\nover the contention he saw between religious denominations and local revivalism) took place', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 124}),\n",

In \\nprocess of time my mind became \\nsomewhat partial to the Methodist \\nbetween the years 1818 and 1820.  Revivals in the Palmyra, New York, area . Historians have \\ndocumented religious revivals and camp meetings occurring in the “region of country” or “the \\nwhole district of country” near Palmyra (or western New Y ork more generally) beginning in \\n1818. Although the 1838 history seems to place this activity principally in 1820, it does not \\nconfine it to only Palmyra. In light of Joseph’s other histories (primarily JS1832), a broader \\nchronological perspective should be kept in mind. Methodism, Presbyterianism, and Baptists . \\nIn addition to these three branches of Protestantism, the early United States was home to \\nCongregationalists, Quakers, Shakers, Episcopalians, Universalists, and other groups in a di -\\nverse religious cultural landscape. Joseph, by his own account, favored Methodism (1:8) but \\ndid not join the movement, while his mother, Hyrum, Samuel, and Sophronia joined the Pres -\\nbyterians (1:7). Joseph Sr. was attracted to Universalism and was otherwise religiously unaffil -\\niated, as were Joseph’s brothers Alvin and William. 1:7\\xa0Joseph’s age at the time of the First Vi -\\nsion is given here as occurring in his “fifteenth year” (meaning when he was fourteen years \\nold). Elsewhere in this account, Joseph gives his age as “between fourteen and fifteen years of \\nage” (1:22) and “a little over fourteen years of age” (1:23) at the time of the event. In other \\nhistories Joseph gave his age as “in the 16th year of my age” (JS1832), “about 14 years old” \\n(JS1835), and “about fourteen years of age” (JS1842). The age given in the 1838 history is con -\\nsistent with the 1835 and 1842 histories and with contemporary secondhand accounts \\n(OP1840, OH1842, DNW1843). Joseph’s age in the 1832 history was inserted interlineally by \\nscribe Frederick\\xa0G.

But so great were the \\nconfusion and strife among the dif -\\nferent denominations, that it was im -\\npossible for a person young as I was, \\nand so unacquainted with men and \\nthings, to come to any certain con -\\nclusion who was right and who was \\nwrong. 9\\xa0My mind at times was great -\\nly excited, the cry and tumult were \\nso great and incessant. The Presbyte -\\nrians were most decided against the \\nBaptists and Methodists, and used \\nall the powers of both reason and \\nsophistry to prove their errors, or, at \\nleast, to make the people think they \\nwere in error. On the other hand, the \\nBaptists and Methodists in their turn \\nwere equally zealous in endeavoring \\nto establish their own tenets and dis -\\nprove all others. 10\\xa0In the midst of this \\nwar of words and tumult of opinions, \\nI often said to myself, “What is to be \\ndone? Who of all these parties are \\nright, or, are they all wrong together? \\nIf any one of them be right, which is \\nit, and how shall I know it?” Joseph Turns to the Bible\\n11\\xa0While I was laboring under the ex -\\ntreme difficulties caused by the con -\\ntests of these parties of religionists, \\nI was one day reading the Epistle of \\nJames, first chapter and fifth verse, \\nwhich reads, “If any of you lack wis -\\ndom, let him ask of God, that giveth \\nto all men liberally, and upbraideth \\nnot; and it shall be given him. ” 12\\xa0Nev-\\ner did any passage of scripture come \\nwith more power to the heart of man \\nthan this did at this time to mine. It \\nseemed to enter with great force into \\nevery feeling of my heart. I reflected \\non it again and again, knowing that \\nif any person needed wisdom from \\nGod, I did. For how to act I did not \\nknow, and unless I could get more \\nwisdom than I then had, I would \\nnever know. For the teachers of reli -\\ngion of the different sects understood \\nthe same passages of scripture so dif -\\nferently as to destroy all confidence \\nin settling the question by an appeal \\nto the Bible. 13\\xa0At length I came to the \\nconclusion that I must either remain \\nin darkness and confusion, or else I \\npoor arithmetic on the Prophet’s part. 1:11\\xa0 The first of many scriptural citations in the 1838 \\nhistory appears here. The language at 1:5 draws from Luke 17:21 (“Lo, here! Lo, there!”), but \\nthis is the first overt scriptural citation. James 1:5, however, was not the only biblical passage \\nthat Joseph drew inspiration from as he wrestled with which faith to join. His 1835 account \\n(JS1835) reports that Matthew 7:7 also prompted him to seek God in prayer. Additionally, the \\n1832 history (JS1832) recounts the influence of Hebrews 13:8 and Psalm 14:1 on young Jo -\\nseph’s thinking at the time. But as the Prophet indicates here, it was James 1:5 that had the \\nmost profound effect on him, as also mentioned in the other contemporary first- and second -\\nhand renditions of the First Vision. 1:13\\xa0 Joseph’s primary motivation to seek God in prayer in \\nthis account is to resolve his confusion over which denomination to join. In the 1832 history \\n(JS1832) the emphasis is on Joseph seeking forgiveness for his sins. These motives are not \\nmutually exclusive. Besides the obvious fact that one of the main reasons people join a partic -\\nular religious denomination over another is precisely to achieve a sense of salvation and an \\nassurance of eternal security, historians have pointed out how these two categories had con -\\nceptual overlap in conversion accounts (especially Methodist accounts) contemporary with', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 126}),\n",

I at length came to the deter -\\nmination to ask of God, concluding \\nthat if he gave wisdom to them that \\nlacked wisdom, and would give liber -\\nally, and not upbraid, I might venture.\\nThe First Vision\\n14\\xa0So, in accordance with this, my de -\\ntermination to ask of God, I retired \\nto the woods to make the attempt. It \\nwas on the morning of a beautiful, \\nclear day, early in the spring of eigh -\\nteen hundred and twenty. It was the \\nfirst time in my life that I had made \\nsuch an attempt, for amidst all my \\nanxieties I had never as yet made the \\nattempt to pray vocally. 15\\xa0After I had \\nretired to the place where I had pre -\\nviously designed to go, having looked \\naround me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up \\nthe desires of my heart to God. I had \\nscarcely done so, when immediate -\\nly I was seized upon by some pow -\\ner which entirely overcame me and \\nhad such an astonishing influence \\nover me as to bind my tongue so that \\nI could not speak. Thick darkness \\ngathered around me, and it seemed \\nto me for a time as if I were doomed \\nto sudden destruction. 16\\xa0But, exert -\\ning all my powers to call upon God \\nto deliver me out of the power of this \\nenemy which had seized upon me, \\nand at the very moment when I was \\nready to sink into despair and aban -\\ndon myself to destruction—not to an \\nimaginary ruin, but to the power of \\nsome actual being from the unseen \\nworld, who had such marvelous pow -\\ner as I had never before felt in any \\nthe Prophet. Both motivations could be true at the same time: confused and dismayed over the \\nreligious divisions of his day (and even in his own family, which was religiously split), Joseph \\nfelt insecure and unsure about his eternal standing before God and so sought wisdom about \\nwhich church to join precisely to find some assurance that he would achieve salvation.  \\n1:14–15\\xa0 Timing of the vision . In this history Joseph places the timing of the First Vision “early \\nin the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. ” This is the most precise any of the Prophet’s \\nfirsthand accounts get in timing the vision. Satan attempts to stop Joseph . The supernatural \\nopposition that attempted to prevent young Joseph from praying is also mentioned in the \\nProphet’s 1835 account (JS1835). In this account Joseph describes how his “tongue seemed to \\nbe swollen in [his] mouth” so that he was unable to speak, and he writes that he “heard a noise \\nbehind [him], like some person walking towards [him]. ” When he looked around he “saw no \\nperson or thing that was calculated to produce the noise of walking. ” The language and imag -\\nery of Joseph being surrounded by darkness and feeling doomed to destruction but rallying \\nhis strength to continue calling on God parallels the experience of Moses described at Moses \\n1:20. The secondhand account provided by Orson Hyde (OH1842) speaks of this “thick dark -\\nness” as a “dark cloud” and mentions the adversary filling Joseph’s mind “with doubts and .\\xa0.\\xa0. \\nall manner of inappropriate images. ” 1:16\\xa0 Each of Joseph’s firsthand accounts mentions a \\nbright, fiery light that the boy saw in the vision. In the 1832 history (JS1832) the Prophet de -\\nscribed seeing “a pillar of fire” but then crossed out “fire” and substituted it with the word \\n“light. ” The 1835 account (JS1835) mentions “a pillar of fire, ” or a “pillar of flame which was \\nspread all around and yet nothing consumed. ” And the 1842 Wentworth Letter (JS1842) \\nspeaks of “a brilliant light which eclipsed the sun at noon-day. ” Contemporary secondhand \\naccounts report the same thing: Orson Pratt (OP1840) described “a very bright and glorious', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 127}),\n",

One of \\nthem spake unto me, calling me by \\nname and said, pointing to the other, \\n“This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” \\n18\\xa0My object in going to inquire of the \\nLord was to know which of all the \\nsects was right, that I might know \\nwhich to join. No sooner, therefore, \\ndid I get possession of myself, so as to \\nbe able to speak, than I asked the Per -\\nsonages who stood above me in the \\nlight in the heavens above, ” and David Nye White (DNW1843) simply calls it “a light, ” while \\nAlexander Neibaur (AN1844) records “a fire towards heaven. ” 1:17\\xa0 Two Personages . With one \\nexception, each first- and secondhand account of the First Vision from the Prophet’s lifetime \\nexplicitly speaks of young Joseph seeing two heavenly personages. Some of these accounts \\n(JS1835; DNW1843; AN1844) describe one personage appearing before the other, and other \\naccounts (OP1840; OH1842; JS1842) describe the two personages as appearing exactly alike \\nin features and likeness. Although Joseph himself did not record a detailed description of the \\npersonages he saw, one secondhand account (AN1844) records that Joseph described the per -\\nsonage in the pillar of fire or light as having “light complexion [and] blue eyes” with “a piece \\nof white cloth drawn over his shoulders, his right arm bear. ” The exception mentioned above \\nis the 1832 history (JS1832), which does not overtly speak of two personages. It records, “The \\nLord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord. ” Scholars have proposed various ways \\nto reconcile the 1832 history with the later accounts. The most persuasive is that the title Lord, \\nused twice, is referring to God the Father in the first instance and then to the Son in the sec -\\nond. This would harmonize with the accounts that speak of one personage appearing before \\nthe other and that claim that the two personages looked exactly alike. “This is My Beloved Son. \\nHear Him!”  Two secondhand accounts (DNW1843, AN1844) report that this testimony was \\ngiven by the Father during the vision. The 1832 and 1835 accounts (JS1832, JS1835) might \\nallude to the Father’s testimony but are not explicit. These two accounts, as well as Orson \\nPratt’s (OP1842), mention that the Lord forgave Joseph’s sins. 1:18\\xa0 As noted above (see the \\ncommentary at 1:13), in this account the main question Joseph raises is which church he \\nshould join. This agrees with many of the other reports of the vision (JS1835; OP1840; \\nOH1842; JS1842; DNW1843; AN1844). In his earliest account (JS1832), the Prophet empha -\\nsized his personal search for salvation without explicitly couching this quest in the context of \\nwhat denomination he should join. Never entered into my heart . This phrase (“for at this time \\nit had never entered into my heart that all were wrong”) was, for reasons unknown, omitted in \\nthe 1902 edition of the Pearl of Great Price and was not restored until the 1981 edition. It is \\npresent in the manuscript version of this history, in the T&S  and MS printings, and in the first \\ntwo editions of the Pearl of Great Price (1851 and 1878). In another draft of the 1838 history \\nthe parenthetical comment reads, “For I supposed that one of them were so, ” which suggests \\nsome amount of ambivalence was still in Joseph’s mind at the time of the vision.

I replied, “Never mind, all is \\nwell—I am well enough off. ” I then \\nsaid to my mother, “I have learned \\nfor myself that Presbyterianism is not \\n[was] built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament. ” Scholars have \\nproposed various ways to read these accounts in harmony and stress that minor variations \\nsuch as these do not suggest calculating attempts to fabricate a story. 1:19\\xa0 They were all wrong . \\nHere and in the next verse Joseph is informed by the Lord that the churches of his day were in \\napostasy and that he should join none of them. This point is captured in all the extant accounts \\nof the vision from the Prophet’s lifetime except one (JS1835). Joseph’s choice to report the \\nLord’s rather blunt and sweeping condemnations in this account (for example, “they were all \\nwrong . . . , ” “all their creeds were an abomination . . . , ” “those professors were all corrupt . . . ”) \\nmay be at least partially in response to the recent opposition and hostility in Kirtland and \\nMissouri that were fresh on the Prophet’s mind (see also the discussion in the commentary at \\nJoseph Smith—History 1:1, 22–23). Another one of Joseph’s firsthand accounts (JS1842) uses \\nmuch softer language than is used in this verse. It should also be kept in mind that this is Jo -\\nseph’s paraphrasing of what the Lord told him, not necessarily a direct quotation, so it is un -\\ncertain how much of the language is specifically from the Lord and how much was shaped by \\nJoseph himself. They draw near  .\\xa0.\\xa0. the power thereof . Quotations or paraphrases of Isaiah \\n29:13 and 2\\xa0Timothy 3:5. According to two accounts (JS1832 and AN1844) the Lord also drew \\nfrom the language of Psalm 14:3 (“there is none that doeth good, no, not one”). The totalizing \\nlanguage in Psalm 14:3 is congruent with the Lord’s sweeping condemnations in Joseph \\nSmith—History 1:19. 1:20\\xa0 Joseph indicates that he deliberately left out some of the Lord’s \\nwords to him in the vision. We are left to speculate on exactly what else the Lord may have told \\nhim, but from details in the other extant accounts of the vision, it most likely included matters \\nrelated to the apostasy, the forthcoming restoration of the gospel, and Joseph’s personal stand -\\ning before God. In the 1835 account (JS1835) the Prophet indicates that he saw “many angels” \\nin the vision. The number and identity of these angels and whether they too related anything \\nto Joseph in the vision is unknown. Joseph also fails to describe how long the vision lasted. \\nSince he was told “many other things” during the vision that are not recorded and since, as he \\nsays next, when he came to himself he was lying on his back and physically exhausted (see also \\nDWN1843), it might be supposed that the vision lasted some time.

I have \\nthought since, that I felt much like \\nPaul, when he made his defense be -\\nfore King Agrippa, and related the \\naccount of the vision he had when he \\nsaw a light, and heard a voice, but still \\nthere were but few who believed him. \\nSome said he was dishonest, others \\nsaid he was mad, and he was ridi -\\nculed and reviled. But all this did not \\ndestroy the reality of his vision. He \\nhad seen a vision, he knew he had, \\nand all the persecution under heav -\\nen could not make it otherwise. And \\nthough they should persecute him \\nunto death, yet he knew, and would \\nknow to his latest breath, that he had \\nboth seen a light and heard a voice \\nspeaking unto him, and all the world \\ncould not make him think or believe otherwise. \\n25\\xa0So it was with me. I had actu -\\nally seen a light, and in the midst of \\nthat light I saw two Personages, and \\nthey did in reality speak to me, and \\nthough I was hated and persecuted \\nfor saying that I had seen a vision, \\nyet it was true. And while they were \\npersecuting me, reviling me, and \\nspeaking all manner of evil against \\nme falsely for so saying, I was led to \\nsay in my heart, “Why persecute me \\nfor telling the truth?” I have actual -\\nly seen a vision, and who am I that I \\ncan withstand God, or why does the \\nworld think to make me deny what \\nI have actually seen? For I had seen \\na vision. I knew it, and I knew that \\nGod knew it, and I could not deny it, \\nneither dared I do it. At least I knew \\nthat by so doing I would offend God \\nand come under condemnation. 26\\xa0I \\nhad now got my mind satisfied so \\nfar as the sectarian world was con -\\ncerned—that it was not my duty to \\njoin with any of them, but to contin -\\nue as I was until further directed. I \\nhad found the testimony of James to \\nbe true—that a man who lacked wis -\\ndom might ask of God, and obtain, \\nand not be upbraided.\\ngree and severity of this opposition, as well as the language he chose to describe it, was influ -\\nenced by the recent persecutions of Kirtland and Missouri. 1:24–26\\xa0 Joseph compares himself to \\nthe Apostle Paul .

Joseph uses the bold defense Paul offered before Herod Agrippa \\nII as a comparable example to his own feelings and experience as he affirmed the reality of his \\nvision before a skeptical public. Joseph’s biblical-minded audience would have immediately \\nunderstood the significance of this comparison. What Joseph learned from the vision . Lat-\\nter-day Saints today have extrapolated several important truths from the First Vision, includ -\\ning points that touch on the nature of the Godhead and the reality of modern revelation.

He first quoted \\npart of the third chapter of Malachi; \\nbringing forth and translating the record will occupy the next thirty-four verses. As with the \\nFirst Vision, the Prophet gave multiple accounts of the coming forth and translation of the \\nBook of Mormon. Many of these accounts, in fact, were retold right alongside his other rendi -\\ntions of the First Vision (see JS1832; JS1835; JS1842). Clearly in Joseph’s mind the two events \\nwere linked and were considered foundational to his prophetic calling. Written upon gold \\nplates . Joseph and other witnesses to the plates, or those who otherwise handled them in some \\ncapacity, described them as being gold or having “the appearance of gold”; weighing between \\nforty to sixty pounds; measuring about six or seven inches wide, eight inches long, and four to \\nsix inches thick; having individual plates as thick as “common tin” or parchment; having a \\nportion sealed; having three D-shaped rings binding the plates; and being “engraved” on both \\nsides with “characters” or “hieroglyphics. ” An account of the former inhabitants of this conti -\\nnent . Although on occasion the Prophet appealed to artifacts from both North and Central \\nAmerica as evidence for the antiquity of the Book of Mormon, he never gave a detailed de -\\nscription of the geography or of the ancient setting of the events recorded in the text. During \\nthe Prophet’s lifetime, readers of the book began formulating geography theories to situate the \\ntext in a real-world setting, but none of these nor any subsequent theories have ever arisen to \\nthe level of revealed authority for the Church as a whole. In her memoirs (LMS1844), Joseph’s \\nmother, Lucy Mack Smith, related how Moroni instructed young Joseph about the ancient \\ninhabitants of America as the boy prepared for the recovery and translation of the record, a \\ndetail the Prophet also reported in another history (JS1842). 1:35\\xa0 Joseph’s use of the term \\n“Urim and Thummim” to describe the instrument he recovered with the plates (compare \\nJS1835) likely takes its lead from early Church leaders W .\\xa0 W . Phelps and Oliver Cowdery \\n(OC1834, including the excerpted passage below), who both had previously drawn a connec -\\ntion between the biblical oracular device and the Nephite “interpreters” (see Exodus 28:30; \\nNumbers 27:21; Mosiah 8:13; 28:11, 13) in Church publications. In his earliest account of the \\ncoming forth of the Book of Mormon (JS1832), the Prophet described this instrument as a set \\nof “spectacles” that had been prepared to translate the book without giving it the name Urim \\nand Thummim. Besides attesting to the use of the Nephite interpreters that were deposited \\nwith the plates, eyewitnesses to the translation of the Book of Mormon also described Joseph \\nplacing another seer stone in his possession in the bottom of a hat, drawing the brim of the hat \\nover his face to block out external light, and then reading off the translated words as they ap -\\npeared in the stone. It is unclear precisely when in the course of translation the Prophet used \\nthe Nephite interpreters and when he used his personal seer stone.

He had heard \\nsomething of a silver mine having \\nbeen opened by the Spaniards in \\nHarmony, Susquehanna county, State \\nof Pennsylvania, and had, previous to \\nmy hiring to him, been digging in or -\\nder, if possible, to discover the mine. \\nAfter I went to live with him, he \\ntook me, with the rest of his hands, to \\ndig for the silver mine, at which I con -\\ntinued to work for nearly a month, \\nwithout success in our undertaking, \\nand finally I prevailed with the old \\ngentleman to cease digging after it. \\nHence arose the very prevalent story \\nof my having been a money-digger. \\n57\\xa0During the time that I was thus \\nemployed, I was put to board with a \\nMr.\\xa0 Isaac Hale, of that place. It was \\nthere I first saw my wife (his daugh -\\nter), Emma Hale. On the 18th of Jan -\\nuary, 1827, we were married, while \\nI was yet employed in the service of \\nMr.\\xa0 Stoal. 58\\xa0Owing to my continu -\\ning to assert that I had seen a vision, \\npersecution still followed me, and \\nmy wife’s father’s family were very \\nmuch opposed to our being married. \\nI was, therefore, under the necessity \\nof taking her elsewhere. So we went \\nand were married at the house of Squire Tarbill, in South Bainbridge, \\nChenango county, New Y ork. Im -\\nmediately after my marriage, I left  \\nMr.\\xa0 Stoal’s, and went to my father’s, \\nand farmed with him that season.\\nJoseph Obtains the Plates\\n59\\xa0At length the time arrived for ob -\\ntaining the plates, the Urim and \\nThummim, and the breastplate. On \\nthe twenty-second day of Septem -\\nber, one thousand eight hundred and \\ntwenty-seven, having gone as usu -\\nal at the end of another year to the \\nplace where they were deposited, the \\nsame heavenly messenger delivered \\nthem up to me with this charge: that \\nI should be responsible for them, that \\nif I should let them go carelessly, or \\nthrough any neglect of mine, I should \\nbe cut off, but that if I would use all \\nmy endeavors to preserve them, un -\\ntil he, the messenger, should call for \\nthem, they should be protected. 60\\xa0I \\nsoon found out the reason why I \\nhad received such strict charges to \\nkeep them safe, and why it was that \\nthe messenger had said that when I \\nhad done what was required at my \\nhand, he would call for them. For no \\nsooner was it known that I had them, \\nthan the most strenuous exertions \\nwere used to get them from me.

He was deeply skeptical of his son-in-\\nlaw’s claims to having seen visions (as mentioned here and confirmed by other sources), which \\nled to increased tensions between the two and likely influenced Joseph’s memory of having felt \\npersecuted during this time. 1:59–60\\xa0 Reminiscences from sources both hostile and friendly \\ntoward Joseph confirm that some local Palmyra residents took his claims to having golden', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 139}),\n",

They lived at \\nfirst with Emma’s parents but shortly thereafter moved into their own small home near her \\nparents’ house. 1:63\\xa0 According to Joseph’s 1832 history (JS1832) the decision to send Martin \\nto New Y ork with a copy of the characters from the Book of Mormon plates came at the \\nprompting of a revelation. Some sources (including LMS1844) indicate that Joseph was at first \\nunsure precisely how to accomplish the translation, and so the decision to consult with schol -\\nars arose, in part, to help get some initial assistance or bearings therewith.

Professor Anthon \\nstated that the translation was cor -\\nrect, more so than any he had before \\nseen translated from the Egyptian. I \\nthen showed him those which were \\nnot yet translated, and he said that \\nthey were Egyptian, Chaldaic, As -\\nsyriac, and Arabic, and he said they \\nwere true characters. He gave me a \\ncertificate, certifying to the people of \\nPalmyra that they were true charac -\\nters, and that the translation of such of them as had been translated was \\nalso correct. I took the certificate \\nand put it into my pocket, and was \\njust leaving the house, when Mr.\\xa0An -\\nthon called me back, and asked me \\nhow the young man found out that \\nthere were gold plates in the place \\nwhere he found them. I answered \\nthat an angel of God had revealed it \\nunto him. 65\\xa0He then said to me, ‘Let \\nme see that certificate. ’ I accordingly \\ntook it out of my pocket and gave it \\nto him, when he took it and tore it to \\npieces, saying that there was no such \\nthing now as ministering of angels, \\nand that if I would bring the plates \\nto him he would translate them. I \\ninformed him that part of the plates \\nwere sealed, and that I was forbidden \\nto bring them. He replied, ‘I cannot \\nread a sealed book. ’ I left him and \\nwent to Dr.\\xa0Mitchell, who sanctioned \\nwhat Professor Anthon had said re -\\nspecting both the characters and the \\ntranslation. ”\\nmencement of the composition of this history in the spring of 1838). 1:64–65\\xa0 Besides Charles \\nAnthon, Harris also visited with and consulted the linguist and diplomat Luther Bradish \\n(1783–1863) and the scholar Samuel Mitchell (1764–1831) respecting the characters. The de -\\ntails and outcome of Harris’s visit with Bradish are unknown. Historical sources do not make \\nit clear whether Harris visited Mitchell before or after Anthon. By his account, Harris makes it \\nsound as though he visited Anthon and then Mitchell (1:65), but other sources reverse the \\norder. In either case, these are the three known contacts Harris made as he consulted with \\nscholars. Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyriac, and Arabic . At the time of the composition of this re -\\nport “Chaldaic” or “Chaldean” was used to designate Aramaic, and “ Assyriac” to designate \\ncuneiform (that is, the script of ancient Assyria). Anthon’s account of the meeting . Anthon left  \\nthree known accounts describing this encounter. In each of them, he indicates that he ex -\\npressed skepticism that the characters were authentic and claimed that he warned Harris that \\nhe was being conned. Anthon’s own version of this episode thus differs dramatically from \\nHarris’s. Anthon’s accounts are not entirely free from problems, however, because he contra -\\ndicts himself in some key details. Whatever exactly was said in their meeting, Harris left con -\\nvinced Joseph had an ancient record in his possession and was a lifelong supporter of the Book \\nof Mormon. ‘I cannot read a sealed book. ’  Paraphrase of Isaiah 29:11.

Martin Harris’s con -\\nsultation with scholars occurred in February 1828.

An account of the loss of the \\n116 pages had previously been recorded in Joseph’s 1832 history (JS1832), and in fact, the \\nmanuscript version of this history as well as the T&S  and MS publications contain an account \\nof the loss of the 116 pages and reproduce the revelations that are now sections 3, 4, 5, and 10 \\nof the Doctrine and Covenants. For reasons unknown (maybe to conserve space) Franklin\\xa0D. \\nRichards opted to drop this content from the 1851 Pearl of Great Price. Oliver Cowdery . Oliver \\nCowdery (1806–1850) served as the principal scribe in the translation of the Book of Mormon \\nfrom April 1829 to its completion in mid- or late-June of that year. With some assistance, he \\nalso prepared a copy of the original manuscript of the book for publication. Besides being \\ninformed of Joseph’s divine calling by the Smith family (as mentioned in this verse), according \\nto Joseph’s 1832 history Oliver also had a vision of the plates and felt a confirming witness \\nfrom God that he should assist in the work (compare Doctrine and Covenants 6:22–23).

The restoration of the priesthood is men -\\ntioned briefly in Joseph’s 1832 history, which speaks of “the reception of the holy priesthood \\nby the ministering of angels. ” From this it seems that the 1832 history was going to give a \\nfuller account of the priesthood restoration, but unfortunately the text ends abruptly with Jo -\\nseph narrating his time in Harmony, Pennsylvania.

Titled “Church History” at the time of its first \\nappearance in print, this composition has been enshrined in Latter-day Saint \\nhistorical consciousness and vernacular as the Wentworth Letter after the \\nname of its immediate recipient. In fact, though, Wentworth had requested \\na statement from Joseph not for himself but for his friend, the Boston law -\\nyer George Barstow, who was then preparing a history of the state of New \\nHampshire. Sensing an opportune time to capitalize on the growing national \\ninterest in the Church, the Prophet composed this history with the express \\ndesire that it be published “ungarnished, and without misrepresentation” for \\nthe general reading public. \\nIn this history, Joseph narrated his early life; provided one of the few \\nfirsthand accounts of his First Vision, the appearance of Moroni, and the \\ncoming forth of the Book of Mormon; and retold the history of the Church \\nfrom its founding on April 6, 1830, to its rise and progress up to the point \\nof the history’s composition (with special emphasis on the persecution the \\nSaints had suffered in Missouri). After providing this history and extolling \\nthe growing missionary work of the Church, the Prophet concluded with \\nthirteen declarations of faith, twelve of which began with “We believe. ” It was \\nin this context that Joseph provided the first articulation of what are now \\nknown as the Articles of Faith.\\nThis was not, however, the first time Latter-day Saints had attempted to \\nprovide a synopsis of their beliefs in a way similar to the 1842 Articles of', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 147}),\n",

In 1834, Oliver Cowdery, then acting as editor of The Latter Day Saints’ \\nMessenger and Advocate , published a catalog of some of the Church’s foun -\\ndational doctrines that each began with the declaration “We believe. ” These \\npoints touched on the Saints’ belief in the Godhead, continuing revelation, \\nreligious liberty, and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. In 1840, Apostles \\n(and brothers) Parley and Orson Pratt both published their own formula -\\ntions of the essentials of Latter-day Saint doctrine. Orson Pratt’s tract A[n] \\nInteresting Account of Several Remarkable Visions , in which his version ap -\\npeared, was so influential, in fact, that Joseph himself appropriated some of \\nits language (sometimes verbatim) when composing “Church History” and \\nthe Articles of Faith.\\nThe Articles of Faith have been present in every major edition of the Pearl \\nof Great Price since the 1851 first edition. They were first left unnamed, only \\nbeing called “ Articles of our Faith” in the 1878 Salt Lake edition prepared by \\nOrson Pratt. The name they are known by today (“The Articles of Faith of \\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints”) was first given to them in \\nthe 1902 edition prepared by James\\xa0E. Talmage. Ironically, despite Joseph’s \\ndesire that the articles not be separated from the rest of the “Church History” \\neditorial, they have always appeared in the Pearl of Great Price separated \\nfrom the historical content in which the Prophet couched them, which has \\nnever enjoyed the same canonical status.\\nStructure\\nThe Articles of Faith are a succession of short, declarative statements of faith. \\nAlthough authored by Joseph Smith, they are made with first-person plu -\\nral pronouns, thereby signaling their significance for the Latter-day Saints \\nas a faith community. As mentioned, they were originally composed to be \\nthe culmination of a longer historical narrative, but as encountered by most \\nLatter-day Saints today they are isolated from this historical and narrative \\ncontext. Although they may appear random at first glance, the Articles of \\nFaith in fact can be classified into distinct, purposeful theological categories. \\nThe first and second articles elucidate the Latter-day Saint view of the nature \\nof God and humanity, thus satisfying what is arguably the most important \\nmetaphysical groundwork that must be laid in any discussion of theology. \\nThe third and fourth articles touch on soteriology, or the theology of salva -\\ntion. The fifth, sixth, and seventh articles overview the ecclesiastical struc -\\nture of the Church of Jesus Christ and the spiritual gifts that accompany the \\noffices of the Church. The eighth and ninth articles declare the nature of the \\ncanon and ongoing revelation.

For example, the third article affirms that \\nhumanity can only be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the \\ngospel of Jesus Christ, and the fourth article then expounds on what these \\nlaws and ordinances are. The fifth article clarifies that proper ordination to \\necclesiastical office comes by prophecy and the laying on of hands by one \\nin authority, then the sixth explains what those offices are, and the seventh \\nnames the spiritual gifts that operate in those offices. The eighth article af -\\nfirms the canonical authority of the scriptural record, while the ninth adds \\nto it by explaining that the canon remains open because revelation continues \\nin the Church of Jesus Christ. The articles’ progressive nature and logical or -\\ndering invites readers to ponder on their relationship to each other and their \\nsignificance within this broader schema.\\nJoseph Smith’s signature has appeared at the end of the Articles of Faith \\nsince they were first published in 1842 and in each edition of the Pearl of \\nGreat Price since 1851. This fulfills the practical need of identifying the au -\\nthor and reinforces their prophetic weight and authority.  \\nSignificance for Latter-day Saints\\nWhether the Nicene Creed of the fourth century AD or the Westminster \\nConfession of the seventeenth, Latter-day Saints are characteristically sus -\\npicious of the classical Christian creeds that, in their view, impose restric -\\ntive theological boundaries that stifle the unfolding process of revelation \\nand restoration. In a discourse delivered on October 15, 1843, Joseph Smith, \\ndrawing from the language of Job 38:11, voiced his frustration with creeds \\nthat “set up stakes and say ‘hitherto shalt thou come, and no further. ’” But \\nthe Articles of Faith, as some have pointed out, can arguably be viewed as a \\nset of de facto creeds for the Latter-day Saints. (The very word creed  comes \\nfrom the Latin credo , meaning “I believe. ”) This apparent paradox highlights \\nthe tension inherent between the efforts of Latter-day Saints beginning with \\nJoseph Smith to codify and systematize their theology on the one hand and \\nthe expansive, progressive nature of revelation in the Church of Jesus Christ \\non the other.\\nThe solution to this paradox would be, it seems, to view the Articles of \\nFaith not as strict demarcations of religious identity to which the faithful \\nmust strictly adhere but rather as an executive summary of just some of the \\nfundamental doctrines underpinning the Restoration. This, indeed, is how \\nJoseph Smith treated them in the context of his letter to John Wentworth and \\nis how Latter-day Saints have typically approached them. That the Articles \\nof Faith were likely not intended to function in the same way as the classical \\nChristian creeds can further be seen in what they leave out.

The existence of a loving \\nHeavenly Father who is personally concerned with the lives and salvation of His children \\nunderpins the Saints’ worldview and sense of purpose in life. Of equal importance to this \\nworldview and sense of purpose is the divine sonship of Jesus Christ, who performed an in -\\nfinite atonement to draw the Father’s children back into His presence, a point that is reiterated \\nin the third article. Finally, the Father’s means of communicating with His children and of \\nrevealing to them light and truth is accomplished through the Holy Ghost, who stands next \\nto the Father and the Son as the third member of the Godhead. Joseph Smith’s teachings on the \\nGodhead . In a discourse delivered sometime around May 1841, the Prophet taught that an “ev -\\nerlasting covenant was made between three personages before the organizations of the earth, \\nand relates to their dispensation of things to men on the earth. These personages, according \\nto Abraham’s record, are called God the First, the Creator; God the Second, the Redeemer; \\nand God the Third, the Witness or Testator. ” This detail is missing from the extant text of \\nthe book of Abraham (suggesting that the Prophet had translated or revealed more material \\nthan is presently published). In any case, it demonstrates the influence the Prophet’s scriptural \\ntranslations and revelations had on his theological thought as it developed line upon line. \\nOn June 15, 1844, in one of his last public discourses before his death, the Prophet told his \\naudience, “I have always declared God to be a distinct personage, Jesus Christ a separate and \\ndistinct personage from God the Father, and the Holy Ghost was a distinct personage and \\na Spirit; and that these three constitute three distinct personages and three Gods. ” Though \\nnot explicitly detailed in the first article of faith, this teaching and the Prophet’s revelations \\non God’s corporeality and humankind’s potential for divinization and exaltation (articulated \\nmost forcefully in the April 7, 1844, King Follet Sermon) are the most radical departures from \\nclassical Christian thought on the nature of God.\\n2 Latter-day Saints challenge the historical Christian teaching of original sin and what it theo -\\nlogically implies about the inherently sinful, depraved state of humanity. First formulated \\nby St. Augustine in the fourth century AD, the doctrine of original sin posits that humanity \\ninherited the consequences and, crucially, the culpability  of Adam’s sin on account of their \\ndescent from the first man. The full nature and scope of original sin has been debated among \\nChristian theologians since Augustine’s day. Latter-day Saints do not deny humanity’s need for \\nredemption, as articulated in the next article, nor the deleterious affects the Fall of Adam and \\nEve have had on humanity, but they do deny the total depravity and culpability of humanity \\nfor Adam and Eve’s transgression.

       " Document(page_content='144   |   The Articles of Faith\\n3We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be \\nsaved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.\\n4We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: \\nfirst, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism \\nby immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for \\nthe gift of the Holy Ghost.\\nthat “every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man from \\nthe fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God” (Doctrine and Cove -\\nnants 93:38).\\n3 Closely related to this belief in the Fall of Adam and Eve is Latter-day Saints’ belief in the \\nneed for a Savior to achieve an infinite atonement that will redeem humanity (compare 2\\xa0Ne -\\nphi 9:7). Without a Fall, there is no need for a Redemption. Soteriology, or the theology of \\nsalvation, concerns itself with attempting to understand and formulate how men and women \\nachieve salvation and overcome the effects of the Fall. The two crucial questions underlying \\nany discussion of soteriology are how salvation is achieved and who can achieve it. The first \\nquestion asks what the relationship is between faith, grace, and works, while the second asks \\nabout the scope of Christ’s Atonement regarding who it saves. Answers to these questions var -\\nied greatly in the Christian world of Joseph Smith’s day, with Calvinists and other Reformed \\nChristians on the one end teaching a limited atonement for only those God had predestined to \\nbe saved and Universalists on the other side teaching unconditional universal salvation for all \\nhumanity. Many Christians likewise disagreed over the proper role between faith and works \\nin salvation. Latter-day Saints reject the soteriological extremes of Reformed Protestantism on \\nthe one hand and Universalism on the other and insist that all men and women may be saved \\n(thus denying limited atonement) while also affirming that it can only be achieved through \\nobedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel (thus denying unconditional salvation).\\n4 The fourth article develops the third by clarifying the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ \\nto which men and women must be obedient to be saved. This is clearer in the T&S  rendition \\nof the first line of this article, which reads, “We believe these ordinances are .\\xa0.\\xa0. , ” with the \\nantecedent to “these ordinances” being “the laws and ordinances of the Gospel” of the third \\narticle. This reading was retained until the 1902 edition of the Pearl of Great Price, where it \\nwas changed to its current reading on the recommendation of James\\xa0E. Talmage. The primary \\ndefinition of ordinance  in Joseph Smith’s day was “a rule established by authority; a permanent \\nrule of action” (Noah Webster’s 1828 dictionary). In this regard, faith and repentance can \\nindeed be seen as ordinances as well as principles of the gospel. Additional principles of the \\ngospel . In a discourse delivered between June 26 and July 2, 1839, Joseph Smith indicated that \\n“the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgement are necessary to preach \\namong the first principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. ”', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 153}),\n",

The Latter-day Saint emphasis on \\npriesthood ordination to qualify those who administer the ordinances of the gospel diverges \\nfrom historical and contemporary Protestantism and aligns itself more closely with Catholic \\nand Orthodox understanding.\\n6 Just as the fourth article builds on the third, so the sixth builds on the fifth by enumerating \\nthe offices that comprise the ecclesiastical structure of the Church of Jesus Christ. The fifth \\narticle describes how an individual attains an office in the Church, while the sixth lists what \\nsome of those offices are. The primitive church . Here the adjective “primitive” should not be \\ntaken to mean “simple or unsophisticated” but rather “earlier, ancient, or primeval. ” The prim -\\nitive church refers to the church established by Jesus during His mortal ministry. The five offic -\\nes listed by the Prophet are attested in the New Testament as having been operative during the \\nfirst century church, and indeed, the language of this article appears to be following Ephesians \\n4:11. Although Joseph Smith taught that the offices of the modern Church of Jesus Christ rep -\\nresent a restoration of those offices in the primitive church of the first century, it should not be \\nassumed that the organizational structure of the Church today represents a static, one-for-one \\ncarbon copy or replica of the apostolic church. \\n7 Along with the restoration of the offices of the primitive church comes the restoration of its \\ngifts and powers.

In the Wentworth Letter the \\nProphet emphasized that the Book of Mormon was to “be united with the Bible for the ac -\\ncomplishment of the purposes of God in the last days. ” Although not mentioned in this article, \\nthe Doctrine and Covenants as a book of living scripture—a book of current, ongoing reve -\\nlation—is implicitly assumed in the next article. By naming the Book of Mormon alongside \\nthe Bible as the word of God, Joseph affirmed that the canon of scripture was open and that \\nhe was in a position by virtue of his own prophetic office to produce new scripture. As far as it \\nis translated correctly . This article rejects the Protestant doctrine of sola scriptura , or the belief \\nthat scripture alone is sufficient for establishing doctrine and authority in the church. One of \\nthe truths the Prophet learned through his revelations and work on the “new translation” or \\nrevision of the Bible from 1830 to 1833 is that the Bible is on its own insufficient and suffered \\nfrom errors of translation, transmission, and interpretation (all three of these concepts are \\nassumed under the Prophet’s use of the word “translation” in this article). As Joseph taught in \\nan October 15, 1843, discourse, “I believe the Bible as it ought to be, as it came from the pen \\nof the original writers. ”\\n9 Once again, as with articles four and three and six and five, this article builds on the one \\nthat immediately precedes it by confirming that with an open canon of scripture comes also \\ncontinuing revelation. This principle is foundational to the faith of the Latter-day Saints, who \\nuphold that God continues to reveal light and truth pertaining to the operation of His king -\\ndom and the things of eternity. The canonical book of Doctrine and Covenants serves as the \\nscriptural repository of the revelations of Joseph Smith and his prophetic successors.\\n10 The tenth article briefly encapsulates the Latter-day Saints’ eschatology, or the theology of \\nthe ultimate destiny of humanity, the end times, the Millennium, and Final Judgment. The \\ncomponents that constitute Joseph Smith’s eschatology as defined in this article are scattered \\nthroughout Restoration scripture and are the literal gathering of Israel (3 Nephi 20–22; Doc -\\ntrine and Covenants 110:11), the building up of Zion (Doctrine and Covenants 6:6; 11:6; \\n12:6; 14:6: 45:66–67; 57:1–3), Christ’s return to rule on earth (Doctrine and Covenants 29:11;', metadata={'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf', 'page': 155}),\n",

The urgency they \\nhave attached this universal right originates, in part, from their own history of persecution \\nbecause of their faith.

Doctrine and Covenants 134:5–8 outlines \\nthe Saints’ belief on this point. However, historically there have been times when the Saints \\nhave practiced civil disobedience when they felt laws were unjustly encroaching on their \\nrights.

      "[Document(page_content='Introduction   |   i \\nIntroduction\\nOn July 15, 1851, Elder Franklin D. Richards of the Quorum of the Twelve \\nApostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints published a short \\nnotice in the Church’s European newspaper, The Latter-day Saints’ Millennial \\nStar, announcing the publication of “a new work which will soon be ready for \\nsale. ” This work was expected to be “a source of much instruction and edifi -\\ncation to many thousands of the Saints. ” The name Elder Richards gave this \\nnew volume was the Pearl of Great Price, taking his inspiration from Jesus’s \\nparable in Matthew 13:45–46. \\nWriting from Liverpool, England, Elder Richards informed readers in \\nthe preface to the first edition of the Pearl of Great Price that he felt the vol -\\nume was necessary because of “repeated solicitations of several friends of \\nthe publisher, who are desirous to be put in possession of the very import -\\nant articles contained therein. ” By compiling this collection of “revelations, \\ntranslations, and narrations” of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Elder Richards \\nhoped that members of the Church would “increase their ability to maintain \\nand to defend the holy faith” by becoming better informed of the “precious \\ntruths” revealed by the Prophet. “It would, ” he assured, “commend itself to all \\ncareful students of the scriptures. ” The content selected by Elder Richards for \\nthis new compendium included:\\n• Extracts from the book of Genesis and the Gospel of Matthew from \\nJoseph Smith’s inspired translation or revision of the King James Bible \\n(known today among Latter-day Saints as the Joseph Smith Translation)\\n• The book of Abraham, an inspired translation of some Egyptian papyri \\nacquired by the Prophet in the summer of 1835\\n• Extracts from the Prophet’s personal history composed in the summer \\nof 1838 and serialized in Church newspapers both in North America \\nand Europe beginning in 1842\\n• Extracts from the Doctrine and Covenants, one of the three canonical \\nbooks of the Church at the time (along with the Bible and the Book \\nof Mormon)', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 0', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='ii   |   Introduction\\n• An extract from an 1842 account of Joseph Smith’s history describing \\nthe foundational beliefs of the Church\\n• A poem composed by Elder John Jaques titled “Truth”\\nThe Pearl of Great Price was immensely valued by the Saints in Great \\nBritain, who then had convenient access to some of Joseph Smith’s most im -\\npactful revelations and historical writings. But it was not long until Elder \\nRichards’s pamphlet, which was intended primarily for British Latter-day \\nSaints far removed from the bulwark of Zion in Utah, grew beyond its initial \\naudience. By the end of the decade, the Pearl of Great Price was being cited in \\ngeneral conferences in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and it was eventually realized \\nthat a second edition would be necessary to satisfy increasing demand. Ac -\\ncordingly, in 1878 Elder Orson Pratt of the Quorum of the Twelve—with the \\nassistance of Elder Richards and fellow Apostles Elders Albert Carrington, \\nBrigham Y oung Jr., and George Q. Cannon—produced a second edition of \\nthe Pearl of Great Price that made significant revisions in both content and \\nstructure to the first edition while remaining true to the book’s original in -\\ntent. Two years later on Sunday, October 10, 1880—the fifth day of the Fif -\\ntieth Annual General Conference of the Church—President Cannon, First \\nCounselor in the First Presidency, proposed before the assembled body of \\nSaints that the Pearl of Great Price be sustained as  the Church’s fourth book \\nof scripture and be “binding upon us as a people and a Church. ” The proposal \\nwas sustained unanimously. \\nAfter its canonization, the Pearl of Great Price underwent three more \\nmajor editions: one produced in 1902 under the supervision of James E. Tal -\\nmage, another in 1921 under the supervision of Elder Talmage and other \\nmembers of the Quorum of the Twelve, and a third in 1981 (revised in 2013), \\nwhich is the current official edition of the Church. The 1902 edition prepared \\nby Elder Talmage standardized the contents of the Pearl of Great Price: the \\nbook of Moses, the book of Abraham, the “Writings of Joseph Smith” (lat -\\ner Joseph Smith—Matthew and Joseph Smith—History), and the Articles of \\nFaith. Two revelations added to the Pearl of Great Price on April 3, 1976, \\nwere moved a few years later in 1979 to the Doctrine and Covenants, becom -\\ning sections 137 and 138 of that book. Otherwise, the content of the Pearl of \\nGreat Price (including its versification), known and cherished by Latter-day \\nSaints today, has remained effectively the same for over one hundred years.\\nAlthough diminutive in size, the Pearl of Great Price has had a profound \\nimpact on the faith of the Latter-day Saints. It is a book of scripture that spans \\ndispensations. It reveals the grand scope of Creation as it unfolded under the \\ndirection of God and His Only Begotten; it reaches far back into the history \\nof God’s interactions with His children, preserving heretofore unknown ac -\\ncounts from the lives of Adam, Eve, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Moses; it \\nnarrates the calling of Joseph Smith as prophet, seer, and revelator in modern', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 1', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Introduction   |   iii \\ntimes; it provides clear warnings about the signs and tribulations the Saints \\nshould expect as the world prepares to receive the Son of Man in His glory; \\nand it provides a useful outline of the Saints’ fundamental principles of faith. \\nIt is a book that encompasses the beginning and the end, situating its readers \\nin a worldview that predates humanity and extends well beyond the confines \\nof this earth.\\nIn harmony with the Lord’s commandment to “seek learning, even by \\nstudy and also by faith” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:118), over the course \\nof many decades Latter-day Saint scholars have probed the contents of the \\nPearl of Great Price with the tools of scholarship. Successive generations \\nof committed disciple-scholars who have closely studied the Pearl of Great \\nPrice have reaped a bountiful harvest, offering many important insights that \\ngreatly enhance appreciation for this remarkable text. Readers of the Pearl of \\nGreat Price today have access to a treasure trove of academic resources that \\nmake studying the text relatively easy and immensely rewarding.\\nTo help facilitate awareness of these resources and to provide a sense of \\nhow they might be usefully synthesized to increase faith and understanding, \\nthe creation of a study edition of the Pearl of Great Price felt both appropriate \\nand needful. The offering presented here, The Pearl of Great Price: A Study Edi -\\ntion for Latter-day Saints , hopes to satisfy the counsel given in Doctrine and \\nCovenants 88:118 and to help both new and longtime members of The Church \\nof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints magnify their study of this sacred text.\\nThe idea for this study edition had its genesis with the work of Book of \\nMormon Central, a nonprofit research foundation dedicated to making the \\nBook of Mormon accessible, comprehensible, and defensible to the entire \\nworld. In its early years, Book of Mormon Central focused exclusively on \\nmaking academic resources on the Book of Mormon accessible to a growing \\ndigital audience of curious and sometimes troubled Latter-day Saints who \\nwere encountering new information about their faith at a seemingly break -\\nneck speed. In 2019, Book of Mormon Central launched Pearl of Great Price \\nCentral—the first of several planned interconnected websites in a larger dig -\\nital ecosystem—that sought to do for the Pearl of Great Price what it had al -\\nready done for the Book of Mormon. By the end of 2020, Pearl of Great Price \\nCentral had produced dozens of short, informative articles on the individual \\nbooks of the Pearl of Great Price, extensive bibliographies and archival re -\\nsources, Y ouTube videos and podcasts, an online study edition of the book of \\nAbraham, and a digital book on Joseph Smith’s First Vision. With these and \\nother academic resources in mind (and, as mentioned above, with a desire to \\nraise the Saints’ engagement with the text), research associates and members \\nof the executive board of Book of Mormon Central felt a study edition of the \\nPearl of Great Price would be an excellent medium for delivering this content \\nto a broad general audience.', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 2', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='iv   |   Introduction\\nAlthough this study edition endeavors to be informative and offer \\ngrounded readings of the text, it does not presume to offer the final say on \\nhow to understand or otherwise interpret the individual books of the Pearl \\nof Great Price. Furthermore, the commentary offered herein has been delib -\\nerately kept short and focused so as not to draw readers’ attention away from \\nwhat matters most: the inspired scriptural text. As is true with any commen -\\ntary, there is much that had to be left unsaid and many avenues of thought \\nthat had to remain unexplored out of practical necessity. For example, the \\nmatter of how to harmonize the scriptural accounts of Creation or the his -\\ntorical lives of Adam and Eve with the findings of modern science has been \\nleft alone for the simple reason that the proper approach to these important \\ntopics requires the laying of more scholarly and exegetical groundwork than \\ncould be provided in the commentary offered herein. Similarly, because it is \\nthe prerogative of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apos -\\ntles to determine doctrine for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, \\nthis study edition has largely avoided providing doctrinal explication on the \\ntext. Because devotional and pastoral application of scriptural teaching is so \\ndeeply personalized to the needs of the individual, such has also been left  \\nalone in this study edition. The focus of the commentary provided in this \\nstudy edition is, consequently, predominantly historical, linguistic, text-crit -\\nical, structural, and theological—that is, this edition attempts to understand \\nthe broader significance of the text’s religious message. Both a general bibli -\\nography for the study edition as a whole and specific bibliographies for each \\nscriptural book in the text have been provided, and readers are encouraged to \\nconsult the sources contained therein as well as the resources available online \\nat pearlofgreatpricecentral.org for additional scholarly insight. \\nA NOTE ON THE TEXT  \\nThe text underlying this study edition of the Pearl of Great Price is the \\ncurrent (2013) official edition published by The Church of Jesus Christ of \\nLatter-day Saints. (With the kind permission of the Church, Book of Mor -\\nmon Central has been granted a license to use the current official edition of \\nthe scriptures in its study material.) To simplify readability, this study edi -\\ntion has repunctuated and reformatted the 2013 text with, for example, new \\nheadings to subdivide the text into meaningful narrative units. Otherwise, \\nit remains unchanged from the 2013 text. Significant or meaningful textual \\nvariants from past editions are noted and discussed in the commentary.', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 3', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='The Book of Moses   |   1 \\nThe Book of Moses\\nIntroduction\\nHistory\\nIn June 1830—just months after the publication of the Book of Mormon on \\nMarch 26, 1830, and the founding of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day \\nSaints on April 6, 1830—Joseph Smith received an extraordinary revelation \\nconcerning a previously unknown incident in the life of the biblical prophet \\nMoses. This revelation brought to light “the words of God which he spake \\nunto Moses at a time when Moses was caught up into an exceedingly high \\nmountain” (Moses 1:1). This revelation, now known as the first chapter of \\nthe book of Moses, was the first tangible result of an inspired translation or \\nrevision of the Bible that the Prophet occupied himself with for at least the \\nnext three years of his life. The resulting text (known today as the Joseph \\nSmith Translation of the Bible but simply designated a “new translation” by \\nthe Prophet himself [see Doctrine and Covenants 124:89]), and especially \\nthe portion related to Genesis 1:1–6:13 now canonized as the book of Moses, \\nhas profoundly influenced Latter-day Saint theology. \\nThe content from Joseph Smith’s revision of the King James Bible pre -\\nserved today in the canonical book of Moses was revealed, or translated, \\nbetween June 1830 and February 1831. Assisting the Prophet as scribes in \\nthis portion of the work were Oliver Cowdery, John Whitmer, Emma Smith, \\nand Sidney Rigdon. By the spring of 1831, after the Saints had relocated to \\nKirtland, Ohio, this initial dictated manuscript, commonly designated Old \\nTestament Manuscript/Revision 1 (OT1), was copied and revised under the \\ndirection of Joseph Smith. It served as the base text from which the Prophet \\ncompleted the rest of his translation of the Old Testament, which is referred \\nto as Old Testament Manuscript/Revision 2 (OT2). However, some revisions \\ncontinued to be made to the original dictated manuscript as well. Whereas \\nOT1 reflects the Prophet’s initial prophetic outpouring connected to the Bible \\nrevision project, OT2, with its numerous revisions and emendations, appears', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 4', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='2   |   The Book of Moses\\nto essentially reflect the final form of the text as intended by the Prophet. To -\\ngether, OT1 and OT2 constitute the earliest extant manuscripts of the book \\nof Moses (and the rest of the Joseph Smith Translation) and are profitably \\nstudied together to discern how the Joseph Smith Translation, including the \\nbook of Moses, grew out of an unfolding, “line upon line” revelatory process \\n(2 Nephi 28:30; Doctrine and Covenants 98:12).\\nIn addition to early manuscript copies of the text that circulated among \\nsome Latter-day Saints, portions of the book of Moses appeared in print as \\nearly as August 1832, when William W . Phelps published what is now Moses \\n7 in The Evening and the Morning Star  in Independence, Missouri. Addition -\\nal excepts from the book of Moses (including what is now designated Moses \\n5:1–16; 6:43–68; and 8:13–30) appeared in print not long thereafter. In the \\n1835 first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, excerpts from the transla -\\ntion of Genesis were quoted in the Lectures on Faith, further signifying the \\nimportance the early Saints attached to the Prophet’s biblical revisions. On \\none occasion Joseph Smith indicated that it was “not the will of the Lord” for \\nthe New Translation to be published serially as other histories or revelations \\nwere but that it would be published as a single volume instead. (The New \\nTestament was intended to also be published together with the Book of Mor -\\nmon.) He accordingly made serious though unfruitful efforts to publish the \\ntext in its entirety during his lifetime.\\nRecognizing the enormous value and doctrinal contributions of this text, \\nElder Franklin D. Richards included portions of the book of Moses in the \\n1851 first edition of the Pearl of Great Price, drawing from both previously \\npublished excerpts and, it appears, unpublished manuscript copies in circu -\\nlation at the time. Unlike the text’s current form, however, Richards’s version \\nbegan with Moses 6–7 and then followed with Moses 1–5, 8. The text un -\\nderwent further modification in the 1878 second edition prepared by Elder \\nOrson Pratt. Besides rearranging the contents of the book of Moses into its \\ncurrent order, Pratt utilized the published edition of the New Translation—\\nthe Inspired Version prepared by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of \\nLatter Day Saints (now the Community of Christ) in 1867—as the base text \\nfor this edition. It was this edition that would become canonized two years \\nlater, thus solidifying the basic structure of the text as read and appreciated \\nby Latter-day Saints today.\\nStructure\\nThe book of Moses is recited in both first- and third-person narrative voices. \\nThe text opens with a third-person narrator describing Moses receiving a \\nseries of grand panoramic visions in which God reveals to him details about \\nthe earth and its inhabitants as well as the wider Creation. This opening \\nchapter frames the ensuing narrative by depicting God as instructing Moses', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 5', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='The Book of Moses   |   3 \\nto record the information He is about to give him concerning the Creation \\nand the early history of humanity (1:40–41; 2:1). Thereafter the text switch -\\nes to the first-person voice of God as He retells the stories of Creation, the \\nGarden of Eden, and the Fall of Adam and Eve in Genesis 1–3. At Moses 5:4, \\nhowever, the narrative voice reverts to the third person for the remainder of \\nthe canonical text. The cumulative effect of this narrative disjointedness blurs \\nthe lines between the primary narrators within the text (God and Moses) and \\nJoseph Smith as the modern prophetic intermediary who rendered it into the \\nfamiliar biblical idiom of the King James Bible for modern readers.\\nEmbedded in the narrative of the book of Moses is a series of visions and \\nrevelations given to the primeval ancestors of humanity. Readers thus en -\\ncounter revelations given to Moses (1:3–9, 24–41), Adam and Eve (6:51–68), \\nand Enoch (7:2–11, 23–59, 65–67) as they progress through the story. They \\nlikewise encounter sometimes lengthy discourses, most notably Enoch’s ex -\\ntended address at 6:40–7:1. Also woven into the narrative are artfully execut -\\ned literary and thematic elements, such as the stark moral dichotomies de -\\npicted between the wicked descendants of Cain (5:42–57) and the righteous \\ndescendants of Seth (6:10–25), or the juxtaposition of Adam as the proto -\\ntypical priest of God offering sacrifice in the similitude of the Only Begotten \\n(5:4–12) and Cain as the prototypical priest of Satan offering his brother as \\nhumanity’s first martyr (5:26–41). Poetic elements likewise feature in the text \\n(7:41, 48), as do irony (5:33) and immense pathos (7:28–37). As a literary \\nwork, the book of Moses is abundantly rich.\\nBeing, as it is, in part a revision of the text of the King James Version of \\nGenesis 1:1–6:13, the book of Moses, of course, parallels the familiar biblical \\nstories of the early chapters of Genesis. However, at several key points the text \\nradically departs from the biblical text, introducing new themes, doctrines, \\ncharacters, and narrative points. Satan, for example, who is absent from the \\nGenesis text, makes several open appearances in the narrative as the chief \\nantagonist of the drama (see Moses 1:12–23; 4:1–4; 5:13–15, 18–31). Like -\\nwise, the mention (and presence) of God’s Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, \\npervades the narrative. Although mentioned only briefly (and cryptically) at \\nGenesis 5:18–24, Enoch plays a significant role in Joseph Smith’s reworking \\nof the biblical material, prominently occupying nearly two chapters (Moses \\n6:26–7:69) out of the eight that presently constitute the book of Moses. The \\nprophet Noah, who otherwise utters not a single word of dialogue in the \\nGenesis text, is recast in the book of Moses as a preacher of righteousness \\nwarning the evil inhabitants of earth of the impending deluge (8:23–24). \\nThese expansions afford the book of Moses, in many points, a remarkable \\nresemblance to the so-called “rewritten Bible” tradition that flourished in \\nancient Judaism and Christianity (a point that has been appreciated by both \\nLatter-day Saint and non-Latter-day Saint commentators).', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 6', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='4   |   The Book of Moses\\nSignificance for Latter-day Saints\\nAs mentioned above, excerpts from Joseph Smith’s translation of Genesis \\nwere already circulating in print in the decades leading up to their inclusion \\nin the 1851 first edition of the Pearl of Great Price. Latter-day Saints both \\nthen and now have greatly cherished the book of Moses for the knowledge it \\nrestored about the lives and teachings of Adam and Eve and other antediluvi -\\nan personalities. Without question, the crowning truth revealed in the book \\nof Moses is the primacy of the gospel of Jesus Christ and that Adam and Eve \\nwere explicitly instructed directly by God in the foundational principles and \\nordinances of this gospel (5:4–12, 58–59; 6:51–68). This reconfiguration of \\nthe Genesis account to include plain mention of the salvific work of Jesus \\nChrist in the earliest stages of human history drastically impacts how Lat -\\nter-day Saints conceive God’s unchanging, eternal plan of salvation for all \\nHis children.\\nIn addition to making clear the primacy of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the \\nBook of Moses also prefigures the rise and triumph of Zion in the latter days. \\nAs narrated in the text, Enoch and his people attained such a level of holiness \\nin their Zion community that they ultimately enjoyed the blessing of transla -\\ntion into God’s own presence (7:18–22, 60–64, 68–69). The concept of Zion, \\nthe New Jerusalem, in Latter-day Saint religious consciousness can in no small \\nmeasure be traced back to this foundational text, which underpins the sub -\\nsequent revelations Joseph Smith received on the establishment of latter-day \\nZion in anticipation of the return of Enoch’s holy city at the Second Coming of \\nthe Son of Man (Moses 7:60–64; D&C 45; 97:18–28). The book of Moses has \\nlikewise greatly impacted Latter-day Saint temple theology and worship, and \\nan increasing consensus among Latter-day Saint scholars sees chapters 2–8 of \\nthe text as a temple text—an account of ritual ascent that is comparable with \\nthe account of Moses’s heavenly ascent in the opening chapter. \\nOne of the most profound passages in the book of Moses that affects the \\nLatter-day Saint understanding of the nature of God comes from Enoch’s \\nvision recorded at 7:23–40, wherein the prophet, to his great astonishment, \\nbeholds in vision God weeping in sorrow because of the abject wickedness \\nof His children. This moving display both refutes sectarian notions of an im -\\nmutable, impassible deity and reorients how Latter-day Saints imagine their \\nrelationship with God as their Father. Other vivid anthropomorphisms in \\nthe text (see Moses 1:6, 13, 16; 2:26–27; 6:57; 7:35) have become an integral \\npart of the scriptural foundation from which Joseph Smith and subsequent \\nLatter-day Saint thinkers have built compelling theologies concerning the \\nnature of God.\\nWith the modern rediscovery of forgotten or neglected ancient apoc -\\nryphal texts—texts that also narrate accounts of the lives of Adam and Eve, \\nEnoch, Noah, and other ancient prophets—Latter-day Saint scholars have,', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 7', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='The Book of Moses   |   5 \\nwith considerable interest, scoured these and other sources in search of par -\\nallels with the book of Moses. The results of these investigations have been \\nunquestionably impressive, with noteworthy convergences between Joseph \\nSmith’s revealed text and related ancient sources. Especially significant are \\nthe parallels that the Enoch material in the book of Moses shares with the \\ncorpus of apocryphal Enoch texts, which, as scholars now rightly recognize, \\nplayed a pivotal role in shaping much of the thinking of ancient Judaism and \\nChristianity. While this evidence does not “prove” the historical authenticity \\nor divine inspiration of the book of Moses, it nevertheless reinforces Lat -\\nter-day Saints’ belief that with his inspired revision of Genesis, Joseph Smith \\ntapped into genuinely ancient wells of thought and even restored ignored \\nor forgotten accounts and themes. While questions remain about to what \\ndegree the book of Moses reflects the recovery of ancient Mosaic writings as \\nopposed to being Joseph Smith’s modern, inspired expansions on the bibli -\\ncal text (questions that will largely remain unresolved without more ancient \\nmanuscript witnesses), what cannot be doubted are the ancient congruencies \\nin the text, to say nothing of the book’s profound doctrinal contributions to \\nthe Restoration.  \\nSelected Bibliography\\nBradshaw, Jeffrey M.

The first line of OT1 iden -\\ntifies this text simply as “ A Revelation given to Joseph the Revelator June 1830. ” Scholars con -\\ntinue to wonder if Moses 1 is a standalone revelation or if it acts as a sort of preface to the rest \\nof the Prophet’s inspired revision of the book of Genesis. Moses 1:40 appears to indicate that \\nthe account preserved in this chapter is a sort of framing device for the subsequent narrative. \\nAlthough 1:40–41 indicates that Moses recorded his experience, without recourse to any an -\\ncient manuscripts it is unknown how much of this chapter is a restoration of lost text as op -\\nposed to Joseph Smith’s expansive revelation about an important (but otherwise unknown) \\nincident in Moses’s life. 1:1–2  Moses being “caught up” into a high mountain and beholding \\nthe glory of God face-to-face evokes a temple setting and context comparable to imagery at -\\ntested throughout the Hebrew Bible and other ancient sources. Latter-day Saint commentators \\nhave written extensively on this chapter, noting its similarity to other ascension texts wherein \\na prophet ascends into the presence of God and receives a divine commission. The striking \\nparallels between Moses 1 and this body of ancient literature are undeniable. (Consult the \\nbibliography for representative samples of this scholarship.) Saw God face to face.  Compare \\nExodus 33:11; Deuteronomy 34:10. Other prophets so privileged to have beheld the Lord “face \\nto face” include, but are not limited to, Enoch (Moses 7:4), Abraham (Abraham 3:11), Jacob \\n(Genesis 32:30), and Moroni (Ether 12:39). 1:3 Endless . Compare Moses 7:35. (see additional \\nclarification on this name for God provided in Doctrine and Covenants 19:4–12.) 1:4 This is \\nthe first of several instances in this chapter where Moses is for the first time declared to be a \\nson of God (compare Moses 1:6–7, 13, 40). The status of Moses as a son of God will feature \\nprominently later in the narrative when Lucifer attempts to deceive Moses into worshipping \\nhim (1:12–13). The Hebrew phrase “son of God” ( ben ʾelohim ) denotes a divine or supernat -\\nural being. As a son of heavenly parents along with the rest of humanity, Moses was indeed a Text and Commentary\\nThe Book of Moses\\nAn Extract From Joseph Smith’s New Translation of the Bible', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 11', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='The Book of Moses   |   9 \\nson of God. But in this context, the phrase likely implies more than mere divine parentage, \\nsignaling Moses’s status as a participant in God’s heavenly divine council. 1:5 The phrase “on \\nthe earth” is absent from OT1 and was inserted interlineally in OT2. The implication seems to \\nbe that anybody who experiences the full scope and extent of God’s eternal glory throughout \\nCreation cannot be withheld from a greater or more permanent level of deification, and there -\\nfore Moses was shown only a portion thereof. 1:6 Here the title of “Only Begotten” is invoked \\nfor the first time. This epithet will feature prominently throughout the rest of the book (see \\nMoses 2:1, 24–27; 3:18; 4:1, 3, 28; 5:7–9, 57; 6:52, 57, 59, 62; 7:50, 59, 62). As used in the New \\nTestament, the term derives from the Greek monogenēs  (with equivalents in Hebrew and Ar -\\namaic: yĕḥîd ) and is featured in other scripture as a title for Jesus (see John 3:16; Alma 5:48; \\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:23). It carries a sense of possessing a unique or special relation -\\nship to somebody else and otherwise of being “one of a kind. ” (Isaac is afforded this attribute \\nat Genesis 22:2 and Hebrews 11:17 even though Ishmael was his older half-brother.) No God \\nbeside me . See also Isaiah 45:5, 21–22; Hosea 13:4–5; Doctrine and Covenants 76:1. This dec -\\nlaration is an affirmation of God’s incomparable status as the Father of humanity and Lord of \\nCreation, not necessarily a declaration of His sole existence. Indeed, as depicted unmistakably \\nthroughout the text, besides God stands His Only Begotten Son. 1:8 Children of men . The \\nHebrew meaning of this term ( bĕnêy ʾadam ) is simply “mortals, humans” (compare Abraham \\n3:27) 1:10  Compare Joseph Smith—History 1:20, where the Prophet Joseph Smith reports \\nbeing similarly exhausted after his visionary experience. See also 1 Nephi 1:6–7; Alma 19:6.  \\n1:11  In the ancient mindset, encountering God or other divine beings was considered extraor -\\ndinarily dangerous and potentially fatal (see Exodus 33:20; Judges 6:22–23; 13:21–23), for \\nprecisely the same reason given here. 1:12  Satan appears in the narrative here for the first time thee, Moses, my son. And thou art in \\nthe similitude of mine Only Begotten. \\nAnd mine Only Begotten is and shall \\nbe the Savior, for he is full of grace and \\ntruth.

For thou art in the world, and \\nnow I show it unto thee. ” 8\\xa0And it came \\nto pass that Moses looked, and beheld \\nthe world upon which he was created. \\nAnd Moses beheld the world and the \\nends thereof, and all the children of \\nmen which are, and which were cre -\\nated. Of the same he greatly marveled \\nand wondered. 9\\xa0And the presence of \\nGod withdrew from Moses, that his \\nglory was not upon Moses. And Moses \\nwas left unto himself.

For behold, I am a son of \\nGod, in the similitude of his Only Be -\\ngotten. And where is thy glory, that \\nI should worship thee? 14\\xa0For behold, \\nI could not look upon God, except \\nhis glory should come upon me, and \\nI were transfigured before him.

And I can judge \\nbetween thee and God. For God said \\nunto me, ‘Worship God, for him only \\nshalt thou serve. ’ 16\\xa0Get thee hence, \\nSatan. Deceive me not. For God said \\nunto me, ‘Thou art after the simili -\\ntude of mine Only Begotten. ’ 17\\xa0And he also gave me commandments \\nwhen he called unto me out of the \\nburning bush, saying, ‘Call upon God \\nin the name of mine Only Begotten, \\nand worship me. ’” 18\\xa0And again Mo -\\nses said, “I will not cease to call upon \\nGod, I have other things to inquire of \\nhim. For his glory has been upon me; \\nwherefore I can judge between him \\nand thee. Depart hence, Satan. ” \\n19\\xa0And now, when Moses had said \\nthese words, Satan cried with a loud \\nvoice, and ranted upon the earth, \\nand commanded, saying, “I am the \\nOnly Begotten. Worship me!” 20\\xa0And \\nit came to pass that Moses began to \\nfear exceedingly. And as he began \\nto fear, he saw the bitterness of hell. \\nNevertheless, calling upon God, he \\nreceived strength, and he command -\\ned, saying, “Depart from me, Satan, \\nfor this one God only will I worship, \\nand will be a prominent antagonist throughout the rest of the account, scheming to influence \\nthe lives of the children of Adam and Eve in deleterious ways. Son of man . Satan demotes \\nMoses’s status to that of a mere mortal in an attempt to command his allegiance, seemingly \\nunaware of God’s declaration at Moses 1:4. Moses counters in the next verse and at 1:16 by \\naffirming his ennobling status as a son of God in the “similitude” (that is, likeness or resem -\\nblance) of God’s Only Begotten. 1:15  Darkness unto me . Both OT1 and OT2 use the word \\n“blackness” instead of “darkness. ” This earlier reading may evoke a more visceral visual expe -\\nrience on Moses’s part (that is, Satan’s imitative glory is as the pitch blackness of night com -\\npared to the splendor and glory of God) and might relate to the “blackness” that characterizes \\nthe people of Canaan at 7:8 and the descendants of Cain in 7:22. (See also the commentary on \\nthese verses.) 1:17  This verse preserves one of God’s instructions to Moses otherwise unattest -\\ned in the Hebrew Bible (see Exodus 3). 1:18  OT1 and OT2 add “and it is glory unto me” after \\n“his glory has been upon me. ” 1:19  Satan ranted upon the earth . OT1 and OT2 both read that \\nSatan “wrent” upon the earth. This is most likely a variant of “rent” (the past tense of “rend”), \\nmeaning that Satan broke up the earth around Moses in a terrible display of fury. The change \\nto “ranted” occurred in the 1981 edition of the Pearl of Great Price. With either verb the im -\\nagery is basically the same: Satan, out of desperation and anger that Moses refused to worship \\nhim, lashed out in some type of terrifying display (see also 1:21). I am the Only Begotten . With \\nthis declaration, Satan desperately attempts to reassert his status as a once-ranking member of \\nthe divine council. He is, in effect, attempting still to subvert the Father’s plan even after his \\ndisastrous attempt to claim glory for himself in the premortal council (compare 4:1–4; Abra -\\nham 3:24–28).  1:20  Compare the description given by Joseph Smith of his encounter with', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 13', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='The Book of Moses   |   11 \\nwhich is the God of glory. ” 21\\xa0And now \\nSatan began to tremble, and the earth \\nshook. And Moses received strength, \\nand called upon God, saying, “In \\nthe name of the Only Begotten, de -\\npart hence, Satan. ” 22\\xa0And it came \\nto pass that Satan cried with a loud \\nvoice, with weeping, and wailing, \\nand gnashing of teeth, and he depart -\\ned hence, even from the presence of \\nMoses, that he beheld him not. 23\\xa0And \\nnow of this thing Moses bore record, \\nbut because of wickedness it is not \\nhad among the children of men.\\nThe Second \\nTransfiguration and \\nVision of Moses\\n24\\xa0And it came to pass that when Satan \\nhad departed from the presence of \\nMoses, that Moses lifted up his eyes \\nunto heaven, being filled with the \\nHoly Ghost, which beareth record of \\nthe Father and the Son. 25\\xa0And calling \\nupon the name of God, he beheld his \\nglory again, for it was upon him.

For \\nthou shalt deliver my people from \\nbondage, even Israel my chosen. ” \\n27\\xa0And it came to pass, as the voice \\nwas still speaking, Moses cast his eyes \\nand beheld the earth, yea, even all of \\nit, and there was not a particle of it \\nwhich he did not behold, discerning \\nit by the Spirit of God. 28\\xa0And he be -\\nheld also the inhabitants thereof, and \\nthere was not a soul which he beheld \\nnot, and he discerned them by the \\nSpirit of God. And their numbers \\nwere great, even numberless as the \\nsand upon the seashore. 29\\xa0And he be -\\nheld many lands, and each land was \\ncalled earth, and there were inhabi -\\ntants on the face thereof. \\n30\\xa0And it came to pass that Mo -\\nses called upon God, saying, “Tell \\nme, I pray thee, why these things are \\nso, and by what thou madest them. ” \\nSatan in the Sacred Grove in Joseph Smith—History 1:15–16. 1:21  In OT1 and OT2 Moses \\nexplicitly calls upon the name of Jesus Christ to rebuke Satan. Two subsequent scribal edits \\nchanged this to “his Son” and then finally “the Only Begotten, ” the latter of which was used by \\nOrson Pratt in the 1878 edition and subsequent editions of the Pearl of Great Price. Moses’s \\ninvoking the name of the Only Begotten as opposed to the name Jesus Christ is more in har -\\nmony with the repeated mention of this title throughout the previous verses, which perhaps \\naccounts for the change. 1:22  Weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth is characteristic of Sa -\\ntan and those who share his eternal fate (see Mosiah 16:2; Alma 40:13; Doctrine and Cove -\\nnants 19:5; 101:91; 133:73). 1:24 The imagery of Moses lifting up his eyes to behold another \\nheavenly vision reflects a common biblical idiom sometimes used in visionary or quasi-vi -\\nsionary contexts (see Genesis 13:10, 14; 18:2; 22:4, 13; 24:63; 31:10, 12; 33:1; Exodus 14:10; \\nNumbers 24:2; Deuteronomy 4:19; Psalm 121:1; 123:1; Isaiah 40:26; see also the commentary \\nat Abraham 3:11–12). 1:25  Compare Exodus 7:1, where the Lord declares that Moses is “a god \\nto Pharaoh. ” The promise that Moses will have power over the waters is an obvious allusion to \\nthe parting of the Red Sea (see Exodus 14:21–31). 1:29  Moses beholds in vision many lands \\ncalled “earth. ” The immediate context and Moses 1:40 suggest that Moses is beholding many \\nlands and their inhabitants on this planet, with each land called “earth” (Hebrew: ʾereṣ , “land,', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 14', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='12   |   The Book of Moses\\n31\\xa0And behold, the glory of the Lord \\nwas upon Moses, so that Moses stood \\nin the presence of God, and talked \\nwith him face to face.

As with Abraham (in Abraham 3:11) the context is a visionary glimpse of \\nCreation. 1:32  The Only Begotten is identified as the Word of God’s power, anticipating the \\nprofound Logos hymn of John 1:1–18. 1:33  Compare Doctrine and Covenants 76:23–24. 1:34 \\nThe gloss provided in this verse identifies Adam as “many” (although the antecedent to “many” \\ncould also be “man” or “men, ” a reading that is reinforced by Moses 4:26). Coupled with 1:29, \\nthis may suggest a plurality of “ Adams” who inhabit many lands called “earth” throughout \\nGod’s Creation. 1:35–36  The Creation that God reveals to Moses pertains only to this world \\n(compare 1:40; 2:1), leaving open for speculation the nature of the rest of God’s innumerable \\nCreations. The infinite and grand scope of God’s creative power throughout the cosmos as \\ndescribed in this text leaves the reader overwhelmed with a simultaneous sense of both aston -\\nishment and nothingness (compare Moses’s reaction at 1:10). 1:37  OT1 begins this verse with \\n“ And the Lord God spake unto Moses saying The Heavens there are many. ” This was revised in \\nOT2 to read: “ And the Lord God spake unto Moses of the Heavens saying these are many. ” 1:39 \\nThis verse—cherished and cited by Latter-day Saints as a short encapsulation of the purpose \\nand intention behind God’s plan of salvation—is explicitly couched in the context of the pur -\\npose behind Creation and humanity’s existence.

In the OT1 rendering, the work of the Father in bringing about the \\nimmortality and eternal life of humankind is depicted more forcefully as being commensurate \\nor proportional with the increase of His glory. In other words, as more of His children attain \\nimmortality and eternal life, the glory of the Father increases. This subtly anticipates teachings \\nmade by the Prophet Joseph Smith toward the end of his life that the eternal life and exaltation \\nof God and His children compound as they continue to progress through the eternities. 1:42 \\nThis injunction to secrecy is especially appropriate when the account is viewed as a temple text \\nand an apocalypse—that is, a revelation that unveils mysteries or secrets about the world, its \\ndestiny, and God’s plans for humanity (see the commentary for 7:65–67). A common feature \\nin Jewish and Christian apocalyptic literature is the urge to keep the contents of revelations \\nsecret or otherwise shielded from profane or unworthy readers (compare Daniel 8:26 and also \\nMatthew 17:9; Mark 9:9, where Jesus swears the disciples to secrecy after His own transfigura -\\ntion on a high mount).\\n2 This chapter commences the first of two Creation accounts found in the book of Moses that \\ncorrespond to Genesis 1:1–2:3. OT1 and OT2 respectively begin this chapter by designating \\nit as “chapter first” and “The Book of Genesis Chapter first, ” which seems to indicate some \\nintention behind its being the opening chapter of the Prophet’s inspired revision of Genesis. \\nAs mentioned previously, it is unclear if the preceding chapter describing Moses’s visionary \\nexperience on the mount is a standalone revelation or a prologue to the narrative that com -\\nmences with this chapter. (Based on internal textual cues, the latter seems more likely.) 2:1 \\nThe Lord spake unto Moses . In a radical departure from the Genesis text, which features an \\nanonymous third-person narrator throughout, this chapter opens at first with an anonymous \\nthird-person narrator (Moses?) but then immediately shifts to the Lord narrating the details \\nof Creation directly to Moses in the first person. In this respect, the text bears striking resem -\\nblance to the apocryphal book of Jubilees, which also begins with Moses’s being summoned \\nto a high mountain where the Lord (or the angel of the Lord) gives an account of the Creation \\nand other events from early biblical history that Moses is commanded to record.

This will feature more prominently later (at 2:26) and is in harmony with \\nthe book of Abraham’s depiction of Creation, which also speaks of more than one divini -\\nty participating (Abraham 4:1). 2:2 The earth being without form and void ( tôhû wā-bôhû ), \\nwith “darkness” ( ḥôšek ) being upon the face of the “deep” ( tĕhôm ), all evokes a sense of the \\ncosmos in its primordial, uninhabitable condition (compare Abraham 4:2). 2:3 My Spirit . The \\nHebrew word used in Genesis 1:2 for “spirit” ( rûaḥ ) can also mean “wind, breath. ” Alongside \\nthe presence of God’s Only Begotten and Word (Moses 2:5), it is difficult not to read the text \\nas describing the presence of each member of the Godhead in this scene. 2:4 OT1 has the de -\\nfinitive article “the” instead of the demonstrative “that” modifying “light. ” 2:5 OT1 has “Word” \\ncapitalized.

Image and likeness . Besides the obvious impli -\\ncations this language has for divine anthropomorphism and corporeality (compare Genesis \\n5:3; Ether 3:15–17), the language of humanity being in the image and likeness of God and His \\nOnly Begotten hearkens to the prevalent ancient Near Eastern practice of placing an image \\nof a deity in a temple or shrine. Here God and His Son are enshrined, as it were, in Their \\nnewly formed terrestrial temple—the earth—through the creation of humanity. Furthermore, \\nroyalty in the ancient Near East was sometimes said to be in the image or likeness of a given \\npatron deity, meaning the monarch had been endowed with a divine nature and was thus the \\nmortal representative of the deity on earth. This concept is democratized in here, in the book \\nof Abraham, and in Genesis to extend to all of humanity. Dominion over the earth . Humanity \\nis given dominion ( rādāh ; “to rule, have dominion”) over the forms of animal life heretofore \\ncreated, putting them in the role, essentially, of God’s viceroys on earth. Far from granting \\nhumanity license to exploit or abuse the earth’s ecology, humanity’s lordship over other forms \\nof animal life places on it a responsibility to treat the earth’s natural resources with care and \\nequity, as any monarch ideally would to its subjects. Wanton bloodshed, the needless taking \\nof life, and failure to show respect and restraint toward Creation is portrayed elsewhere in the \\ntext as Satanic (see Moses 5:31–33, 49–57). Male and female . Members of both sexes are said \\nto be made in the image of the God and His Only Begotten. This extends the divine nature of \\nGod to both men and women. Restoration teachings affirm the reality that all humans are the \\nsons or daughters of divine heavenly parents. Although Her presence is not explicitly depicted \\neither here or in the Genesis and Abraham accounts, it is reasonable to infer the attendance \\nof Heavenly Mother in the scene in light of modern revelation and the dichotomous male/\\nfemale pairing so described (compare Abraham 4:26–27, where an unspecified number of \\ngods create man and woman after their likeness). 2:28  Men and women are idealized as main -\\ntaining the natural order of Creation established by God through procreation.

Whereas the preceding \\naccount describes Creation on a broad, cosmic scale, this account focuses on the formation \\nof humanity and the placement of Adam and Eve in the garden. 3:5 In a detail unique to the \\nbook of Moses, the Lord indicates that He had created all things “spiritually” before creating \\nthem “physically” (compare Moses 3:7, 9). The full implication of this declaration has yet to be \\ncompletely explicated. What, precisely, does “spiritual” Creation look like?

Scholars have proposed various etymologies for \\nthe name Eden, ranging from roots meaning “steppe, plain” to “pleasure, luxury” and “boun -\\ntiful, abundance. ” That the garden was intended to be envisioned as a place of paradisiacal lux -\\nury and abundance is reinforced by the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible known \\nas the Septuagint, which renders the word for “garden” in Genesis 2:8, 15 as paradeisos . 3:10 \\nThe beginning of this verse (“I, the Lord God, caused”) was inserted in OT2. OT1 originally \\nread that “a river went out of Eden” without indicating that God was the causative agent of its \\nexistence and course. River out of Eden . The land of Eden is said to have a river flowing out of it \\nthat splits into four branches. This indicates that the land is elevated since the rivers flow away \\nfrom it. Eden’s setting on a mount, or hill, evokes temple overtones. Indeed, based on this and \\nother details, multiple scholars have persuasively argued that the Garden of Eden functions as \\na prototypical temple and Adam as a prototypical temple priest. 3:11  OT1 and OT2 originally \\nboth read, “Where there were created much gold. ” The text was modified in OT2 to include \\n“the Lord” as the creative agent. The 1902 edition of the Pearl of Great Price inserts “God” after \\n“the Lord, ” which has been used in subsequent editions. 3:11–14  Of the four rivers named in \\nthis verse, the last two (the ḥideqel  and the pĕrāt ) have been widely identified with the Tigris \\nand Euphrates Rivers of Mesopotamia, respectively.

That their agency plays an indispensable role in God’s plan of salvation has been \\nemphasized repeatedly by modern prophets and is affirmed by other books of Restoration \\nscripture (see 2 Nephi 2:15–16). 3:18  Help meet . Although commonly treated as a noun in \\nEnglish (often rendered helpmeet or help-meet, meaning a companion or partner), in fact \\nthis phrase comprises a noun (“help”) modified by an adjective (“meet”). The Hebrew phrase \\nin Genesis 2:18, 20 means something like “suitable helper, ” “a helping counterpart, ” or even \\n“a powerful counterpart” ( ʿēzer kĕnegĕdô ). This last rendering is especially attractive since it \\nboth works in context (the woman is meant to be Adam’s coworker and partner to help him in \\nways the other animals are not suitable for) and elevates Eve above her traditionally devalued \\nstatus.

OT1 and OT2 both originally read that \\nthe animals were commanded by the Lord to “be brought” to Adam, but they do not specify \\nthe agent bringing the animals. The Hebrew of Genesis 2:19 indicates that God brought the \\nanimals to Adam in that version of the narrative as captured by the King James Version, but \\nthe text here seems to indicate God is commanding someone else to bring the animals.

This intriguing interpretation of the Hebrew tardēmâ  (“deep sleep, \\nslumber”) suggests that the removal of Adam’s rib was a visionary experience rather than a \\nphysical one. Adam’s rib . The word used at Genesis 2:21–22 has traditionally been rendered \\n“rib” based in part on the ancient Greek ( pleura ) and Latin ( costa ) translations of this passage. \\nBut another possible translation is simply “side” ( ṣēlā‘ ). Other anatomical referents for this \\nword have accordingly been suggested since at least the Middle Ages.

This portion of text is \\nmissing from OT1 and was inserted into OT2. 4:10–11  The lie of the serpent is not that Adam \\nand Eve would be like gods by partaking of the fruit (Moses 4:28; compare Genesis 3:22) but \\nrather that they would not die in consequence of their action. Spiritually speaking, they died \\nat the time they ate the fruit, after which they would physically die at the end of their mortal \\nprobation (compare Helaman 14:16). 4:13–14  With their eyes now open to the reality of good \\nand evil, Adam and Eve recognize their vulnerability and nakedness before God’s presence \\n(compare Moses 4:16), whereas previously they had no such recognition (3:25; compare Gen -\\nesis 2:25). In response, they sew aprons (“girdles, loincloths”; ḥăgōrōt ) for themselves to cover \\ntheir nakedness and hide in the trees of the garden. Walking in the garden . In the Genesis \\naccount, Adam and Eve hide themselves when they hear the sound of God walking through \\nthe garden on a breezy day (Genesis 3:8). OT1 initially followed the Genesis text (“.\\xa0.\\xa0. they \\nheard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden”) but was revised to “.\\xa0.\\xa0.as they were The Serpent Tempts Eve\\n5 “ And now the serpent was more sub -\\ntle than any beast of the field which I, \\nthe Lord God, had made. 6 And Satan \\nput it into the heart of the serpent \\n(for he had drawn away many after \\nhim), and he sought also to beguile \\nEve, for he knew not the mind of \\nGod, wherefore he sought to destroy \\nthe world. 7 And he said unto the \\nwoman, ‘Y ea, hath God said, ‘Y e shall \\nnot eat of every tree of the garden’?’ \\n(And he spake by the mouth of the \\nserpent.) 8 And the woman said unto \\nthe serpent, ‘We may eat of the fruit \\nof the trees of the garden. 9 But of the \\nfruit of the tree which thou beholdest \\nin the midst of the garden, God hath \\nsaid, ‘Y e shall not eat of it, neither \\nshall ye touch it, lest ye die. ’ 10 And \\nthe serpent said unto the woman, ‘Y e \\nshall not surely die, 11 for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, \\nthen your eyes shall be opened, and \\nye shall be as gods, knowing good \\nand evil. ’ \\nAdam and Eve Eat the Fruit \\nof the Tree\\n12 “ And when the woman saw that \\nthe tree was good for food, and that \\nit became pleasant to the eyes, and a \\ntree to be desired to make her wise, \\nshe took of the fruit thereof, and did \\neat, and also gave unto her husband \\nwith her, and he did eat. 13 And the \\neyes of them both were opened, and \\nthey knew that they had been naked. \\nAnd they sewed fig leaves together \\nand made themselves aprons. 14 And \\nthey heard the voice of the Lord God, \\nas they were walking in the garden, \\nin the cool of the day.

The \\nrhetorical nature of the question has less to do with God somehow wondering where Adam is \\nand more to do with the former calling on the latter to account for his present circumstances. \\n4:20–25  As punishment for their respective roles in transgressing His command to not eat the \\nfruit of the tree, God dispenses punishments tailored to each participant: the serpent is to be \\ndebased and despised among the animals (a type for Satan), Eve is to bear children in pain \\n(ʿeṣev ), and Adam is to toil in hard labor as he supports himself and Eve. Notably, death is not \\ndecreed on either Adam or Eve as a punishment, suggesting that their foretold deaths (Moses \\n3:17) are perhaps not a God-ordained inevitability but a natural consequence of the Fall. 4:21  \\nThe antecedent to “he” at the end of this verse both here and in the biblical text (Genesis 3:15) \\nis the woman’s seed. OT1 follows the King James Version by using the pronoun “it. ” (OT2 \\ninitially follows OT1 but was revised to “he. ”) The Hebrew pronoun ( hûʾ) can mean either. \\n4:25 \\xa0The final injunction of this verse plays on both the meaning of Adam’s name (derived \\nfrom the Hebrew word for “ground, ” ʾădāma ̂) and the depiction of how God created Adam \\nat Moses 3:7 (compare Genesis 2:7). 4:26  The name Eve ( ḥawwa ̂) derives from the Hebrew \\nroot ḥyh, meaning “to live, ” and is related to the word ḥāy (“living, alive”) used immediately from the presence of the Lord God \\namongst the trees of the garden. \\n15\\xa0And I, the Lord God, called unto \\nAdam, and said unto him, ‘Where \\ngoest thou?’ 16 And he said, ‘I heard \\nthy voice in the garden, and I was \\nafraid, because I beheld that I was \\nnaked, and I hid myself. ’ 17 And I, the \\nLord God, said unto Adam, ‘Who \\ntold thee thou wast naked?

The coats of skin ( kātĕnôt ʿôr) serve as clothing \\nfor Adam and Eve as they prepare for expulsion from the garden. Due in part to the similarity \\nbetween the words in Hebrew, a tradition arose in ancient Judaism holding that instead of \\ncoats of skin, Adam and Eve were clothed by God in radiant garments of light ( kātĕnôt ʾôr). \\nOther ancient sources depict Adam and Eve as exuding a divine splendor and glory before the \\nFall. 4:28–29 \\xa0In the biblical account, God speaks to unnamed members of His divine council \\nat Genesis 3:22. Here He speaks specifically to His Only Begotten and includes a reference to \\nHis earlier declaration at Moses 3:16–17 and 4:9. 4:31  The word cherubim  (kĕrubîm , plural \\nform of kĕrub ) is likely connected to the Akkadian kāribu , which referred to divine beings \\nwho in ancient Mesopotamia served as gatekeepers of palaces and temples. Here they likewise \\nact as sentinels who guard the path to the tree of life from unauthorized trespassers (including \\nthe recently fallen Adam and Eve). Elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible the cherubim are depicted \\nas being placed atop the ark of the covenant in effigy and worked into the embroidery of the \\ntabernacle (see Exodus 25:18–20, 22; 26:1, 31; 36:8, 35; 37:7–9; Numbers 7:89) as well as into \\nthe decoration of Solomon’s temple (See 1 Kings 6:23, 25, 27–29, 32, 35; 7:29, 36; 8:6–7). Other \\nbiblical passages depict God as being enthroned above the cherubim, suggesting a close asso -\\nciation with the divine presence (see 1 Samuel 4:4; 2 Samuel 6:2; 2 Kings 19:15; Psalms 80:1; \\n99:1; Ezekiel 10:1–10). 4:32  The placement of this second injunction to secrecy is curious.

Later at Moses 5:31 this pun will be inverted into a Satan -\\nic negative when Cain declares that he “may murder and get gain. ” Cain becomes a prototype \\nfor those who enter into Satan-inspired conspiracies (that is, secret combinations) to obtain \\nworldly possessions. Who is the Lord ? Cain’s declaration prefigures the declaration of Pharaoh \\nto Moses (Exodus 5:2). The rhetorical thrust of the question is to cast aside the power of the \\nLord and reject His authority. 5:17  Abel’s name in Hebrew ( hebel ) derives from the word for \\n“breath, vapor, ” perhaps foreshadowing that he will be “snuffed out, ” as it were, by his brother \\nas the first martyr and murder victim. 5:26–31 \\xa0The biblical record is notoriously laconic when \\nit comes to the motive behind Cain’s murder of Abel, saying only that he was “very wroth” with \\nhis brother on account of the Lord’s accepting Abel’s offering over his own (Genesis 4:5).

Surely \\nthe flocks of my brother falleth into \\nmy hands. ” 34\\xa0And the Lord said unto \\nCain, “Where is Abel, thy brother?” \\nAnd he said, “I know not. Am I my \\nbrother’s keeper?” 35\\xa0And the Lord \\nsaid, “What hast thou done?

The text therefore depicts Cain’s murder of \\nAbel as cold and premeditated, not an act of violent passion as one might otherwise suppose \\nfrom reading only the biblical account. They shall surely die . In a cruel inversion of God’s pro -\\nnouncement at Moses 3:17, Satan announces that those members of Cain’s family who break \\ntheir covenant with him will forfeit their life (a fate that will befall Cain’s grandson Irad at \\n5:50). Done in secret . The text depicts the pact that Cain enters into with Satan as the prototyp -\\nical secret combination (compare Helaman 6:26–27). Once again, the narrative contrasts the \\ngodly, positive depiction of Adam as the prototypical priest offering sacrifice in the name of \\nthe Only Begotten with the depiction of Cain as a false priest offering Abel as a sacrifice in the \\nname of Satan. Master Mahan . The etymology of Mahan is unknown, but is perhaps related to \\nthe Hebrew māḥâ  (“to wipe out, annihilate”), which would be thematically consistent with \\nCain’s declaration at Moses 5:31. In OT1 the name is given as Mahon. 5:33 \\xa0Cain’s declaration \\n(“I am free!”) upon murdering his brother could not be more tragically ironic since he now \\nfinds himself firmly in bondage to Satan. This statement also indicates that Satan has a coun -\\nterfeit for the type of freedom the Lord granted earlier in the narrative to Adam and Eve (see \\n3:16–17). 5:38\\xa0 In another narrative inversion, Cain attempts to shift the blame for his trans -\\ngression onto Satan, not unlike the attempt his mother made previously at 4:19.

The underlying Hebrew of this verse has Eve \\ngiving Seth his name but is somewhat ambiguous grammatically as to whether she or Adam \\nmade the exclamation (although contextually it seems to be Eve). Ancient versions (including \\nthe Septuagint and the Aramaic Targum Onkelos) clearly have Eve making the pronounce -\\nment. Interestingly, some apocryphal sources, such as the book of Jubilees, depict Adam as \\nnaming Seth and making the declaration. The name Seth ( šēt) derives from the word “to set, \\nappoint” ( šît), as reflected in the pronouncement that God “appointed” Seth to be a replace -\\nment to Abel (compare Genesis 4:25). 6:5–9  Genesis 5:1 mentions a “book of the generations \\nof Adam, ” but here the text greatly expands on this concept and restores details not present in \\nthe biblical record.

In his possession was a collection of Egyptian mummies and papyrus \\nscrolls. After exhibiting the antiquities to Joseph Smith on July 3, 1835, the \\nProphet determined that one of the scrolls contained the writings of Abraham \\nand another, the writings of Joseph of Egypt. He subsequently purchased at \\nleast four or five papyrus documents and four mummies from Chandler for \\nthe sum of $2,400 and set about efforts to translate the records. Precisely how \\nJoseph translated the papyri is unknown. Contemporary sources indicate \\nthat the Prophet translated the record by divine revelation (a few mention \\nthe Urim and Thummim in connection with the translation) but do not offer \\nmore specific details. \\nThe successive migrations of the Latter-day Saints from Ohio to Missouri \\nand then to Illinois in the late 1830s halted work on the book of Abraham. \\nDuring this time, Joseph Smith expressed his desire to continue translating \\nthe Egyptian records but was unable to because of pressing church and civic \\nduties. He was finally able to prepare a publishable version of the book of \\nAbraham in early 1842. The text and three accompanying facsimiles first ap -\\npeared serially for a public readership in Nauvoo, Illinois, in the Times and \\nSeasons  between March 1 and May 16, 1842. Later that year, the text (and the \\nfirst facsimile) was republished in the Millennial Star  in England for British \\nLatter-day Saints under the editorial supervision of Apostle Parley P . Pratt. \\nNine years later, in 1851, the book of Abraham was included in the first edi -\\ntion of the Pearl of Great Price and has appeared in each subsequent edition \\nof the book.\\nAfter his death in 1844, Joseph Smith’s collection of papyri and mum -\\nmies transferred to various individuals (including his mother, Lucy Mack', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 51', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='The Book of Abraham   |   49 \\nSmith, and his widow Emma Hale Smith), with part of it eventually ending \\nup in the Wood’s Museum in Chicago, Illinois, in the mid-nineteenth centu -\\nry. This portion of the collection is presumed lost to the Great Chicago Fire \\nof 1871. Another portion of the collection, however, had found its way to \\nthe Metropolitan Museum of Art in New Y ork City. This quantity, including \\nthe original papyrus fragment of Facsimile 1, was returned to The Church of \\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in November 1967. Since then, the known \\nextant fragments of the Joseph Smith Papyri have remained in the custody of \\nthe Church in Salt Lake City, Utah.\\nAssociated with the translation of the book of Abraham is a collection \\nof manuscripts (a portion of one in the handwriting of Joseph Smith, but \\nmost in the handwriting of clerks such as Oliver Cowdery and William\\xa0W . \\nPhelps) sometimes called the Kirtland Egyptian Papers. The documents ap -\\npear to reflect mental effort on the part of their creators to interact with the \\ntext of the book of Abraham. Some of the papers also appear to show efforts \\nto decipher characters from the Egyptian papyri and created a systematized \\ngrammar of the Egyptian language. The exact nature of these documents—\\nincluding the extent of Joseph Smith’s involvement in their creation and their \\nrelationship to the English text of the book of Abraham—remains uncertain \\nas scholars continue to probe their meaning and significance. Although these \\ndocuments perhaps offer a glimpse into the mental efforts undertaken in \\nthe unfolding revelatory process in the production of the book of Abraham \\n(compare Doctrine and Covenants 9:8), to what extent the documents pos -\\nsess or were intended to convey any revealed truths is ultimately unknown. \\nThey were a collaborative work in progress and have never been formally ac -\\ncepted among Latter-day Saints as revealed knowledge or binding scripture.\\nThe surviving papyri fragments have been translated by both Latter-day \\nSaint and non-Latter-day Saint Egyptologists and do not contain any of the \\ntext of the book of Abraham. Instead, they contain copies of ancient Egyptian \\nfunerary texts known today as the Book of Breathings and the Book of Dead. \\nThe relationship between the revealed English text of the book of Abraham \\nand the papyri fragments is a matter of ongoing investigation, with different \\ntheories having been offered over the years to account for this incongruence. \\nWhile some have argued that the text of the book of Abraham was contained \\non a portion of papyri no longer extant, others have viewed the text as the \\nresult of the papyri catalyzing Joseph Smith’s revelatory insights on the life \\nand teachings of Abraham. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \\naccommodates either of these views and does not take an official position on \\nthe translation of the book of Abraham other than to say it was accomplished \\nby divine inspiration (something Joseph Smith and others who assisted him \\nin the translation of the text repeatedly affirmed).', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 52', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='50   |   The Book of Abraham\\nStructure\\nThe book of Abraham is narrated in an autobiographical voice that is \\nconsonant in tone and style with Joseph Smith’s other scriptural productions. \\nLike the Book of Mormon, it purports to be a historical narrative, although \\nit does contain poetic and literary elements such as parallelism and a brief \\nsoliloquy (Abraham 2:12–13). The text recounts scenes from the history \\nof the eponymous biblical patriarch and offers a personalized glimpse into \\nAbraham’s life as he flees his idolatrous kinsfolk in his homeland of Ur of the \\nChaldees, enters a covenant with God, and beholds a spectacular vision of \\nthe cosmos and Creation.\\nSome of the content in the book parallels passages from the book of Gen -\\nesis, most notably Genesis 12 (Abraham 2) and Genesis 1–2 (Abraham 4–5). \\nBut its opening act (chapter 1) and grand cosmology (chapter 3) have no \\nbiblical correlation. Unlike any other book of Latter-day Saint scripture, the \\nbook of Abraham is appended by three facsimiles which serve to visually \\nillustrate the text’s narrative (Facsimiles 1 and 3) and draw readers into its \\ncosmology (Facsimile 2). \\nThe text ends abruptly in the Garden of Eden with Adam naming the \\nnewly created animals. Textual elements (see 2:21) and Facsimile 3 suggest \\nthat the narrative was on track to have readers eventually witness Abraham \\nin Egypt instructing Pharaoh’s court in matters of astronomy (indeed, the \\nvery astronomy being annunciated in the text, as indicated at 3:15). Themes \\nof priesthood, covenants, sacrifice, obedience, and Abraham’s aptitude as a \\nseer run throughout the extant narrative, suggesting that these elements too \\nwould have been prominent in the remainder of the account. Unfortunately, \\ndespite the explicitly stated intentions of Joseph Smith, no additional sto -\\nry content was published beyond what is extant. Some sources suggest that \\ntextual material beyond what appears in the published book of Abraham \\nhad been translated by the Prophet, but no such putative material was made \\navailable in print before his death on June 27, 1844.  \\nPeppered throughout the text are clearly recognizable Hebrew words \\n(see, for example, 3:13, 16, 18) that are undoubtedly the result of Joseph \\nSmith’s study of Hebrew under the tutelage of Joshua Seixas in the early \\nmonths of 1836. Likewise, key phrases in the text’s Creation account are ren -\\ndered in ways that are more in harmony with the underlying Hebrew of the \\nKing James Version of Genesis 1–2 (for example, the choice of “expanse” over \\n“firmament” at 4:6). These and other clues from the extant manuscripts sug -\\ngest that the Prophet was actively and consciously involved in shaping the \\nEnglish translation of the book of Abraham and not merely a passive agent \\nreceiving and channeling a pre-rendered text.

Although other books of \\nLatter-day Saint scripture contain references to the concept of the pre-mor -\\ntality of humankind, it is Abraham’s vision recorded at 3:22–28 that captures \\nmost clearly a picture of the eternal identity of God’s children and their pur -\\npose here on earth. This cosmology is memorialized in the beloved hymn \\n“If Y ou Could Hie to Kolob, ” penned by William\\xa0W . Phelps, who scribed for \\nJoseph Smith during the text’s translation process. Drawing from the book \\nof Abraham’s description of the great star or planet nearest to the throne or \\nresidence of God (see 3:3–10), the hymn evokes contemplative reverence for \\nthe grandeur of eternity and the human soul’s yearning to progress back to its \\nFather’s presence, themes appropriately in harmony with Abraham’s account.\\nBesides offering a depiction of the pre-mortal council, the book of Abra -\\nham significantly augments how Latter-day Saints understand the Abraham -\\nic covenant. Elements missing in the Genesis account of Abraham’s covenant \\nwith God (Genesis 17) but preserved at Abraham 2:6–11 include the central \\nimportance of priesthood in the Abrahamic covenant and the culminating \\nblessings of eternal life. The book likewise expands how Latter-day Saints \\nconceive of Creation since the text departs in numerous ways from the con -\\nventional readings of the Creation account contained in Genesis 1:1–2:4. For \\nexample, the book of Abraham refashions the “days” of Creation into “times, ” \\nemphasizing the (apparently lengthy) periods of unfolding preparation in the \\nprocess of the earth’s creation (Abraham 4:1–5:3). The text likewise explicit -\\nly mentions the participation of multiple gods counselling together as they \\nundertook Creation (4:1), a detail hinted at in the Genesis account (Genesis \\n1:26–27) but prominently narrated in the book of Abraham (for example, \\n4:26–27; 5:2–3). \\nThe book of Abraham’s portrait of the ancient world of the patriarch’s day \\nand its expansive cosmology have piqued the curiosity of generations of Lat -\\nter-day Saint writers who have sought ways to make sense of this sometimes \\nperplexing text. While much about the book of Abraham remains elusive—\\nnot the least being the precise relationship the translated text shares with \\nthe papyri scrolls obtained by the Prophet Joseph Smith—scholars have been \\nable to piece together a plausible ancient context and setting for the book \\nthat makes it much more comprehensible and enriching.

The writings of Abraham . The heading as published in the T&S  describes the text as “pur -\\nporting to be the writings of Abraham. ” The phrase “purporting to be” was dropped in the \\n1878 edition of the Pearl of Great Price. This should not be taken to mean Joseph Smith or \\nthose who assisted him in the translation of the book of Abraham doubted or questioned the \\nauthenticity of the text. Rather, “purport” in the Prophet’s day merely meant “to mean, to sig -\\nnify. ” By his own hand . The idiom “by the hand”  is attested as an ancient Egyptian idiom to \\ndenote authorship and agency. It also appears in the Hebrew Bible (see, for example, Haggai \\n1:1; 2:1; Zechariah 7:7, 12; Malachi 1:1) to denote the prophetic agent issuing the word of the \\nLord (compare 1 Corinthians 16:21; Galatians 6:11; Colossians 4:18; 2 Thessalonians 3:17; \\nPhilemon 1:19). The phrase “written by his own hand, upon papyrus, ” accordingly need only \\nbe taken here as attributing authorship of the text to Abraham, not necessarily as a declaration \\nthat Abraham physically wrote the papyrus manuscripts acquired by Joseph Smith. Ab1 be -\\ngins: “Translation of the Book of Abraham written\\xa0 by his own hand upon papyrus and \\nfound\\xa0in the CataCombs of Egypt s.”  1\\xa0The opening chapter of the book of Abraham narrates \\nthe patriarch’s life in Ur of the Chaldees, focusing on his escape from the clutches of his mur -\\nderous kinsmen. It contains much unique material that is not paralleled in the sparse biblical \\naccount of the early life of Abraham (see Genesis 11:27–32). 1:1\\xa0In the land of the Chaldeans. \\nThe narrative in the published text of the book of Abraham takes place in the land of the Chal -\\ndeans (Ur), Haran, and then Canaan. Abraham never actually sets foot in Egypt in the extant \\ntext, although from Abraham 2:21 and Facsimile 3 it is clear this is where the narrative was \\nleading. Although Joseph Smith intended to translate and publish more text, he unfortunately \\ndid not accomplish that before his death. The location of Abraham’s Ur of the Chaldees (see \\nAbraham 1:20; 2:1–4; compare Genesis 11:27–32) is disputed. The most popular candidate for \\nAbraham’s Ur is Tell el-Muqayyar in southern Iraq. However, various sites in modern Syria \\nand Turkey have also been proposed. I, Abraham .

The names \\nElkenah and Libnah are given as Elkkener or Elkeenah and Zibnah in the Kirtland-era manu -\\nscripts (as at Abraham 1:13, 17, 20, 29), while the name of the god Korash is either omitted or \\nrendered here as Koash in Ab4. The name Elkenah is attested in Northwest Semitic and Ana -\\ntolian inscriptions as Elkurni ša. It appears as a male personal name in the King James Version \\nof the Old Testament (see Exodus 6:24; 1 Samuel 1:1, 4, 8, 19, 21, 23), but not as a deity’s name. \\nIt is a shortened version of an epithet meaning “God, creator of earth” ( ʾēl qônēh ʾāreṣ).

Although the offering \\nof human life to the idolatrous gods was done “after the manner of the Egyptians, ” it was said \\nto be done in the land of Chaldea. The modern terminology of “human sacrifice” does not \\nappear in the text. Only once is this practice called “the sacrifice of the heathen”  (1:7). Other -\\nwise, it is called an “offering” or “thank-offering” (1:9–10). The extent to which peoples of the \\nancient Near East practiced what is sometimes today called “human sacrifice” remains debat -\\ned. Ritual or sacred violence is attested among the Egyptians of Abraham’s day in the form of \\nexecration rituals in which enemies and other threats to Egypt were ritually destroyed. These \\nrituals were mainly carried out on effigies but in at least one documented case on an actual \\nhuman victim. Trespassers of sacred space, rebels against the king, and desecrators of tombs \\nwere also deemed worthy of capital punishment by the ancient Egyptians. Egyptian presence in \\nthe land of Chaldea . The text mentions a “priest of Pharaoh” conducting these sacrifices “after \\nthe manner of the Egyptians”  (1:10–11), suggesting some level of awareness of Egyptian cul -\\nture and religion in Abraham’s homeland. (But note that the ethnic origin of this priest is not \\ngiven, only that he served the god Pharaoh mentioned in the text.) Based on the current ar -\\nchaeological record, this detail converges much better with a setting for Abraham’s Ur in mod -\\nern Syria or Turkey than with the site of Tell el-Muqayyar in southern Iraq. 1:9\\xa0The god of \\nShagreel .

The structure of the covenantal pattern evolved over \\ntime, but typically featured a solemn oath or ceremony, a preamble, a historical prologue, \\nnamed witnesses to the covenant, stipulations, promised blessings for keeping the covenant, \\nand promised curses for breaking the covenant. The covenant Abraham enters with God here \\nfeatures several of these elements, including a solemn ceremony (Abraham 2:6), a preamble \\n(2:6–8), stipulations (2:9–10), and blessings and curses (2:11).

Here Kolob is mentioned for the first time. \\nIn the text it is said to be a star or planet; a “great [star/planet]” and a “governing one”; “nigh \\nunto the throne of God”; used to tell relative time (Abraham 3:4); and a signifier of “first cre -\\nation” (Facsimile 2, fig. 1). The name arguably derives from the reconstructed Afroasiatic root \\n*ḳlb/ḳrb , meaning “interior, inside, middle. ” Descendent cognates that likely relate to Kolob \\nare attested in Egyptian ( ḳꜢb; “interior, midst”), Akkadian ( qerbum ; “inside”), and Hebrew \\n(qereb ; “inside, middle”). Alternatively, the name Kolob might derive from the Semitic root \\nklb, meaning “dog” (as in the Akkadian kalbu  or Hebrew keleb ), and might thereby be identi -\\nfiable with the dog-star Sirius, which held especially significant calendrical and religious sig -\\nnificance for the ancient Egyptians. The converging characteristics between Kolob and Sirius \\nare compelling (for example, Sirius was recognized as a great star by the ancients, served an \\nimportant calendrical and timekeeping purpose, was depicted as being a ruling star, and so \\non) but this identification remains unconfirmed. Near unto God . An important theme in this \\nchapter is the relative proximity of graded stars to God’s celestial residence. Kolob is repeated -\\nly said to be nearest to the throne of God (here and at 3:9–10, 16), thus making it the greatest \\nof the governing astronomical bodies. If Kolob does indeed derive from the root *ḳlb/ḳrb,  \\nthen this emphasis on its nearness and proximity to God would work well as a pun on the \\nname. 3:5–10 \\xa0Geocentric cosmology .

A Leitmotif  running through this chapter is a depiction of Abraham as a seer: \\nAbraham sees or is otherwise shown  celestial bodies, spirits (or intelligences), God Himself, \\nand the premortal council (Abraham 3:2, 6, 11–12, 15–16, 21–22).

The imagery of stars/\\nspirits in Abraham’s vision plays nicely on mythological and cosmic symbolism already prev -\\nalent among the ancient Egyptians. Gnolaum, or eternal . The word is clearly recognizable as \\nthe Hebrew word for “everlasting, eternal” ( ʿolam ). In Genesis 21:33 Abraham plants a tama -\\nrisk tree at Beer-Sheba and dedicates it to “the everlasting God” ( ʾel ʿolam ). The eternity of \\nspirit or intelligence was a teaching the Prophet Joseph Smith emphasized in the final years of \\nhis ministry, including in his now-famous King Follett Sermon of April 7, 1844. 3:22–23 \\xa0Abra -\\nham is shown the premortal intelligences that were “organized” into the premortal divine \\ncouncil. These intelligences or spirits are described as “noble and great ones” and are decreed \\nby God to become “rulers” in mortality because they are good. Abraham is identified as one of \\nthese noble and great spirits. This evokes depictions of the divine council of God and His at -\\ntending divine beings (called, variously, gods, the sons of god[s], angels, holy ones, and so on) \\nin the Hebrew Bible and other ancient Near Eastern texts. Furthermore, it subtly plays on (and \\nsubverts) ideas in ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian religion that kings were divinely fore -\\nordained by the gods to be rulers. Instead, Abraham’s vision reveals that he and other righ -\\nteous spirits were foreordained by the Lord to be rulers.

Unlike traditional Jewish and Christian teaching, the text at Abraham 3:24 \\naffirms creation from preexisting matter, not creation ex nihilo , or from nothing. In creation \\nmyths from Abraham’s day, Creation was often envisioned as an act of divine fashioning of \\nchaotic elements (typically a primordial cosmic ocean). This, indeed, is how Genesis 1:1–3 \\nenvisions Creation. The purpose of mortality . At Abraham 3:25 an important purpose is given \\nfor why the earth was created and populated with the premortal spirits: to see if they would \\nobey the commands of the Lord God, the supreme intelligence. From other scripture, it is clear \\nthat this test of obedience is part of the Lord’s work to bring to pass the immortality and eter -\\nnal life of humankind (see Moses 1:39). The first estate . The language of Abraham 3:26 is ap -\\npropriated from Jude 1:6, which speaks of angels who did not keep their “first estate” (more \\nliterally, their “own position [of authority]”; eautou archē ) but instead were destined for dam -\\nnation. The point made in the text here is that those intelligences who excelled in their “first \\nestate” (premortal, disembodied state) by adhering to the Lord’s commandments would have \\n“glory” (eternal life and exaltation) added upon them if they successfully traversed their “sec -\\nond estate” (probationary mortality). It is, in effect, a concise formulation of the plan of salva -\\ntion. The Son of Man . In biblical Hebrew, the phrase “son of man” ( ben ʾadam ) connotes “mor -\\ntal, human. ” It is used prominently in the book of Ezekiel when God addresses the prophet and \\nalso in Moses 1:12 when Satan denigrates Moses. In later apocalyptic works, most notably \\nDaniel (especially 7:13–14), the Son of Man (Aramaic: bar ʾenash ) is an eschatological figure \\nwho assumes rulership over the earth at the end of days. Believed by His disciples to be this \\nvery eschatological figure (compare Revelation 1:13), Jesus is identified as the Son of Man in \\nnumerous instances throughout the canonical Gospels. In the book of Moses (6:57; 7:35), one \\nof the Adamic names for God the Father is revealed to be Man of Holiness. The identity of the \\npremortal Jesus as “one like unto the Son of Man” at Abraham 3:27 might be understood si -\\nmultaneously in these contexts: He is the Firstborn of the Man of Holiness (compare Doctrine \\nand Covenants 78:20; 93:21–22; 95:17), one who condescended to become a mortal (compare \\n1 Nephi 11:14–36), and the foreordained millennial King (compare Revelation 19:15–16). The \\nfall of Lucifer . At 3:27–28 the fall of Lucifer is briefly narrated (compare Moses 4:1–4; 2\\xa0Nephi \\n2:17–18). Upset that he was not selected to be the Father’s redemptive emissary, Lucifer (here \\nleft unnamed, merely identified as “another” or “the second”) becomes angry and draws many \\nof the premortal intelligences away with him.

And \\ndarkness reigned upon the face of the \\ndeep, and the Spirit of the Gods was \\nbrooding upon the face of the waters.\\n4\\xa0The book of Abraham’s account of the Creation significantly impacts how Latter-day Saints \\nunderstand this important theological subject. The more noteworthy elements introduced by \\nthe book of Abraham include creation by organizing preexisting matter, multiple Gods (the \\ndivine council) participating in the process, and the seeming fact that the periods (“days”) of \\nCreation were less temporally definite. The Creation account here directly follows the divine \\ncouncil scene of Abraham 3:24–28 and should indeed be read as the narrative continuation \\nof that scene. The modern chapter divisions for the text were introduced in 1902 by James\\xa0E. \\nTalmage. As it appeared in the T&S  under the editorship of Joseph Smith and as it appeared \\nin the 1851 first edition of the Pearl of Great Price, there was no chapter division between 3:28 \\nand 4:1. Read as one continuous narrative, the divine council decides on a course of action \\nin 3:24–28 and then executes that decision beginning here. (See further the commentary for \\nMoses 2.) 4:1\\xa0Let us go down . The cohortative language here clearly parallels Genesis 1:26; \\n11:7. As so used both here and in Genesis, it signals the execution of group action. In the bib -\\nlical Creation narrative of Genesis 1, God does not enlist the effort of the divine council until \\nthe creation of humankind. Here, however, and in the book of Moses (2:1), the divine council \\nparticipates in Creation from the earliest steps. The Gods.  As with the glosses earlier in the \\ntext (at, for example, Abraham 1:7, 9, 12, 14, 20, 23; 2:11), it is not clear if these explanatory \\ncomments were original to Abraham or introduced by Joseph Smith or his scribes. In either \\ncase, the text departs from the Genesis account by explicitly introducing multiple divinities \\nas being involved in the creative process. Organized and formed . The text explicitly rejects no -\\ntions of creation ex nihilo by employing the verbs “organize” and “form” throughout. Although \\ndeparting from traditional Jewish and Christian ideas of Creation, this absence of creation \\nex nihilo grounds the book of Abraham more comfortably in the milieu of the ancient Near \\nEast during Abraham’s day. It also more closely aligns the text with the underlying Hebrew of \\nGenesis 1. This may likely be, in part, the result of Joseph Smith’s study of Hebrew under the \\ntutelage of Joshua Seixas in Kirtland, Ohio, in the early months of 1836. As with the Hebrew \\nterminology that appears in the text (see, for example, Abraham 3:13, 16, 18) and the explana -\\ntions to the facsimiles (see, for example, Facsimile 1, fig. 12; Facsimile 2, figs. 4–5), it appears \\nthat the Prophet’s rendering of this Creation account was influenced by his knowledge of He -\\nbrew. It remains uncertain to what extent his secular learning helped shape the articulation \\nof this revelation—or, conversely, to what extent the revelation itself, as tailored by a divine \\ninfluence, was adapted for or integrated with Joseph Smith’s growing knowledge of ancient \\nlanguages. 4:2\\xa0The formation of the earth .

In an unpublished editorial dated March 1, 1842, Joseph Smith \\nsignaled his intention to “contin[u]e to translate\\xa0& publish [the rest of the book of Abraham] \\nas fast as possible till the whole is completed. ” Eleven months later, John Taylor, acting as \\neditor of the  T&S , published a notice in the paper that the Prophet “promise[d] .\\xa0.\\xa0. to furnish \\nus with further extracts from the Book of Abraham. ” Joseph’s death on June 27, 1844, put an \\nend to the translation and publication of any additional material from the book of Abraham. \\n5:1\\xa0The chapter begins with a direct quotation from the gods without the customary quotation \\nformula (“ And the Gods said .\\xa0.\\xa0. ”) that is found throughout the previous chapter. This oddity \\nmight be explained as either a scribal error in the transmission of the book of Abraham or a \\ntypographical error on the part of the printers of the T&S . There is no extant manuscript for \\nany text beyond 3:26, however, so this hypothesis is impossible to prove. 5:2–3 \\xa0Once again \\nthe verb “counsel” is used to indicate the deliberateness behind the gods’ activity. The “time \\nthat they counseled among themselves to form the heavens and the earth” appears to refer \\nto the council scene in 3:24–26, thereby reinforcing the narrative continuity of the text and \\nmaking the presence of the divine council in this text unambiguous. 5:4\\xa0As with Genesis 2:4 \\nand Moses 3:4, this verse marks the commencement of a second Creation account. See the \\ncommentary at Moses 3:4. 5:7\\xa0Another gloss explains that the human’s spirit as well as the \\nbreath of life (compare Genesis 2:7; Moses 3:7) is what constitutes a living soul (compare', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 79', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='The Book of Abraham   |   77 \\na man to till the ground. 6\\xa0But there \\nwent up a mist from the earth, and \\nwatered the whole face of the ground.\\nThe Gods Form a Man and \\nPlant a Garden\\n7\\xa0And the Gods formed man from \\nthe dust of the ground, and took his \\nspirit (that is, the man’s spirit), and \\nput it into him, and breathed into \\nhis nostrils the breath of life, and \\nman became a living soul. 8\\xa0And the \\nGods planted a garden, eastward in \\nEden, and there they put the man, \\nwhose spirit they had put into the \\nbody which they had formed. 9\\xa0And \\nout of the ground made the Gods to \\ngrow every tree that is pleasant to the \\nsight and good for food; the tree of \\nlife, also, in the midst of the garden, \\nand the tree of knowledge of good \\nand evil. 10\\xa0There was a river running \\nout of Eden, to water the garden, and \\nfrom thence it was parted and be -\\ncame into four heads.  \\nThe Gods Place the Man in \\nthe Garden\\n11\\xa0And the Gods took the man and \\nput him in the Garden of Eden, to \\ndress it and to keep it. 12\\xa0And the Gods commanded the man, saying, \\n“Of every tree of the garden thou \\nmayest freely eat, 13\\xa0but of the tree \\nof knowledge of good and evil, thou \\nshalt not eat of it.

The omission is likely deliberate, but the \\nreason for such is not clear. 5:11 \\xa0Adam’s responsibility to dress and keep the garden parallels \\nhumanity’s dominion over the animals. Both cases include an implicit sense of responsibility \\nto preserve and protect Creation. 5:13 \\xa0Here the gloss is clearly coming from Abraham and ex -\\nplains that Adam was not yet aware of the fact that the gods had appointed celestial objects to \\nbe used for keeping time. As such, the only point of temporal reckoning available to Adam was \\nKolob (having just come down from the premortal council adjacent thereto).

As told in Genesis \\n2, the reason the woman was created was because none of the animals named by Adam were \\nfound to be suitable partners, hence reinforcing the ontological distinction between human \\nand beast. Here the text significantly rearranges the order of events, placing the naming of the \\nanimals after the creation of the woman. The logic here seems to be that the creation of woman \\nwas not some afterthought or accident but took preeminence. The text does not hint that the \\nwoman was only created after the other animals were seen as incompatible partners for Adam, \\nas it is in the biblical account.

Often rendered as \\n“soul” (or left untranslated), the Ba essentially constituted the nonmaterial \\nessence of an individual (their personality, character, reputation, their “self, ” \\nand so on). Gods also had a Ba that could be detected in any phenomenon \\nor action, which demonstrated the given deity’s presence or essence. The Ba \\ncould freely come and go after death and could even be sent and commanded \\nto perform certain tasks (such as deliver messages or appear in dreams) if \\nproperly ordered. For this last reason, it seems, in the Greco-Roman period \\nthe Ba was sometimes rendered in Greek as “assistant, attendant” ( paredros ) \\nand was conceptualized in parallel function with “messengers” ( angeloi ). \\nThis figure corresponds to the “angel of [the Lord’s] presence” described at \\nAbraham 1:15; 2:12, who rescues the patriarch from death.\\nFigure 2 .

The first two interpretations of \\nthis gesture would accord well with the narrative in Abraham 1:12–15.

The idolatrous priest of Elkenah attempting to offer \\nup Abraham as a sacrifice. \\nThis figure has been interpreted among Egyptologists as \\neither the god Anubis or a priest preparing the deceased \\nfor embalming and burial. As preserved today, there is a \\nlacuna where the figure’s head would be. There appear to \\nbe traces of a headdress over the figure’s right shoulder that \\nindicate, in all likelihood, that the figure originally had \\nthe head of a jackal.

The figure’s left arm \\nis extended over fig. 2, but the hand is missing in a lacuna. Eyewitnesses to \\nthe papyrus from the nineteenth century described this figure as wielding a \\nknife, as depicted in the printed facsimile. The crescent shape of the knife in \\nthe facsimile would be consistent with the shape of flint knives used in an -\\ncient Egypt in ritual slaughter and execration rites.

The name derives from Greek ( hypo tēn kephalēn ) and means \\nliterally “under the head” (corresponding to the Egyptian ẖr tp ). The hypo -\\ncephalus was a specialized funerary amulet that was placed under (or some -\\ntimes just near) the head of the deceased and served to protect the deceased \\nin the afterlife, provide light and heat for the deceased, and to transform the \\ndeceased into a resurrected divine being. Hypocephali also served as astro -\\nnomical documents, functioning as a type of guide through the cosmos for \\nthe deceased. The hypocephalus that served as the basis for Facsimile 2 was \\nowned anciently by a man named Sheshonq, whose name appears in fig. 8, \\nand most likely dates to the Ptolemaic period.\\nFigure 1.

One day in Kolob is equal to a thousand \\nyears according to the measurement of this earth, \\nwhich is called by the Egyptians Jah-oh-eh.\\nKolob features prominently in the cosmology of the book of Abraham as a \\nstar or planet nearest to the residence of God (see Abraham 3:3–10). As with \\nthe explanation to this figure, Kolob in the text of the book of Abraham is \\nsaid to have timekeeping significance (Abraham 3:9). The comment that ce -\\nlestial time “signifies one day to a cubit” is perplexing, but perhaps is meant \\nto describe angular velocity, or the speed at which an object revolves relative \\nto another object (in this case the orbits of celestial bodies). According to \\nthis understanding, the movement of Kolob (assuming it is intended to be \\na physical star in the visible night sky; see the commentary accompanying \\nAbraham 3:3) is being measured in cubits, an anciently attested phenome -\\nnon for other celestial bodies. In its Egyptian context this figure is commonly \\nidentified in other hypocephali as the god Amun (or Amun-Re), a supreme -\\nly important deity in ancient Egypt as the primeval, self-generating creator \\ngod whose name means “hidden one” ( ỉmn).

After rehearsing this material—consisting of \\nJesus’s prophecy of the destruction of the Jerusalem temple, the scattering \\nof the Jews, and the signs of His return as the glorified Son of Man—the \\nLord instructed the Prophet to commence translating the New Testament as \\npart of his inspired revision of the Bible (now called the Joseph Smith Trans -\\nlation) that he had begun that previous summer (45:60–61). With Sidney \\nRigdon as his scribe, Joseph began producing his “Translation of the New \\nTestament translated by the power of God” (so designated in the head to the \\noriginal manuscript) the next day, March 8, 1831, leaving off where he had \\nreached in his revision of the Old Testament (Genesis 24:41).\\nIt is not known precisely when Joseph Smith reached Matthew 24 in this \\n“new translation” of the Bible (as he himself called it), but it certainly would \\nnot have been much longer after he began revising the New Testament on \\nMarch 8. As with his translation of the opening chapters of Genesis that is \\nnow canonized as the book of Moses, the Prophet originally dictated his re -\\nvision of Matthew 24 to Sidney Rigdon, who captured the dictation in what is \\nnow commonly designated New Testament Manuscript 1 (NT1, which cov -\\ners Matthew 1:1–26:71). Shortly after this initial translation work, on April 4, \\n1831, Church historian and recorder John Whitmer began producing a copy', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 100', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='98   |   Joseph Smith—Matthew\\nof this manuscript that served as the working draft for the rest of the revision \\nof the New Testament. This manuscript, commonly designated New Testa -\\nment Manuscript 2 (NT2), underwent additional revisions as the Prophet \\nrefined the project, including the material that had been previously produced \\nwith Rigdon in NT1.\\nAs with his translation of the content in the book of Genesis that is now \\nthe book of Moses, early Latter-day Saints quickly recognized the signifi -\\ncance of the Prophet’s revision to Matthew 24. In the mid-1830s, what is \\nnow designated Joseph Smith—Matthew appeared in print and circulated in \\nthe form of a standalone “broadside” (a handbill), which was subsequently \\nrecopied in other contemporary publications such as John Corrill’s 1839 A \\nBrief History of the Church of Christ of Latter Day Saints  and the first edition \\nof the Pearl of Great Price, prepared by Elder Franklin\\xa0D. Richards in 1851. \\nThere it appeared as “ An Extract from a Translation of the Bible” alongside \\nthe extracted material from Joseph Smith’s revision of Genesis (also circu -\\nlating in print during the Prophet’s lifetime), and it has appeared in each \\nsubsequent edition of the Pearl of Great Price.\\nStructure\\nAlthough Joseph Smith—Matthew is commonly referred to as a translation \\nor revision of Matthew 24, it in fact begins at Matthew 23:39 with a brief \\nnarrative that frames the discourse. Following the Gospel of Matthew, Jo -\\nseph Smith—Matthew narrates Jesus finishing His lamentations over Jeru -\\nsalem, leaving the city and crossing the Kidron valley, and delivering the \\ndiscourse on the Mount of Olives (see, respectively, Matthew 23:37–39 and \\nJoseph Smith—Matthew 1:1; Matthew 24:1–2 and Joseph Smith—Matthew \\n1:2; Matthew 24:3 and Joseph Smith—Matthew 1:4). As also with Matthew, \\nJoseph Smith—Matthew presents this discourse as a response to the disci -\\nples’ inquiring of Jesus concerning the signs of His coming (Matthew 24:3; \\nJoseph Smith—Matthew 1:4).\\nOne of the most pronounced revisions Joseph Smith—Matthew makes \\non the biblical version of this discourse is to more clearly present Jesus as \\naddressing two separate, consecutive events: (1) the destruction of Jerusalem \\nand its temple and the scattering of the Jews; (2) His return as the triumphant \\nSon of Man. The pivot appears at around Joseph Smith—Matthew 1:21, al -\\nthough it is still not entirely clear where to precisely demarcate when Jesus \\nis prophesying events in the first century AD and when He is prophesying \\nevents related to His Second Coming. Blurring this even more is the repe -\\ntition of some events or themes in both timelines, such as the desecrating \\nsacrilege (the “abomination of desolation” mentioned at 1:12, 32), or the rise \\nof false Christs (1:6, 22), or the spread of iniquity (1:10, 30). Nevertheless, \\nit is clear from other passages such as 1:34 that some events in the biblical', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 101', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Joseph Smith—Matthew   |   99 \\naccount that appear as expected to unfold in the first century in fact are yet \\nto be fulfilled (see Matthew 24:34).\\nJesus employs four parables in this discourse to illustrate the principles \\nHe wishes to impress upon His disciples. The first, the parable of the car -\\ncass and eagles (or vultures) at Joseph Smith—Matthew 1:27, concerns the \\ngathering of the elect. The second, the parable of the fig tree at 1:38–39, em -\\nphasizes the need to be watchful for the signs of Jesus’s return. The third, \\nthe parable of the thief in the night at 1:47–48, warns that the disciples must \\never be on their guard lest they be caught unprepared at their Lord’s return. \\nThe fourth and final parable (at 1:49–55) provides contrasting portraits of \\ngood and evil servants and their respective rewards at the Lord’s coming. In \\neach case the parable is followed by additional instruction that develops the \\nrespective intent. Quotations of or allusions to texts from the Hebrew Bible \\nare also peppered throughout this discourse, reinforcing the prophetic impli -\\ncations of these passages. \\n Significance for Latter-day Saints\\nThe Latter-day Saint concern for eschatology, or the theology of the last days \\nand the final destiny of humanity, arose early in the restored Church of Jesus \\nChrist. Several of Joseph Smith’s canonized revelations in the Doctrine and \\nCovenants (for example, sections 1, 29, 43, 45, 84) elaborate on the signs and \\nevents leading up to the return of Jesus Christ to the earth, the Millenni -\\num, and related doctrines. The millenarian worldview of the early Saints was \\ngreatly informed both by the Prophet’s revelations and also by his revising of \\nbiblical prophecies, including those recorded in Matthew 24.  \\nAlthough the Lord’s warnings to His disciples in the Olivet Discourse are \\ngrave, their intention is not to frighten but rather to inform and, ultimately, \\nencourage. The promise extended to faithful, watchful Saints in the last days \\nis that their diligence and precaution will be rewarded with their joining the \\nLord at His coming and their triumph over the wicked (see Joseph Smith—\\nMatthew 1:37, 55). Read in this light, Joseph Smith’s revisions to the Olivet \\nDiscourse ultimately reaffirm the relevance of the Lord’s promises to His an -\\ncient disciples and to modern Saints: that once the earth finds its millennial \\nrest, He “shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he will \\nbe their king and their lawgiver” (Doctrine and Covenants 45:59).\\nSelected Bibliography\\nAnderson, Richard L. “Joseph Smith’s Insights into the Olivet Prophecy: \\nJoseph Smith and Matthew 24. ” In \\xa0Pearl of Great Price Symposium: \\nA Centennial Presentation (22 November 1975) , 48–61.

It refers to a pollutant that sacrileg -\\nes the holiness of the temple, leaving it desolate. The desecration of the Jerusalem temple by \\nAntiochus IV Epiphanes during the Maccabean Revolt of 167–160 BC, wherein he erected an \\nimage of Zeus in the temple, is often linked to this prophecy in the book of Daniel (compare \\n1\\xa0Maccabees 1:54). Jesus uses this imagery from Daniel as a type for both the imminent deso -\\nlation of Jerusalem (and with it, Herod’s temple), as well as the desolating sacrileges preceding \\nHis Second Coming (Joseph Smith—Matthew 1:32). The disciples are admonished to stand in \\nholy places when they encounter such sacrilege. 1:13–17\\xa0 To escape the foretold calamities, \\nJesus warns His disciples to be prepared to flee at a moment’s notice. The instruction to flee \\ninto the mountains went against conventional ancient thinking, which prompted people \\nduring a siege or prolonged warfare to secure themselves in walled cities (such as Jerusalem) \\nfor better protection. With this, Jesus warns that the disciples will not find safety in manmade \\nartifices. Those with vulnerable family members such as children will find their situation ex -\\nacerbated since hunger and famine frequently follow disruptive events like those described \\nhere. Likewise, those forced to flee during the rainy winter, when travel is difficult, or the \\nsabbath, when travel is forbidden, will likewise be at a great disadvantage. 1:18–20\\xa0 The tribu -\\nlations of the Jews following the disastrous outcome of the Jewish Revolt are described in', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 105', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Joseph Smith—Matthew   |   103 \\nA Warning of False Christs\\n21 “Behold, these things I have spo -\\nken unto you concerning the Jews. \\nAnd again, after the tribulation of \\nthose days which shall come upon \\nJerusalem, if any man shall say unto \\nyou, ‘Lo, here is Christ, or there, ’ be -\\nlieve him not. 22\\xa0For in those days \\nthere shall also arise false Christs, \\nand false prophets, and shall show \\ngreat signs and wonders, insomuch, \\nthat, if possible, they shall deceive \\nthe very elect, who are the elect ac -\\ncording to the covenant. 23\\xa0Behold, I \\nspeak these things unto you for the \\nelect’s sake.

Here He pivots into a description of \\nfuture signs that will precede His glorious return, beginning in 1:22–26 with a description of \\nfalse Christs that will arise in the vacuum left by the destruction of the temple and, more \\nbroadly, in the Great Apostasy. Lo here, lo there. Compare Joseph Smith—History 1:5. 1:25–\\n26\\xa0Jesus promises that His return will be accompanied by great glory that will cover the earth. \\nThose who claim to be Christ but insist on secreting themselves away into small factions are \\nto be dismissed as false Christs. 1:27\\xa0 The first of four parables illustrating the principles of \\nJesus’s discourse commences with this verse.

True to \\nHis hyperbolic didactic method (see Matthew 5:29–30), Jesus uses this vivid imagery to great \\neffect in this parable describing the gathering of the elect in the last days.

This early catalyst for the Latter-day Saints’ historical enterprise result -\\ned in the composition and publication of several histories of varying intent \\nand scope during the Prophet Joseph Smith’s lifetime. Each of these histories \\n(including the Prophet’s unpublished 1832 personal history and the published \\n1842 “Church History” editorial) preserve important reports of Joseph’s ad -\\nolescence, the inaugural events of the Restoration, and the early years of the \\nChurch. But it is the history begun in the spring of 1838 and resumed in the \\nsummer of 1839 that has arguably had the most significant impact on the \\nhistorical consciousness of the Latter-day Saints. This history, often referred \\nto simply as the 1838 history and presented to the world as the “History of \\nJoseph Smith, ” stands out among the Prophet’s other projects to chronicle his \\nlife if for no other reason than it is the only such project to enjoy canonical \\nstatus within the Church. \\nThe 1838 history was begun in late April of that same year after Joseph \\nSmith and the main body of the Saints had relocated from Kirtland, Ohio, \\nto Far West, Missouri. As recorded in an April 27, 1838, journal entry, the \\nProphet on that day began “writing a history of this Church\\xa0from the earliest \\nperiod\\xa0of its existence” with the assistance of Sidney Rigdon and George\\xa0W . \\nRobinson acting as scribe. Unfortunately, there are no known extant manu -\\nscripts of this initial undertaking. The earliest surviving manuscript copies of \\nthe 1838 history are two drafts composed by scribe James Mulholland, who \\nbegan work as one of Joseph’s clerks in September 1838. Because the original \\nmanuscript composed in early 1838 is not available, it is impossible to know', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 110', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='108   |   Joseph Smith—History\\nwith absolute certainty the relationship between it and Mulholland’s copies \\nprepared in the spring and summer of 1839 after the forced relocation of the \\nSaints from Missouri to Illinois and the Prophet’s imprisonment in Liberty \\nJail. It seems probable, however, that Mulholland’s drafts prepared in 1839 are \\na continuation or otherwise faithful copy (with perhaps some revision) of the \\nhistory began that previous year. After Mulholland’s death in November 1839, \\nsupervision of the history fell into the hands of clerks including Robert B. \\nThompson, William W . Phelps, and Willard Richards, who continued to com -\\npose material and make revisions to the history during the Prophet’s lifetime.  \\nThe 1838 history first appeared in print in the spring of 1842. The first \\nportion of the history appeared in the March 15, 1842, issue of the Times \\nand Seasons , the same issue that saw, among other things, the publication \\nof the second installment of the book of Abraham (Abraham 2:19–5:21 and \\nFacsimile 2). The history would continue to be published serially in the Times \\nand Seasons  until the Saints’ exodus from Illinois in 1846, and by the time \\nof the Prophet’s death on June 27, 1844, the Times and Seasons  had reached \\nDecember 1831 in the history’s narrative. Upon their settlement in Utah, the \\nSaints resumed publishing the history from 1851–1858 in serial installments \\nin the Deseret News .\\nMeanwhile, across the Atlantic in Great Britain, the Church’s newspaper \\nThe Latter Day Saints’ Millennial Star  had begun republishing the “History of \\nJoseph Smith” as early as June 1842, initially under the editorship of Apostle \\nParley\\xa0 P . Pratt. This series (a reprinting of the Times and Seasons ’ install -\\nments) would run until 1845 and then pick up again between 1852–1863 by \\nreprinting the Deseret News ’ run of the series. This web of publications and \\nrepublications would eventually be stabilized in B.\\xa0H.

Richards prepared his 1851 first edition of the \\nPearl of Great Price, he included, with some revision, the early installments \\nof the series as “Extracts from the History of Joseph Smith. ” Unlike some of \\nthe other material in succeeding editions, the “Extracts from the History of \\nJoseph Smith” (now Joseph Smith—History) has remained a mainstay of this \\nbook of scripture, having been retained in each of the major editions and \\nundergoing comparatively minimal revision. \\nAs Latter-day Saint historical consciousness has expanded with the work \\nof the Joseph Smith Papers Project and other scholarly enterprises, apprecia -\\ntion for the 1838 history has not waned.

Still, until such a time when, if ever, any of these other histories are \\naccepted into the canon, Joseph Smith’s 1838 history will remain the preem -\\ninent retelling of his early life and prophetic calling. \\nStructure\\nAs would be expected, Joseph Smith—History is told in the Prophet’s auto -\\nbiographical voice. It is entirely a prose narrative that is recounted, with the \\nexception of one small portion (Joseph Smith—History 1:64–65), from the \\nProphet’s own perspective. Although it seeks to “put all inquirers after truth \\nin possession of the facts” (1:1), the history is far from a neutral, dispassionate \\nchronicling of the events it describes. The composition of the history began \\nbetween the bitter apostasies of Kirtland in 1837 and the mounting tensions \\nin Missouri that would explode in late 1838 as the Missouri Mormon War. It \\nwas in this hostile, polemical environment that the Prophet opens his history \\nby decrying the “reports which have been put in circulation by evil-disposed \\nand designing persons” who wished “to militate against its character as a \\nChurch and its progress in the world. ” Indeed, feeling “induced” to go on \\nthe record, the Prophet’s stated intention with the history was to “disabuse \\nthe public mind” that was being excited against the Latter-day Saints with \\nscurrilous claims coming from a less-than-sympathetic national press. This \\nundoubtedly accounts for the defiant tone that runs throughout the history, \\nthe negative portrayal of those who opposed Joseph (whose actions are rou -\\ntinely described as “persecution” and “mobbing”), and the sense of persecu -\\ntion young Joseph felt in response to his visionary experiences that frames \\nthe opening and closing verses of the canonical text (1:21–26, 61, 74–75).\\nThe canonical 1838 history draws partially from extant records, which \\nit embeds into the narrative. This is seen most clearly with the retelling of \\nMartin Harris’s February 1828 visit with Charles Anthon and other schol -\\nars, which quotes verbatim an otherwise unattested account from Harris (see \\n1:64–65). The manuscript version of the history and the early publications of \\nthe same also embedded revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants as they \\nwere received at key points in the unfolding early events of the Restoration, \\nbut these were removed by Franklin\\xa0D. Richards in the 1851 Pearl of Great \\nPrice and so are absent from the canonical text. Biblical quotations dot the \\ntext, sometimes explicitly quoted and other times silently alluded to or para -\\nphrased. Beginning in the 1851 Pearl of Great Price, Oliver Cowdery’s 1834 \\nlengthy description of the translation of the Book of Mormon and the priest -\\nhood restoration has footnoted the Prophet’s narrative.\\nThe influence of Joseph’s memory in attempting to reconstruct the events \\nof his early life is on display throughout the history, and especially in the', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 112', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='110   |   Joseph Smith—History\\nportions of the narrative that cover his early life and adolescence. This can \\nbe detected in how the Prophet sometimes uses qualifiers or approximations \\n(for example, “I was in my tenth year, or thereabouts . . . , ” “sometime in \\nthe second year after our removal to Manchester . . . , ” “a little over four -\\nteen years of age . . . , ” “sometime in this month of February . . . , ” “in due \\ntime [it would] be conferred on us . . . ”) when giving some dates and details, \\nwhile at other times providing details that are firm and concrete (see Joseph \\nSmith—History 1:27, 59, 68, 72). This should come as no surprise since some \\nof the events the Prophet recounts occurred when he was a young boy and a \\nteenager nearly two decades earlier. It should also come as no surprise that \\nthe events of 1837–1838 may well have influenced his memory and how he \\nretold his story, including, as mentioned above, the extreme sense of perse -\\ncution Joseph remembers feeling as a young man that is not as pronounced \\nin other histories. Rather than being signs of intentional misrepresentation \\nor deceit, however, these features give the history a marked sense of authen -\\nticity and sincerity. \\nSignificance for Latter-day Saints\\nAfter its canonization with the rest of the Pearl of Great Price on October \\n10, 1880, the impact (and importance) of the 1838 history on the Latter-day \\nSaints’ historical identity grew significantly. Now the Saints had an accessible \\naccount of the founding events of their religion that carried with it canonical \\nweight and authority. Sensing its importance, generations of Saints after the \\nhistory’s canonization have endeavored to reproduce, retell, and disseminate \\nits content and message as widely as possible. From the late nineteenth cen -\\ntury and into the twenty-first, a veritable avalanche of missionary tracts and \\npamphlets; articles; books; Sunday School, priesthood quorum, and Relief \\nSociety curricula; videos; music; and other media reproduced, retold, and \\nrepurposed the canonical text of the 1838 history as the defining institutional \\nand cultural narrative of Joseph Smith’s earliest visionary experiences.\\nBesides serving as the Church’s flagship story of its earliest years, Joseph \\nSmith’s 1838 history has also served as a deep theological wellspring from \\nwhich Latter-day Saints draw out significant doctrinal truths. For example, \\nfrom the Prophet’s account of his First Vision (1:14–20) members of the \\nChurch have extrapolated important points that touch on the nature of the \\nGodhead (that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, are two separate, \\nembodied personages) and the reality of modern revelation. Far from treat -\\ning it as nothing but a dry historical report, the Saints have largely treated the \\ncanonical version of Joseph’s 1838 history as a sacred repository that can be \\nused to formulate lasting theological paradigms. \\nBut perhaps the most pronounced effect the 1838 history has had on the \\nlives and faith of individual Latter-day Saints can be seen in how so many', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 113', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Joseph Smith—History   |   111 \\nhave deeply internalized the Prophet’s story as their own.

In addition, \\nsince the founding of the Church in 1830, publications that sought to discredit Joseph and the \\nChurch continued to multiply and circulate (compare Doctrine and Covenants 123:1–6).

Before moving to Palmyra, Joseph Sr. and Lucy had lived in multi -\\nple towns in Vermont and New Hampshire (including Tunbridge, Vermont; Randolph, Ver -\\nmont; Royalton, Vermont; Sharon, Vermont; Lebanon, New Hampshire; and Norwich, Ver -\\nmont). The move to Manchester, New York . Manchester Township lies just a few miles south of \\nthe Palmyra village to which the Smith family relocated between 1816 and 1817. During the \\nwinter of 1818–1819 the family moved into a log home that was adjacent to forested land in \\nManchester. Although the forested land was in Manchester Township, the cabin itself was still \\nin Palmyra Township (but not the village). 1:5\\xa0The timing of the First Vision . Here the Prophet \\nplaces the timing of the events leading to the First Vision as beginning “some time in the sec -\\nond year after our removal to Manchester, ” meaning 1819–1820. In a previous history (JS1832) \\nhe specified that he became “seriously impressed” with religious matters and the welfare of his \\nsoul “at about the age of twelve years, ” meaning in 1818. Harmonizing the accounts indicates \\nthat the events leading up to the First Vision (Joseph’s personal quest for salvation, his concern \\nover the contention he saw between religious denominations and local revivalism) took place', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 118', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='116   |   Joseph Smith—History\\nterian, and some for the Baptist. 6\\xa0For, \\nnotwithstanding the great love which \\nthe converts to these different faiths \\nexpressed at the time of their conver -\\nsion, and the great zeal manifested by \\nthe respective clergy, who were active \\nin getting up and promoting this ex -\\ntraordinary scene of religious feeling, \\nin order to have everybody convert -\\ned, as they were pleased to call it, let \\nthem join what sect they pleased.

In \\nprocess of time my mind became \\nsomewhat partial to the Methodist \\nbetween the years 1818 and 1820.  Revivals in the Palmyra, New York, area . Historians have \\ndocumented religious revivals and camp meetings occurring in the “region of country” or “the \\nwhole district of country” near Palmyra (or western New Y ork more generally) beginning in \\n1818. Although the 1838 history seems to place this activity principally in 1820, it does not \\nconfine it to only Palmyra. In light of Joseph’s other histories (primarily JS1832), a broader \\nchronological perspective should be kept in mind. Methodism, Presbyterianism, and Baptists . \\nIn addition to these three branches of Protestantism, the early United States was home to \\nCongregationalists, Quakers, Shakers, Episcopalians, Universalists, and other groups in a di -\\nverse religious cultural landscape. Joseph, by his own account, favored Methodism (1:8) but \\ndid not join the movement, while his mother, Hyrum, Samuel, and Sophronia joined the Pres -\\nbyterians (1:7). Joseph Sr. was attracted to Universalism and was otherwise religiously unaffil -\\niated, as were Joseph’s brothers Alvin and William. 1:7\\xa0Joseph’s age at the time of the First Vi -\\nsion is given here as occurring in his “fifteenth year” (meaning when he was fourteen years \\nold). Elsewhere in this account, Joseph gives his age as “between fourteen and fifteen years of \\nage” (1:22) and “a little over fourteen years of age” (1:23) at the time of the event. In other \\nhistories Joseph gave his age as “in the 16th year of my age” (JS1832), “about 14 years old” \\n(JS1835), and “about fourteen years of age” (JS1842). The age given in the 1838 history is con -\\nsistent with the 1835 and 1842 histories and with contemporary secondhand accounts \\n(OP1840, OH1842, DNW1843). Joseph’s age in the 1832 history was inserted interlineally by \\nscribe Frederick\\xa0G. Williams and is off by one year in the other accounts (Joseph would have \\nbeen fifteen years old in the sixteenth year of his age).

But so great were the \\nconfusion and strife among the dif -\\nferent denominations, that it was im -\\npossible for a person young as I was, \\nand so unacquainted with men and \\nthings, to come to any certain con -\\nclusion who was right and who was \\nwrong. 9\\xa0My mind at times was great -\\nly excited, the cry and tumult were \\nso great and incessant. The Presbyte -\\nrians were most decided against the \\nBaptists and Methodists, and used \\nall the powers of both reason and \\nsophistry to prove their errors, or, at \\nleast, to make the people think they \\nwere in error. On the other hand, the \\nBaptists and Methodists in their turn \\nwere equally zealous in endeavoring \\nto establish their own tenets and dis -\\nprove all others. 10\\xa0In the midst of this \\nwar of words and tumult of opinions, \\nI often said to myself, “What is to be \\ndone? Who of all these parties are \\nright, or, are they all wrong together? \\nIf any one of them be right, which is \\nit, and how shall I know it?” Joseph Turns to the Bible\\n11\\xa0While I was laboring under the ex -\\ntreme difficulties caused by the con -\\ntests of these parties of religionists, \\nI was one day reading the Epistle of \\nJames, first chapter and fifth verse, \\nwhich reads, “If any of you lack wis -\\ndom, let him ask of God, that giveth \\nto all men liberally, and upbraideth \\nnot; and it shall be given him. ” 12\\xa0Nev-\\ner did any passage of scripture come \\nwith more power to the heart of man \\nthan this did at this time to mine. It \\nseemed to enter with great force into \\nevery feeling of my heart. I reflected \\non it again and again, knowing that \\nif any person needed wisdom from \\nGod, I did. For how to act I did not \\nknow, and unless I could get more \\nwisdom than I then had, I would \\nnever know. For the teachers of reli -\\ngion of the different sects understood \\nthe same passages of scripture so dif -\\nferently as to destroy all confidence \\nin settling the question by an appeal \\nto the Bible. 13\\xa0At length I came to the \\nconclusion that I must either remain \\nin darkness and confusion, or else I \\npoor arithmetic on the Prophet’s part. 1:11\\xa0 The first of many scriptural citations in the 1838 \\nhistory appears here. The language at 1:5 draws from Luke 17:21 (“Lo, here! Lo, there!”), but \\nthis is the first overt scriptural citation. James 1:5, however, was not the only biblical passage \\nthat Joseph drew inspiration from as he wrestled with which faith to join. His 1835 account \\n(JS1835) reports that Matthew 7:7 also prompted him to seek God in prayer. Additionally, the \\n1832 history (JS1832) recounts the influence of Hebrews 13:8 and Psalm 14:1 on young Jo -\\nseph’s thinking at the time. But as the Prophet indicates here, it was James 1:5 that had the \\nmost profound effect on him, as also mentioned in the other contemporary first- and second -\\nhand renditions of the First Vision. 1:13\\xa0 Joseph’s primary motivation to seek God in prayer in \\nthis account is to resolve his confusion over which denomination to join. In the 1832 history \\n(JS1832) the emphasis is on Joseph seeking forgiveness for his sins. These motives are not \\nmutually exclusive. Besides the obvious fact that one of the main reasons people join a partic -\\nular religious denomination over another is precisely to achieve a sense of salvation and an \\nassurance of eternal security, historians have pointed out how these two categories had con -\\nceptual overlap in conversion accounts (especially Methodist accounts) contemporary with', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 120', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='118   |   Joseph Smith—History\\nmust do as James directs, that is, ask \\nof God. I at length came to the deter -\\nmination to ask of God, concluding \\nthat if he gave wisdom to them that \\nlacked wisdom, and would give liber -\\nally, and not upbraid, I might venture.\\nThe First Vision\\n14\\xa0So, in accordance with this, my de -\\ntermination to ask of God, I retired \\nto the woods to make the attempt. It \\nwas on the morning of a beautiful, \\nclear day, early in the spring of eigh -\\nteen hundred and twenty. It was the \\nfirst time in my life that I had made \\nsuch an attempt, for amidst all my \\nanxieties I had never as yet made the \\nattempt to pray vocally. 15\\xa0After I had \\nretired to the place where I had pre -\\nviously designed to go, having looked \\naround me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up \\nthe desires of my heart to God. I had \\nscarcely done so, when immediate -\\nly I was seized upon by some pow -\\ner which entirely overcame me and \\nhad such an astonishing influence \\nover me as to bind my tongue so that \\nI could not speak. Thick darkness \\ngathered around me, and it seemed \\nto me for a time as if I were doomed \\nto sudden destruction. 16\\xa0But, exert -\\ning all my powers to call upon God \\nto deliver me out of the power of this \\nenemy which had seized upon me, \\nand at the very moment when I was \\nready to sink into despair and aban -\\ndon myself to destruction—not to an \\nimaginary ruin, but to the power of \\nsome actual being from the unseen \\nworld, who had such marvelous pow -\\ner as I had never before felt in any \\nthe Prophet. Both motivations could be true at the same time: confused and dismayed over the \\nreligious divisions of his day (and even in his own family, which was religiously split), Joseph \\nfelt insecure and unsure about his eternal standing before God and so sought wisdom about \\nwhich church to join precisely to find some assurance that he would achieve salvation.  \\n1:14–15\\xa0 Timing of the vision . In this history Joseph places the timing of the First Vision “early \\nin the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. ” This is the most precise any of the Prophet’s \\nfirsthand accounts get in timing the vision. Satan attempts to stop Joseph . The supernatural \\nopposition that attempted to prevent young Joseph from praying is also mentioned in the \\nProphet’s 1835 account (JS1835). In this account Joseph describes how his “tongue seemed to \\nbe swollen in [his] mouth” so that he was unable to speak, and he writes that he “heard a noise \\nbehind [him], like some person walking towards [him]. ” When he looked around he “saw no \\nperson or thing that was calculated to produce the noise of walking. ” The language and imag -\\nery of Joseph being surrounded by darkness and feeling doomed to destruction but rallying \\nhis strength to continue calling on God parallels the experience of Moses described at Moses \\n1:20. The secondhand account provided by Orson Hyde (OH1842) speaks of this “thick dark -\\nness” as a “dark cloud” and mentions the adversary filling Joseph’s mind “with doubts and .\\xa0.\\xa0. \\nall manner of inappropriate images. ” 1:16\\xa0 Each of Joseph’s firsthand accounts mentions a \\nbright, fiery light that the boy saw in the vision. In the 1832 history (JS1832) the Prophet de -\\nscribed seeing “a pillar of fire” but then crossed out “fire” and substituted it with the word \\n“light. ” The 1835 account (JS1835) mentions “a pillar of fire, ” or a “pillar of flame which was \\nspread all around and yet nothing consumed. ” And the 1842 Wentworth Letter (JS1842) \\nspeaks of “a brilliant light which eclipsed the sun at noon-day. ” Contemporary secondhand \\naccounts report the same thing: Orson Pratt (OP1840) described “a very bright and glorious', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 121', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Joseph Smith—History   |   119 \\nbeing—just at this moment of great \\nalarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly \\nover my head, above the brightness \\nof the sun, which descended grad -\\nually until it fell upon me. 17\\xa0(It no \\nsooner appeared than I found myself \\ndelivered from the enemy which held \\nme bound.)\\nWhen the light rested upon me, \\nI saw two Personages, whose bright -\\nness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of \\nthem spake unto me, calling me by \\nname and said, pointing to the other, \\n“This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” \\n18\\xa0My object in going to inquire of the \\nLord was to know which of all the \\nsects was right, that I might know \\nwhich to join. No sooner, therefore, \\ndid I get possession of myself, so as to \\nbe able to speak, than I asked the Per -\\nsonages who stood above me in the \\nlight in the heavens above, ” and David Nye White (DNW1843) simply calls it “a light, ” while \\nAlexander Neibaur (AN1844) records “a fire towards heaven. ” 1:17\\xa0 Two Personages . With one \\nexception, each first- and secondhand account of the First Vision from the Prophet’s lifetime \\nexplicitly speaks of young Joseph seeing two heavenly personages. Some of these accounts \\n(JS1835; DNW1843; AN1844) describe one personage appearing before the other, and other \\naccounts (OP1840; OH1842; JS1842) describe the two personages as appearing exactly alike \\nin features and likeness. Although Joseph himself did not record a detailed description of the \\npersonages he saw, one secondhand account (AN1844) records that Joseph described the per -\\nsonage in the pillar of fire or light as having “light complexion [and] blue eyes” with “a piece \\nof white cloth drawn over his shoulders, his right arm bear. ” The exception mentioned above \\nis the 1832 history (JS1832), which does not overtly speak of two personages. It records, “The \\nLord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord. ” Scholars have proposed various ways \\nto reconcile the 1832 history with the later accounts. The most persuasive is that the title Lord, \\nused twice, is referring to God the Father in the first instance and then to the Son in the sec -\\nond. This would harmonize with the accounts that speak of one personage appearing before \\nthe other and that claim that the two personages looked exactly alike. “This is My Beloved Son. \\nHear Him!”  Two secondhand accounts (DNW1843, AN1844) report that this testimony was \\ngiven by the Father during the vision. The 1832 and 1835 accounts (JS1832, JS1835) might \\nallude to the Father’s testimony but are not explicit. These two accounts, as well as Orson \\nPratt’s (OP1842), mention that the Lord forgave Joseph’s sins. 1:18\\xa0 As noted above (see the \\ncommentary at 1:13), in this account the main question Joseph raises is which church he \\nshould join. This agrees with many of the other reports of the vision (JS1835; OP1840; \\nOH1842; JS1842; DNW1843; AN1844). In his earliest account (JS1832), the Prophet empha -\\nsized his personal search for salvation without explicitly couching this quest in the context of \\nwhat denomination he should join. Never entered into my heart . This phrase (“for at this time \\nit had never entered into my heart that all were wrong”) was, for reasons unknown, omitted in \\nthe 1902 edition of the Pearl of Great Price and was not restored until the 1981 edition. It is \\npresent in the manuscript version of this history, in the T&S  and MS printings, and in the first \\ntwo editions of the Pearl of Great Price (1851 and 1878). In another draft of the 1838 history \\nthe parenthetical comment reads, “For I supposed that one of them were so, ” which suggests \\nsome amount of ambivalence was still in Joseph’s mind at the time of the vision. At first glance, \\nthis parenthetical remark would appear to contradict Joseph Smith—History 1:10 (“Who of \\nall these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together?”) and the 1832 account (JS1832) in', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 122', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='this parenthetical remark would appear to contradict Joseph Smith—History 1:10 (“Who of \\nall these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together?”) and the 1832 account (JS1832) in \\nwhich Joseph reports he had “found that mankind did not come unto the Lord, but that they \\nhad apostatized from the true and living faith, and there was no society or denomination that', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 122', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='120   |   Joseph Smith—History\\nlight, which of all the sects was right \\n(for at this time it had never entered \\ninto my heart that all were wrong) \\nand which I should join. 19\\xa0I was an -\\nswered that I must join none of them, \\nfor they were all wrong, and the Per -\\nsonage who addressed me said that \\nall their creeds were an abomination \\nin his sight; that those professors \\nwere all corrupt; that they draw near \\nto me with their lips, but their hearts \\nare far from me; they teach for doc -\\ntrines the commandments of men, \\nhaving a form of godliness, but they \\ndeny the power thereof . 20\\xa0He again forbade me to join \\nwith any of them, and many other \\nthings did he say unto me, which I \\ncannot write at this time. When I \\ncame to myself again, I found my -\\nself lying on my back, looking up \\ninto heaven. When the light had de -\\nparted, I had no strength. But soon \\nrecovering in some degree, I went \\nhome. And as I leaned up to the fire -\\nplace, mother inquired what the mat -\\nter was. I replied, “Never mind, all is \\nwell—I am well enough off. ” I then \\nsaid to my mother, “I have learned \\nfor myself that Presbyterianism is not \\n[was] built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament. ” Scholars have \\nproposed various ways to read these accounts in harmony and stress that minor variations \\nsuch as these do not suggest calculating attempts to fabricate a story. 1:19\\xa0 They were all wrong . \\nHere and in the next verse Joseph is informed by the Lord that the churches of his day were in \\napostasy and that he should join none of them. This point is captured in all the extant accounts \\nof the vision from the Prophet’s lifetime except one (JS1835). Joseph’s choice to report the \\nLord’s rather blunt and sweeping condemnations in this account (for example, “they were all \\nwrong . . . , ” “all their creeds were an abomination . . . , ” “those professors were all corrupt . . . ”) \\nmay be at least partially in response to the recent opposition and hostility in Kirtland and \\nMissouri that were fresh on the Prophet’s mind (see also the discussion in the commentary at \\nJoseph Smith—History 1:1, 22–23). Another one of Joseph’s firsthand accounts (JS1842) uses \\nmuch softer language than is used in this verse. It should also be kept in mind that this is Jo -\\nseph’s paraphrasing of what the Lord told him, not necessarily a direct quotation, so it is un -\\ncertain how much of the language is specifically from the Lord and how much was shaped by \\nJoseph himself. They draw near  .\\xa0.\\xa0. the power thereof . Quotations or paraphrases of Isaiah \\n29:13 and 2\\xa0Timothy 3:5. According to two accounts (JS1832 and AN1844) the Lord also drew \\nfrom the language of Psalm 14:3 (“there is none that doeth good, no, not one”). The totalizing \\nlanguage in Psalm 14:3 is congruent with the Lord’s sweeping condemnations in Joseph \\nSmith—History 1:19. 1:20\\xa0 Joseph indicates that he deliberately left out some of the Lord’s \\nwords to him in the vision. We are left to speculate on exactly what else the Lord may have told \\nhim, but from details in the other extant accounts of the vision, it most likely included matters \\nrelated to the apostasy, the forthcoming restoration of the gospel, and Joseph’s personal stand -\\ning before God. In the 1835 account (JS1835) the Prophet indicates that he saw “many angels” \\nin the vision. The number and identity of these angels and whether they too related anything \\nto Joseph in the vision is unknown. Joseph also fails to describe how long the vision lasted. \\nSince he was told “many other things” during the vision that are not recorded and since, as he \\nsays next, when he came to himself he was lying on his back and physically exhausted (see also \\nDWN1843), it might be supposed that the vision lasted some time.

And \\nthough I was an obscure boy, only \\nbetween fourteen and fifteen years \\nof age, and my circumstances in life \\nsuch as to make a boy of no conse -\\nquence in the world, yet men of high \\nstanding would take notice sufficient \\nto excite the public mind against \\nme, and create a bitter persecution. \\nAnd this was common among all the \\nsects—all united to persecute me. \\n23\\xa0It caused me serious reflection \\nthen, and often has since, how very \\nstrange it was that an obscure boy, \\nof a little over fourteen years of age, \\nand one, too, who was doomed to the \\nnecessity of obtaining a scanty main -\\ntenance by his daily labor, should be \\ncalling that earlier at 1:7 he specifies that his mother and some siblings had joined the local \\nPresbyterian church).

This portion of the narrative \\nwas inserted into the text as an addendum by Willard Richards on December 2, 1842, proba -\\nbly at the time Joseph related the incident to him. 1:21–23\\xa0 The Methodist preacher . The identi -\\nty of this preacher is unknown. One promising candidate is Reverend George Lane (1784–\\n1859). Lane was active as an itinerant minister in northern Pennsylvania and western New \\nY ork between 1819 and 1825. Secondhand sources (for example, OC1834) identify Lane as \\nbeing one of the ministers who had a pronounced influence on young Joseph in prompting \\nhim to seek God in prayer. But there are problems with accepting Lane as this minister, not the \\nleast being that the Prophet himself does not positively identify him. The preacher’s reaction . \\nJoseph remembers how shocked he was at how contemptuously the preacher treated the ac -\\ncount of his vision. The reaction obviously made enough of an impression that eighteen years \\nlater the Prophet still remembered it. This negative first reaction to Joseph telling others about \\nhis vision may account, in part, for why the Prophet was generally reluctant to publicly report \\nhis visionary experiences. Persecution . Here the theme of persecution against the Prophet ap -\\npears at its strongest. Joseph mentions the negative, skeptical reaction he received when he \\ntold others about his vision in some of his other accounts (for example, JS1832), but it is in this \\nretelling that the language is most potent.

But strange \\nor not, so it was, and it was often the \\ncause of great sorrow to myself. \\nJoseph Affirms the Reality \\nof His Vision\\n24\\xa0However, it was nevertheless a fact \\nthat I had beheld a vision. I have \\nthought since, that I felt much like \\nPaul, when he made his defense be -\\nfore King Agrippa, and related the \\naccount of the vision he had when he \\nsaw a light, and heard a voice, but still \\nthere were but few who believed him. \\nSome said he was dishonest, others \\nsaid he was mad, and he was ridi -\\nculed and reviled. But all this did not \\ndestroy the reality of his vision. He \\nhad seen a vision, he knew he had, \\nand all the persecution under heav -\\nen could not make it otherwise. And \\nthough they should persecute him \\nunto death, yet he knew, and would \\nknow to his latest breath, that he had \\nboth seen a light and heard a voice \\nspeaking unto him, and all the world \\ncould not make him think or believe otherwise. \\n25\\xa0So it was with me. I had actu -\\nally seen a light, and in the midst of \\nthat light I saw two Personages, and \\nthey did in reality speak to me, and \\nthough I was hated and persecuted \\nfor saying that I had seen a vision, \\nyet it was true. And while they were \\npersecuting me, reviling me, and \\nspeaking all manner of evil against \\nme falsely for so saying, I was led to \\nsay in my heart, “Why persecute me \\nfor telling the truth?” I have actual -\\nly seen a vision, and who am I that I \\ncan withstand God, or why does the \\nworld think to make me deny what \\nI have actually seen? For I had seen \\na vision. I knew it, and I knew that \\nGod knew it, and I could not deny it, \\nneither dared I do it. At least I knew \\nthat by so doing I would offend God \\nand come under condemnation. 26\\xa0I \\nhad now got my mind satisfied so \\nfar as the sectarian world was con -\\ncerned—that it was not my duty to \\njoin with any of them, but to contin -\\nue as I was until further directed. I \\nhad found the testimony of James to \\nbe true—that a man who lacked wis -\\ndom might ask of God, and obtain, \\nand not be upbraided.\\ngree and severity of this opposition, as well as the language he chose to describe it, was influ -\\nenced by the recent persecutions of Kirtland and Missouri. 1:24–26\\xa0 Joseph compares himself to \\nthe Apostle Paul . See Acts 26. Joseph uses the bold defense Paul offered before Herod Agrippa \\nII as a comparable example to his own feelings and experience as he affirmed the reality of his \\nvision before a skeptical public.

However, here the Prophet insists that he is not guilty “of \\nany great or malignant sins. ” (This qualifier was likely added both to prevent the wrong im -\\npression and to rebut public accusations of Joseph’s alleged deplorable behavior.)

Description of the messenger . In an earlier history (JS1835) the Prophet described \\nhow with the angel’s appearance “the room was illuminated above the brightness of the sun. ” \\nAccording to this account, Moroni’s features were “naked, pure, and white, ” and the personage \\nwas “clothed with purity inexpressible. ” Oliver Cowdery (OC1834) similarly reported “a light \\nlike that of day, only of a purer and far more glorious appearance and brightness” appearing in \\nthe room with the visitation of the angel, who Cowdery described as having a “countenance \\n[like] lightning” and wearing a “garment [that] was perfectly white. ” 1:33 \\xa0In the manuscript \\ncopy, the name of the angel is given here as Nephi. This was almost certainly a clerical or scrib -\\nal error. Sources from both before and after the 1838 history, including those from Joseph \\nhimself, identify the messenger as Moroni. The error in the manuscript, however, was not \\ncaught until decades after its composition, and so the mistaken identity of the angel was per -\\npetuated in print, including in the T&S  and MS printings of the history in the 1840s and in the \\n1851 first edition of the Pearl of Great Price. 1:34\\xa0 Here the Book of Mormon, including its \\norigin and contents, is referenced for the first time in this history.

He also said that \\nthe fulness of the everlasting Gospel \\nwas contained in it, as delivered by \\nthe Savior to the ancient inhabitants. \\n35\\xa0Also, that there were two stones in \\nsilver bows—and these stones, fas -\\ntened to a breastplate, constituted \\nwhat is called the Urim and Thum -\\nmim—deposited with the plates; and the possession and use of these \\nstones were what constituted “seers” \\nin ancient or former times, and that \\nGod had prepared them for the pur -\\npose of translating the book. \\n36\\xa0After telling me these things, he \\ncommenced quoting the prophecies \\nof the Old Testament. He first quoted \\npart of the third chapter of Malachi; \\nbringing forth and translating the record will occupy the next thirty-four verses. As with the \\nFirst Vision, the Prophet gave multiple accounts of the coming forth and translation of the \\nBook of Mormon. Many of these accounts, in fact, were retold right alongside his other rendi -\\ntions of the First Vision (see JS1832; JS1835; JS1842). Clearly in Joseph’s mind the two events \\nwere linked and were considered foundational to his prophetic calling. Written upon gold \\nplates . Joseph and other witnesses to the plates, or those who otherwise handled them in some \\ncapacity, described them as being gold or having “the appearance of gold”; weighing between \\nforty to sixty pounds; measuring about six or seven inches wide, eight inches long, and four to \\nsix inches thick; having individual plates as thick as “common tin” or parchment; having a \\nportion sealed; having three D-shaped rings binding the plates; and being “engraved” on both \\nsides with “characters” or “hieroglyphics. ” An account of the former inhabitants of this conti -\\nnent . Although on occasion the Prophet appealed to artifacts from both North and Central \\nAmerica as evidence for the antiquity of the Book of Mormon, he never gave a detailed de -\\nscription of the geography or of the ancient setting of the events recorded in the text. During \\nthe Prophet’s lifetime, readers of the book began formulating geography theories to situate the \\ntext in a real-world setting, but none of these nor any subsequent theories have ever arisen to \\nthe level of revealed authority for the Church as a whole. In her memoirs (LMS1844), Joseph’s \\nmother, Lucy Mack Smith, related how Moroni instructed young Joseph about the ancient \\ninhabitants of America as the boy prepared for the recovery and translation of the record, a \\ndetail the Prophet also reported in another history (JS1842). 1:35\\xa0 Joseph’s use of the term \\n“Urim and Thummim” to describe the instrument he recovered with the plates (compare \\nJS1835) likely takes its lead from early Church leaders W .\\xa0 W . Phelps and Oliver Cowdery \\n(OC1834, including the excerpted passage below), who both had previously drawn a connec -\\ntion between the biblical oracular device and the Nephite “interpreters” (see Exodus 28:30; \\nNumbers 27:21; Mosiah 8:13; 28:11, 13) in Church publications. In his earliest account of the \\ncoming forth of the Book of Mormon (JS1832), the Prophet described this instrument as a set \\nof “spectacles” that had been prepared to translate the book without giving it the name Urim \\nand Thummim. Besides attesting to the use of the Nephite interpreters that were deposited \\nwith the plates, eyewitnesses to the translation of the Book of Mormon also described Joseph \\nplacing another seer stone in his possession in the bottom of a hat, drawing the brim of the hat \\nover his face to block out external light, and then reading off the translated words as they ap -\\npeared in the stone. It is unclear precisely when in the course of translation the Prophet used \\nthe Nephite interpreters and when he used his personal seer stone.

For they that come shall \\nburn them, saith the Lord of Hosts, \\nthat it shall leave them neither root \\nnor branch. ” 38\\xa0And again, he quoted \\nthe fifth verse thus, “Behold, I will \\nreveal unto you the Priesthood, by \\nthe hand of Elijah the prophet, before \\nthe coming of the great and dreadful \\nday of the Lord. ” 39\\xa0He also quoted the \\nnext verse differently, “ And he shall \\nplant in the hearts of the children the \\npromises made to the fathers, and \\nthe hearts of the children shall turn \\nto their fathers. If it were not so, the \\nwhole earth would be utterly wasted \\nat his coming. ” \\n40\\xa0In addition to these, he quoted \\nthe eleventh chapter of Isaiah, say -\\ning that it was about to be fulfilled. \\nHe quoted also the third chapter \\nof Acts, twenty-second and twen -\\nty-third verses, precisely as they stand in our New Testament. He said \\nthat that prophet was Christ, but the \\nday had not yet come when they who \\nwould not hear his voice should be \\ncut off from among the people, but \\nsoon would come. 41\\xa0He also quoted \\nthe second chapter of Joel, from the \\ntwenty-eighth verse to the last.

They lived at \\nfirst with Emma’s parents but shortly thereafter moved into their own small home near her \\nparents’ house. 1:63\\xa0 According to Joseph’s 1832 history (JS1832) the decision to send Martin \\nto New Y ork with a copy of the characters from the Book of Mormon plates came at the \\nprompting of a revelation.

The de -\\ntails and outcome of Harris’s visit with Bradish are unknown. Historical sources do not make \\nit clear whether Harris visited Mitchell before or after Anthon. By his account, Harris makes it \\nsound as though he visited Anthon and then Mitchell (1:65), but other sources reverse the \\norder. In either case, these are the three known contacts Harris made as he consulted with \\nscholars. Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyriac, and Arabic .

An account of the loss of the \\n116 pages had previously been recorded in Joseph’s 1832 history (JS1832), and in fact, the \\nmanuscript version of this history as well as the T&S  and MS publications contain an account \\nof the loss of the 116 pages and reproduce the revelations that are now sections 3, 4, 5, and 10 \\nof the Doctrine and Covenants.

Oliver \\nCowdery (1806–1850) served as the principal scribe in the translation of the Book of Mormon \\nfrom April 1829 to its completion in mid- or late-June of that year. With some assistance, he \\nalso prepared a copy of the original manuscript of the book for publication. Besides being \\ninformed of Joseph’s divine calling by the Smith family (as mentioned in this verse), according \\nto Joseph’s 1832 history Oliver also had a vision of the plates and felt a confirming witness \\nfrom God that he should assist in the work (compare Doctrine and Covenants 6:22–23).

In 1840, Apostles \\n(and brothers) Parley and Orson Pratt both published their own formula -\\ntions of the essentials of Latter-day Saint doctrine.

Although they may appear random at first glance, the Articles of \\nFaith in fact can be classified into distinct, purposeful theological categories. \\nThe first and second articles elucidate the Latter-day Saint view of the nature \\nof God and humanity, thus satisfying what is arguably the most important \\nmetaphysical groundwork that must be laid in any discussion of theology. \\nThe third and fourth articles touch on soteriology, or the theology of salva -\\ntion. The fifth, sixth, and seventh articles overview the ecclesiastical struc -\\nture of the Church of Jesus Christ and the spiritual gifts that accompany the \\noffices of the Church. The eighth and ninth articles declare the nature of the \\ncanon and ongoing revelation. The tenth article touches on eschatology, or \\nthe theology of the culmination of the earth’s and humanity’s destined fu -\\nture.

For example, the third article affirms that \\nhumanity can only be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the \\ngospel of Jesus Christ, and the fourth article then expounds on what these \\nlaws and ordinances are. The fifth article clarifies that proper ordination to \\necclesiastical office comes by prophecy and the laying on of hands by one \\nin authority, then the sixth explains what those offices are, and the seventh \\nnames the spiritual gifts that operate in those offices. The eighth article af -\\nfirms the canonical authority of the scriptural record, while the ninth adds \\nto it by explaining that the canon remains open because revelation continues \\nin the Church of Jesus Christ. The articles’ progressive nature and logical or -\\ndering invites readers to ponder on their relationship to each other and their \\nsignificance within this broader schema.\\nJoseph Smith’s signature has appeared at the end of the Articles of Faith \\nsince they were first published in 1842 and in each edition of the Pearl of \\nGreat Price since 1851. This fulfills the practical need of identifying the au -\\nthor and reinforces their prophetic weight and authority.  \\nSignificance for Latter-day Saints\\nWhether the Nicene Creed of the fourth century AD or the Westminster \\nConfession of the seventeenth, Latter-day Saints are characteristically sus -\\npicious of the classical Christian creeds that, in their view, impose restric -\\ntive theological boundaries that stifle the unfolding process of revelation \\nand restoration. In a discourse delivered on October 15, 1843, Joseph Smith, \\ndrawing from the language of Job 38:11, voiced his frustration with creeds \\nthat “set up stakes and say ‘hitherto shalt thou come, and no further. ’” But \\nthe Articles of Faith, as some have pointed out, can arguably be viewed as a \\nset of de facto creeds for the Latter-day Saints. (The very word creed  comes \\nfrom the Latin credo , meaning “I believe. ”) This apparent paradox highlights \\nthe tension inherent between the efforts of Latter-day Saints beginning with \\nJoseph Smith to codify and systematize their theology on the one hand and \\nthe expansive, progressive nature of revelation in the Church of Jesus Christ \\non the other.\\nThe solution to this paradox would be, it seems, to view the Articles of \\nFaith not as strict demarcations of religious identity to which the faithful \\nmust strictly adhere but rather as an executive summary of just some of the \\nfundamental doctrines underpinning the Restoration. This, indeed, is how \\nJoseph Smith treated them in the context of his letter to John Wentworth and \\nis how Latter-day Saints have typically approached them. That the Articles \\nof Faith were likely not intended to function in the same way as the classical \\nChristian creeds can further be seen in what they leave out.

Missionaries, too, are encouraged to use the \\narticles in proselytizing efforts as a quick, accessible way to clarify the basic \\nprinciples of the gospel. In this way they are following in the footsteps of \\nJoseph Smith, who in 1842 used a valuable missionary opportunity to formu -\\nlate these articles of faith that are cherished by Saints across the globe nearly \\ntwo centuries later.\\nSelected Bibliography\\nBenson, RoseAnn. “The Articles of Faith: Answering the Doctrinal Ques -\\ntions of the ‘Second Great Awakening. ’” In Joseph Smith and the Doctri -\\nnal Restoration , edited by W .\\xa0Jeffrey Marsh, 46–64.

The existence of a loving \\nHeavenly Father who is personally concerned with the lives and salvation of His children \\nunderpins the Saints’ worldview and sense of purpose in life. Of equal importance to this \\nworldview and sense of purpose is the divine sonship of Jesus Christ, who performed an in -\\nfinite atonement to draw the Father’s children back into His presence, a point that is reiterated \\nin the third article. Finally, the Father’s means of communicating with His children and of \\nrevealing to them light and truth is accomplished through the Holy Ghost, who stands next \\nto the Father and the Son as the third member of the Godhead. Joseph Smith’s teachings on the \\nGodhead . In a discourse delivered sometime around May 1841, the Prophet taught that an “ev -\\nerlasting covenant was made between three personages before the organizations of the earth, \\nand relates to their dispensation of things to men on the earth. These personages, according \\nto Abraham’s record, are called God the First, the Creator; God the Second, the Redeemer; \\nand God the Third, the Witness or Testator. ” This detail is missing from the extant text of \\nthe book of Abraham (suggesting that the Prophet had translated or revealed more material \\nthan is presently published). In any case, it demonstrates the influence the Prophet’s scriptural \\ntranslations and revelations had on his theological thought as it developed line upon line. \\nOn June 15, 1844, in one of his last public discourses before his death, the Prophet told his \\naudience, “I have always declared God to be a distinct personage, Jesus Christ a separate and \\ndistinct personage from God the Father, and the Holy Ghost was a distinct personage and \\na Spirit; and that these three constitute three distinct personages and three Gods. ” Though \\nnot explicitly detailed in the first article of faith, this teaching and the Prophet’s revelations \\non God’s corporeality and humankind’s potential for divinization and exaltation (articulated \\nmost forcefully in the April 7, 1844, King Follet Sermon) are the most radical departures from \\nclassical Christian thought on the nature of God.\\n2 Latter-day Saints challenge the historical Christian teaching of original sin and what it theo -\\nlogically implies about the inherently sinful, depraved state of humanity. First formulated \\nby St. Augustine in the fourth century AD, the doctrine of original sin posits that humanity \\ninherited the consequences and, crucially, the culpability  of Adam’s sin on account of their \\ndescent from the first man. The full nature and scope of original sin has been debated among \\nChristian theologians since Augustine’s day. Latter-day Saints do not deny humanity’s need for \\nredemption, as articulated in the next article, nor the deleterious affects the Fall of Adam and \\nEve have had on humanity, but they do deny the total depravity and culpability of humanity \\nfor Adam and Eve’s transgression. A revelation given to Joseph Smith on May 6, 1833, affirms', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 146', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='144   |   The Articles of Faith\\n3We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be \\nsaved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.\\n4We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: \\nfirst, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism \\nby immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for \\nthe gift of the Holy Ghost.\\nthat “every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man from \\nthe fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God” (Doctrine and Cove -\\nnants 93:38).\\n3 Closely related to this belief in the Fall of Adam and Eve is Latter-day Saints’ belief in the \\nneed for a Savior to achieve an infinite atonement that will redeem humanity (compare 2\\xa0Ne -\\nphi 9:7). Without a Fall, there is no need for a Redemption. Soteriology, or the theology of \\nsalvation, concerns itself with attempting to understand and formulate how men and women \\nachieve salvation and overcome the effects of the Fall. The two crucial questions underlying \\nany discussion of soteriology are how salvation is achieved and who can achieve it. The first \\nquestion asks what the relationship is between faith, grace, and works, while the second asks \\nabout the scope of Christ’s Atonement regarding who it saves. Answers to these questions var -\\nied greatly in the Christian world of Joseph Smith’s day, with Calvinists and other Reformed \\nChristians on the one end teaching a limited atonement for only those God had predestined to \\nbe saved and Universalists on the other side teaching unconditional universal salvation for all \\nhumanity. Many Christians likewise disagreed over the proper role between faith and works \\nin salvation. Latter-day Saints reject the soteriological extremes of Reformed Protestantism on \\nthe one hand and Universalism on the other and insist that all men and women may be saved \\n(thus denying limited atonement) while also affirming that it can only be achieved through \\nobedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel (thus denying unconditional salvation).\\n4 The fourth article develops the third by clarifying the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ \\nto which men and women must be obedient to be saved. This is clearer in the T&S  rendition \\nof the first line of this article, which reads, “We believe these ordinances are .\\xa0.\\xa0. , ” with the \\nantecedent to “these ordinances” being “the laws and ordinances of the Gospel” of the third \\narticle. This reading was retained until the 1902 edition of the Pearl of Great Price, where it \\nwas changed to its current reading on the recommendation of James\\xa0E. Talmage. The primary \\ndefinition of ordinance  in Joseph Smith’s day was “a rule established by authority; a permanent \\nrule of action” (Noah Webster’s 1828 dictionary). In this regard, faith and repentance can \\nindeed be seen as ordinances as well as principles of the gospel. Additional principles of the \\ngospel . In a discourse delivered between June 26 and July 2, 1839, Joseph Smith indicated that \\n“the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgement are necessary to preach \\namong the first principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. ”', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 147', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='The Articles of Faith   |   145 \\n5We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the \\nlaying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel \\nand administer in the ordinances thereof.\\n6We believe in the same organization that existed in the primitive church, \\nnamely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.\\n7We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, \\ninterpretation of tongues, and so forth.\\n5 Here the Prophet identifies three components that go into qualifying those who preach the \\ngospel and administer its ordinances: first, being called by the spirit of revelation; second, \\nbeing set apart by the laying on of hands; and third, being set apart by those in authority. \\nThis article addresses concerns the Christian world has historically had over the question of \\nauthority: where does it derive, and how does it operate? The Latter-day Saint emphasis on \\npriesthood ordination to qualify those who administer the ordinances of the gospel diverges \\nfrom historical and contemporary Protestantism and aligns itself more closely with Catholic \\nand Orthodox understanding.\\n6 Just as the fourth article builds on the third, so the sixth builds on the fifth by enumerating \\nthe offices that comprise the ecclesiastical structure of the Church of Jesus Christ. The fifth \\narticle describes how an individual attains an office in the Church, while the sixth lists what \\nsome of those offices are. The primitive church . Here the adjective “primitive” should not be \\ntaken to mean “simple or unsophisticated” but rather “earlier, ancient, or primeval. ” The prim -\\nitive church refers to the church established by Jesus during His mortal ministry. The five offic -\\nes listed by the Prophet are attested in the New Testament as having been operative during the \\nfirst century church, and indeed, the language of this article appears to be following Ephesians \\n4:11. Although Joseph Smith taught that the offices of the modern Church of Jesus Christ rep -\\nresent a restoration of those offices in the primitive church of the first century, it should not be \\nassumed that the organizational structure of the Church today represents a static, one-for-one \\ncarbon copy or replica of the apostolic church. \\n7 Along with the restoration of the offices of the primitive church comes the restoration of its \\ngifts and powers. The seventh article enumerates some of these gifts, which are described by \\nPaul in 1\\xa0Corinthians 12 (compare Moroni 10:8–18; Doctrine and Covenants 46:13–26).

In the Wentworth Letter the \\nProphet emphasized that the Book of Mormon was to “be united with the Bible for the ac -\\ncomplishment of the purposes of God in the last days. ” Although not mentioned in this article, \\nthe Doctrine and Covenants as a book of living scripture—a book of current, ongoing reve -\\nlation—is implicitly assumed in the next article. By naming the Book of Mormon alongside \\nthe Bible as the word of God, Joseph affirmed that the canon of scripture was open and that \\nhe was in a position by virtue of his own prophetic office to produce new scripture. As far as it \\nis translated correctly . This article rejects the Protestant doctrine of sola scriptura , or the belief \\nthat scripture alone is sufficient for establishing doctrine and authority in the church. One of \\nthe truths the Prophet learned through his revelations and work on the “new translation” or \\nrevision of the Bible from 1830 to 1833 is that the Bible is on its own insufficient and suffered \\nfrom errors of translation, transmission, and interpretation (all three of these concepts are \\nassumed under the Prophet’s use of the word “translation” in this article). As Joseph taught in \\nan October 15, 1843, discourse, “I believe the Bible as it ought to be, as it came from the pen \\nof the original writers. ”\\n9 Once again, as with articles four and three and six and five, this article builds on the one \\nthat immediately precedes it by confirming that with an open canon of scripture comes also \\ncontinuing revelation. This principle is foundational to the faith of the Latter-day Saints, who \\nuphold that God continues to reveal light and truth pertaining to the operation of His king -\\ndom and the things of eternity. The canonical book of Doctrine and Covenants serves as the \\nscriptural repository of the revelations of Joseph Smith and his prophetic successors.\\n10 The tenth article briefly encapsulates the Latter-day Saints’ eschatology, or the theology of \\nthe ultimate destiny of humanity, the end times, the Millennium, and Final Judgment. The \\ncomponents that constitute Joseph Smith’s eschatology as defined in this article are scattered \\nthroughout Restoration scripture and are the literal gathering of Israel (3 Nephi 20–22; Doc -\\ntrine and Covenants 110:11), the building up of Zion (Doctrine and Covenants 6:6; 11:6; \\n12:6; 14:6: 45:66–67; 57:1–3), Christ’s return to rule on earth (Doctrine and Covenants 29:11;', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 149', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='The Articles of Faith   |   147 \\n45:55–59; 101:22–34; 133:25, 42–52), and the regeneration of the earth into celestial glory \\n(Doctrine and Covenants 29:23–25; 43:32; 77:1; 88:17–20; 130:8–11). Glosses . The T&S  ver-\\nsion of this article simply read, “Zion will be built upon this continent. ” The 1851 Pearl of \\nGreat Price printed in England adds the gloss “(American)” after the demonstrative article, \\nprobably to avoid confusing European readers. Orson Pratt dropped the gloss in the 1878 Salt \\nLake City edition. It was picked up again in the 1902 edition, where it was offset in brackets \\nwith the definite article (“[the American]”). The 1976 edition added “(the New Jerusalem)” \\nafter “Zion” and incorporated “(American)” into the text, so that the verse now reads, “That \\nZion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent. ”\\n11 Latter-day Saints greatly value religious freedom for all men and women. The urgency they \\nhave attached this universal right originates, in part, from their own history of persecution \\nbecause of their faith. In 1841, the Nauvoo city council passed an ordinance declaring that \\n“the Catholics, Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Latter-day Saints, Quakers, Episcopalians \\nUniversalist Unitarians, Mahommedans [Muslims], and all other religious sects and denom -\\ninations whatever, shall have free toleration and equal privileges in this city. ” Doctrine and \\nCovenants 134:1–4 outlines the Saints’ belief that one of the roles of government is to ensure \\nthe protection of religious freedom.\\n12 In principle, Latter-day Saints affirm the importance of submitting to the law and being \\nconscientious citizens of their respective nations. Doctrine and Covenants 134:5–8 outlines \\nthe Saints’ belief on this point. However, historically there have been times when the Saints \\nhave practiced civil disobedience when they felt laws were unjustly encroaching on their \\nrights. The most notable example of this was their opposition to the anti-polygamy laws enact -\\ned by the United States federal government in the late nineteenth century. These extraordinary \\nexceptions, however, do not otherwise justify the flaunting of laws or government authority \\nbased on personal whim or preference.11We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to \\nthe dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same \\nprivilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.\\n12We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magis -\\ntrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.', metadata={'title': 'Pearl of Great Price Study Edition page 150', 'source': '../data/raw/pdfs/the-pearl-of-great-price:-a-study-edition-for-latter-day-saints.pdf'}), Document(page_content='148   |   The Articles of Faith\\n13 The final article lists just a few of the virtues that Latter-day Saints strive to emulate: honesty, \\nloyalty, chastity, and benevolence.
